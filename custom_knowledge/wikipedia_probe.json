Mayo faced Westmeath at the NUI Galway Connacht GAA Air Dome in Bekan on the 12th of February at 7pm. Mayo started the game well with a goal by Maria Reilly in the 1st minute, but Westmeath quickly responded with a point and converted penalty. The game was frantic for the first 15 minutes with both sides getting scores, but over time Mayo slowly began to build up a lead. Goals for Shauna Howley, Sinead Cafferky, another for Maria Reilly and points from several players led to Mayo having a commanding lead at half-time, a score line of 4\u201311 to 1-05. In the second half, Mayo pulled farther ahead with goals from Laura Moran, Sinead Walsh, and Ava Keane. Mayo's substitutes had a big impact, and 11 different scorers got on the board throughout the game. Though Westmeath had some positive spells in the second half, Mayo continued to score and ran away with the game, a final score line of 7\u201322 to 1\u201312. Mayo next faced Galway away on the 27th of February in Tuam Stadium. The game started at pace, with a goal a piece in the first 6 minutes. Mayo had the wind advantage in the first half and they used it effectively. Mayo's counterattack was swift, and 3 goals from Sinead Walsh, Ciara Whyte, and Lisa Cafferky led to a commanding 3\u20133 to 1\u201303 score line at half time. In the second half Mayo continued the pressure, with Sinead Cafferky scoring a goal within the first 2 minutes, and Lisa Cafferky and Sinead Walsh scoring soon after. With the wind in their favour, Galway mounted somewhat of a comeback, scoring a penalty and several points, but with excellent defending Mayo ran out the game comfortable winners, a final score line of 6\u201306 to 2-08, booking their place in the semi-final of the division 1 league. In round 3, Mayo faced Donegal at Connacht Centre of Excellence in Bekan on the 6th of March",

The rise of Great Zimbabwe parallels the rise of Kilwa. Great Zimbabwe was a major source of gold. Its royal court lived in luxury, wore Indian cotton, surrounded themselves with copper and gold ornaments, and ate on plates from as far away as Persia and China. Around the 1420s and 1430s, Great Zimbabwe was on decline. The city was abandoned by 1450. Some have attributed the decline to the rise of the trading town Ingombe Ilede.A new chapter of Shona history ensued. Nyatsimba Mutota, a northern Shona king of the Karanga, engaged in conquest. He and his son Mutope conquered the Zimbabwe Plateau, going through Mozambique to the east coast, linking the empire to the coastal trade. They called their empire \"Wilayatu 'l Mu'anamutapah\" or \"mwanamutapa\" (Lord of the Plundered Lands), or the Kingdom of Mutapa. \"Monomotapa\" was the Portuguese corruption. They did not build stone structures; the northern Shonas had no traditions of building in stone. After the death of Matope in 1480, the empire split into two small empires: Torwa in the south and Mutapa in the north. The split occurred over rivalry from two Shona lords, Changa and Togwa, with the \"mwanamutapa\" line. Changa was able to acquire the south, forming the Kingdom of Butua with its capital at Khami.The Mutapa Empire continued in the north under the \"mwenemutapa\" line. During the 16th century the Portuguese were able to establish permanent markets up the Zambezi River in an attempt to gain political and military control of Mutapa. They were partially successful. In 1628, a decisive battle allowed them to put a puppet \"mwanamutapa\" named Mavura, who signed treaties that gave favorable mineral export rights to the Portuguese.

(However, since July 2006, a federal income tax credit has been available on monthly transit passes. For those able to buy a pass and wait for their federal transit tax credit, which is 15 percent, the threshold is reduced to 43 trips per month.). The TTC introduced the Metropass in 1980. At that time, there was only one price, based on the adult fare. The pass was not transferable and had to be used with TTC-issued photo ID cards (in about 2000, the TTC also began accepting Ontario driver's licences as ID). A lower-price Metropass for seniors was added in 1984, and for students in 1991 (originally at a slightly higher rate than seniors). The magnetic strip was added to the pass in 1990, allowing it to operate automatic turnstiles, even though this meant that the user's ID would then not normally be checked.. To combat fraud and sharing the pass amongst riders, a printable box was placed on the right-hand side of the card. To make the pass valid for the month, the commuter hand-printed the digits of either the commuter's Metropass photo ID card, if the commuter had one, or the commuter's initials and abbreviated gender if the commuter used other ID. The holder of the pass was also required to show the commuter's Metropass photo ID card or another piece of Government of Ontario-issued identification at the same time that the holder presented their pass.. From 1992 to 2009, free parking for Metropass users was provided at certain subway-station parking lots. Some lots were restricted to Metropass users.. In February 1993, the Metropass became the same size as a credit card and could be swiped at subway stations. The new design was a simple mono-coloured and two-shaded design, with the abbreviation of the month in a large font, and the year placed beneath it in the same typeface and colour.

Rad\u00f3 formed several intelligence groups in France and Germany, before arriving in Switzerland in late 1936 with his family. In 1936 Rad\u00f3 formed Geopress, a news agency specialising in maps and geographic information as a cover for intelligence work, and after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, the business began to flourish. In 1940, Rad\u00f3 met Alexander Foote, an English Soviet agent, who joined Ursula Kuczynski's network in 1938, and who would become the most important radio operator for Rad\u00f3's network. In March 1942, Rad\u00f3 made contact with Rudolf Roessler who would become the most important source of information. Roessler was able to provide prompt access to the secrets of the German High Command. This included the pending details of Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union and many more, over a period of two years. A 1949 study by MI5 concluded that Roessler was a true mercenary who demanded payments for his reports that ran into thousands of Swiss francs over the course of the war years. This resulted in D\u00fcbendorfer being continually short of money, as Soviet intelligence insisted the link be maintained.. Rad\u00f3 established three networks in Switzerland.

The club went on to organize their own events, including trials and races, for both men and women. In 1931 they planned a forty-mile race in Surrey and Kent in which men competed and the club members officiated. In 1935 they announced the first women-only team trials event. The club also organised recreational events for its members.Starting in 1930, the club published a magazine for its members.",

Once David realized that Jill's daughter-in-law, Nina Webster, had just inherited a sizable fortune from her deceased husband, Phillip Chancellor III, he wanted to acquire it from her. Nina started dating David. She fell for him despite the warnings of her best friends Christine \"Cricket\" Blair, Danny Romalotti and Chase Benson who were all suspicious of David's motives.. David threatened Christine that he would cut up her face and she would never model again if she did not stay out of his business. Christine told Nina, but Nina was so in love she did not believe her. David and Nina shocked everyone by quickly eloping, and he signed a prenuptial agreement to prove his love. Nina set up David in a company named David A.

Deterioration of nitrate film is often categorized in six stages, or levels:. Acetate deterioration.. While considered \"safety film\" as it produces less hazards than nitrate, cellulose acetate still faces stability issues. The deterioration of acetate is autocatalytic just like nitrate: once the deterioration process starts, the degradation products induce further deterioration. If not properly cared for and preserved, cellulose acetate will become acidic, and face many of the same issues that nitrate faces. Deteriorated acetate can also emit a noticeable odor, and can cause the same skin, eye, and respiratory irritations as nitrate does, in addition to dizziness and lightheadedness.. Types of deterioration... Caused by the loss of elasticity in the plastic film base over time. The film can snap or break under strain, and will no longer have flexibility.. Shrinkage.. The loss of the original dimensionality of the film and is irreversible.. Distortion.. Distortion is caused by uneven shrinkage across a film's dimension and starts to warp or curl. This can be due to the difference in shrinkage between the film and emulsion layers, or areas of the film that start to shrink more than other areas. Temporary distortion can be reversed, but permanent distortion cannot.. Gelatin and base decomposition.. As the film is exposed to moisture, heat, and acids, nitrogen oxides are produced, which creates nitric acid. These promote silver corrosion and decompose the gelatin emulsion layer. The chemical reactions that occur cause further nitrate decay. Softness and stickiness occur and the image starts to fade away. This is irreversible.. Silver mirroring and fading (black and white)..

While Frontier had initially claimed it had no plans to change FiOS TV prices until 2012, it substantially raised the rates in February 2011 citing rising programming costs, by 50% in some regions. It also instituted a $500 installation fee for new television subscribers and began removing itself from TV franchise agreements in some cities in Oregon. After a significant drop in Fiber TV subscribers, in 2011 Frontier retracted the rate increases except in Indiana. On December 16, 2011, Frontier moved from the NYSE to the NASDAQ stock exchange, trading under the same \"FTR\" symbol. Frontier Communications Parent, Inc. was added to S&amp;P 400. 2014-2021. On October 24, 2014, Frontier acquired AT&amp;T's operations in Connecticut, including wireline, DSL, U-verse video, and satellite TV businesses for $2 billion, merging various subsidiaries such as Southern New England Telephone and SNET America into Frontier Communications of Connecticut. In 2015, Frontier moved its headquarters from Stamford, Connecticut to Norwalk, Connecticut. Also in 2015, Frontier settled a class action lawsuit alleging slower than advertised DSL speeds in West Virginia. Without admitting wrongdoing, Frontier agreed to invest $150 million on infrastructure in the region and provide discounted rates for affected clients until faster speeds were implemented, which occurred in 2017. Aiming to replace the old copper system with fiber optic technology, Frontier invested another $100 million into its West Virginia network in 2023. On April 1, 2016, Verizon sold its TV, internet, and landline phone business in Florida, Texas, and California to Frontier for $10. 5 billion, in a deal that doubled Frontier's size. Maggie Wilderotter served as CEO and chairperson from November 2004 to April 2015, when she was succeeded by Daniel J. McCarthy as CEO. In February 2018, Frontier had experienced an 8% annual revenue decline, outpacing attempts to cut costs. With revenue also declining in 2019 to about $8. 1 billion across 29 states, \"Bloomberg News\" reported in January 2020 that Frontier was \"asking creditors to help craft a turnaround deal\" that potentially included filing for bankruptcy. Succeeding Daniel J. McCarthy, Bernie Han became CEO that month. Frontier Communications filed for bankruptcy on April 14, 2020. With the restructuring plan expected to reduce debt by around $10 billion, it wiped out profits for shareholders who had already lost 90% that year.

TV5 renewed its partnership with Viva Entertainment in October 2020, focusing on local versions of foreign programming and TV remakes of Viva classic films. From January 2016 until December 31, 2018, TV5 and Cignal, through Hyper, served as the official free-to-air and pay television partners, respectively, for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) in the Philippines. In July 2016, TV5 started airing selected programs from MTV and MTV International as part of a deal with Viacom International Media Networks. The new \"MTV on TV5\" block included shows like \"Catfish\", \"Ridiculousness,\" and \"Ex on the Beach. \". On September 8, 2016, TV5 cancelled its locally produced programs \"Aksyon Bisaya\" and \"Aksyon Dabaw\" due to cost-cutting measures. However, the personnel remained employed to continue filing reports for the national edition of \"Aksyon\". TV5 President and CEO Emmanuel \"Noel\" C. Lorenzana stepped down on September 30, 2016, and was replaced by basketball coach and Sports5/D5 Studio head Vicente \"Chot\" Reyes. Following Reyes' appointment, the network announced a retrenchment of approximately 200 employees as part of TV5's digitalization efforts. In April 2017, TV5 acquired the rights to air WWE programming after Fox Philippines decided not to renew its contract with the WWE. On October 12, 2017, TV5 Network announced its partnership with ESPN, obtaining the licensing rights for PBA, UFC, PSL, and NFL, as well as access to ESPN programs and content. The partnership led to the formation of the ESPN5 brand, which aired on TV5 and AksyonTV. The move was part of TV5's temporary shift from a general entertainment station to a sports and news channel.

She moved to New York in 2008, at the age of 19, to study physics at Adelphi University. During a Summer Undergraduate Research Experience in the wave lab at Georgia Tech, she discovered her interest in engineering. Grayson applied to PhD engineering programs at MIT, Cornell University, Columbia University, and Georgia Tech and was accepted to all four. After graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in physics from Adelphi University, she ultimately chose to attend Cornell University so she could work with Professor Ephrahim Garcia, who was also of Caribbean descent. While at Cornell, Grayson focused her research on wind power and earned her Master of Science in 2014 and her PhD in 2016, both in mechanical engineering.Career.After receiving her PhD at Cornell, Grayson was hired at Northrop Grumman and worked in the rotational program for several years, before eventually becoming a program manager.

The togata is distinguished from more popular comic genres, such as the Atellan Farce, juxtaposed with \"commedia dell'arte\", and mime.

There were three things they saw as critical to doing this: the family, the municipality and the syndicate.

In some jurisdictions, such as France and Brazil, jury trials are reserved, and compulsory, for the most severe crimes and are not available for civil cases. In Brazil, trials by jury are applied in cases of voluntary crimes against life, such as first and second degree murder, forced abortion and instigation of suicide, even if only attempted.. In others, jury trials are only available for criminal cases and very specific civil cases (malicious prosecution, civil fraud and false imprisonment).. North America.. In the United States, jury trials are available in both civil and criminal cases. In Canada, an individual charged with an indictable offence may elect to be tried by a judge alone in a provincial court, by judge alone in a superior court, or by judge and jury in a superior court; summary offences cannot be tried by jury. In England and Wales, offences are classified as summary, indictable, or either way; jury trials are not available for summary offences (using instead a summary proceeding with a panel of three lay magistrates or a district judge sitting alone), unless they are tried alongside indictable or either way offences that are themselves tried by jury, but the defendant has a right to demand trial by jury for either way offences. The situation is similar in Scotland; whereas in Northern Ireland even summary offences carry a right to jury trial, with some exceptions.. In the United States, because jury trials tend to be high profile, the general public tends to overestimate the frequency of jury trials. Approximately 150,000 jury trials are conducted in state courts annually, and an additional 5,000 jury trials are conducted in federal courts. Two-thirds of jury trials are criminal trials, while one-third are civil and \"other\" (e.g., family, municipal ordinance, traffic). Nevertheless, the vast majority of criminal cases are settled by plea bargain, which bypasses the jury trial.. Some commentators contend that the guilty-plea system unfairly coerces defendants into relinquishing their right to a jury trial.. Others contend that there never was a golden age of jury trials, but rather that juries in the early nineteenth century (before the rise of plea bargaining) were \"",

Tieri's run on the series ended with the series' 42nd issue, followed by a two-issue storyline written by Christopher Sebela and illustrated by Mirka Andolfo. By issue #45 in July 2018, Sam Humphries was the new writer for the series, with John Timms returning to provide art. The series ended in August 2020.. \"Harley Loves Joker\".. In 2017, Harley Quinn co-creator Paul Dini wrote a backup feature for Harley Quinn's \"Rebirth\" monthly series entitled \"Harley Loves Joker\", co-written by Palmiotti and illustrated by Bret Blevins, which ran for 9 issues. The story brought back Harley Quinn's classic characterization and focuses on her past with the Joker. Unlike her characterization in \"Batman: The Animated Series\", Dini and Palmiotti wrote Harley Quinn in the story as less of a \"doormat\", with Harley Quinn and Joker being on equal footing in their relationship. The story concluded with the two-part limited series of the same name, which also expanded on Harley Quinn's past as a former intern in animal research at S.T.A.R. Labs, where she met",

Most ended up in plantation economies of the South, but some were taken to northern hubs of commerce, such as Boston, which was then under European colonial rule and had a long historical association with African slavery.. In the 18th century, slaves in Boston were the descendants of this small population of enslaved Africans that ended up in the British colonies of New England.. Modern estimates suggest that enslaved Black African people made up 10-15% of Boston's 18th century population. Additionally, there were many forms of \"unfreedom\" that confined Black and Indigenous peoples and poor white Europeans. Until slavery was abolished in Massachusetts in 1783, it was commonplace for wealthy families in and around Boston to enslave Black and Indigenous peoples as supplemental to household labor. Many of Old North's members enslaved people, or profited off of their involvement in enterprises dependent on enslaved labor.

The project was canceled due to the 2011 Libyan civil war. In November 2015, a Chinese biotech company Boyalife Group announced that it would partner with Hwang's laboratory, Sooam Biotech, to open the world's largest animal cloning factory in Tianjin. His alleged success was touted as the fifth instance in the world in cow cloning, with a notable caveat: Hwang failed to provide scientifically verifiable data for the research, giving only media sessions and photo ops. Following on the earlier success, on August 3, 2005, Hwang announced that his team of researchers had become the first team to successfully clone a dog, which was independently verified through genetic testing. Shortly after his groundbreaking 2005 work, Hwang was appointed to head the new World Stem Cell Hub, a facility that was to be the world's leading stem cell research center. During the conference, Roh admitted that he had paid women US$1,400 each for donating their eggs which were later used in Hwang's research. Roh claimed Hwang was unaware of this, while the South Korean Ministry of Health asserted that no laws or ethical guidelines had been breached as there were no commercial interests involved.

After returning from a holiday on Earth, Fee and the crew of \"Toy Box 2\" find a piece of classified debris, a United States Navy orbital mine. With a space war looming, Fee leads an anti-war movement to prevent Kessler Syndrome and becomes a media sensation when Colonel Sanders uses her as a hero of the anti-war movement, without her consent. Fee recounts her experience with her uncle in the American South, particularly the racism that he encountered as an unemployed, reclusive black man living in the woods. The crew of \"Toy Box 2\" are returned to Earth, where Fee goes home to her family and attempts to resume her life as a mother. She crashes her motorcycle while avoiding a dog, but she befriends the dog and drags her motorcycle back home. The captain of \"Von Braun\" struggles with the speech he will give when the ship reaches Jupiter, resulting in him being hospitalized with a stomach ulcer. Hachimaki makes his speech when \"Von Braun\" arrives at Jupiter, concluding that he's perfectly satisfied with what he already has, and giving up on his dream of owning his own spaceship.

One day in a library, he came across a scientific book that talked about the remains of spacecraft and satellites that were in Earth orbit. Yukimura found it really interesting to know that these debris were dangerous for us, and that, at some point in life, he meant, a few light years from now, these debris would be seriously disturbing the progress of the planet. Upon finishing the book, Yukimura decided to write a manga about this concept. There were not major influences other than Arthur C. Clarke. While their works are not the same, he was moved by the dilemmas of his theories. He then researched Japanese writers and was moved by Tani Koshu. \"Plan",

Second generation (UN105/150; 1995).. For the 1995 model year, Ford released a second generation of the Explorer. Following the success of the first generation, the redesign of the exterior was largely evolutionary, with the model line receiving front bodywork distinct from the Ranger. Rear-wheel drive remained standard, with part-time four-wheel drive offered as an option, and all-wheel drive was introduced as an option.. To better compete against the Jeep Grand Cherokee, a V8 was introduced as an optional engine. The Explorer went from lacking airbags to having dual airbags (a first for an American-brand SUV).. The Lincoln-Mercury division introduced its first SUV for the 1997 model year, the Mercury Mountaineer. In contrast to the Mazda Navajo, the Mountaineer was sold only as a five-door. For 2001, Ford introduced the Ford Explorer Sport Trac mid-size crew-cab pickup truck based on the five-door Explorer. Following the introduction of the third-generation Explorer for 2002, the three-door used the second-generation body style through the 2003 model year.. Chassis.. The second-generation Ford Explorer is based upon the Ford U1 platform shared with its predecessor, adopting the UN105/UN150 model codes. Introducing key chassis upgrades that were also shared with the 1998 Ford Ranger, the long-running Twin I-Beam/Twin Traction Beam front suspension was retired in favor of a short/long-arm (SLA) wishbone front suspension configuration in order to accommodate larger engines. Along with more compact packaging of front suspension components (allowing for a lower hoodline), the design allowed for improved on-road handling/feel. In line with the Ranger and F-Series trucks, the rear suspension remained a leaf-sprung live rear axle.. The standard four-wheel ABS of the previous generation returned; the rear drum brakes were replaced by disc brakes. As with the first generation, rear-wheel drive remained standard with part",

Sitting at a typewriter at home, Hillebrand typed out random sentences and counted every letter, number, punctuation mark, and space. Under SS7, it is a \"state\" with 160 characters of data, coded in the ITU-T \"T. This was part of ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network), and since GSM is based on this, it made its way to the mobile phone. The possibility of doing something is one thing; implementing it is another, but systems existed in 1988 that sent SMS messages to mobile phones (compare ND-NOTIS). SMS messaging was used for the first time on 3 December 1992, at the Three Tuns Public House in Reading, Berkshire, when Neil Papworth, a 22-year-old test engineer for Sema Group in the UK (now Airwide Solutions), used a personal computer to send the text message \"Merry Christmas\" via the Vodafone network to the phone of Richard Jarvis, who was at a party in Newbury, Berkshire, which had been organized to celebrate the event. Modern SMS text messaging is usually sent from one mobile phone to another. When Radiolinja's domestic competitor, Telecom Finland (now part of TeliaSonera), also launched SMS text messaging in 1995 and the two networks offered cross-network SMS functionality, Finland became the first nation where SMS text messaging was offered on a competitive as well as a commercial basis. GSM was allowed in the United States, but the radio frequencies were blocked and awarded to US \"Carriers\" to use US technology, which limited development of mobile messaging services in the US. The GSM in the US had to use a frequency allocated for private communication services (PCS) \u2013 what the ITU frequency r\u00e9gime had blocked for DECT (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications) \u2013 a 1000-foot range picocell, but it survived. APC operated under the brand name Sprint Spectrum and launched its service on 15 November 1995, in Washington, D., and Baltimore, Maryland., made the initial phone call to launch the network, calling Mayor Kurt Schmoke in Baltimore.

Origin Energy would be broken up with EIG taking the liquefied natural gas unit.Legal actions.The Carlyle Group acquisition of TCW.In August 2012, EIG filed a lawsuit to prevent a deal where The Carlyle Group would acquire its former parent, TCW. EIG alleged the deal violated certain contractual rights granted to EIG as part of its separation from TCW. It resolved around a joint venture between EIG and TCW that was put in place at the time of the spin off to act as a central clearing house for sharing some of the economics of EIG's funds with TCW. The deal would put EIG's proprietary information into the hands of Carlyle which EIG deemed a direct competitor. However sources stated the EIG's real purpose behind the lawsuit was to server all ties with TCW by using the company's ability to block the acquisition as leverage.In January 2013, EIG came to an agreement with the parties and dropped its lawsuit opposing the deal.

Chimaeras are soft-bodied, shark-like fish with bulky heads and long, tapered tails; measured from the tail, they can grow up to in length. Like other members of the class Chondrichthyes, chimaera skeletons are entirely cartilaginous, or composed of cartilage. Their skin is smooth and relatively free of scales or unique features, lacking the keeled, tooth-like placoid scales (denticles) present on sharks and rays. However, there are still exceptions, as hatchlings retain a few rows of denticles on the back, and adult males bear denticulated sexual organs. The gill arches are condensed into a pouch-like bundle covered by a sheet of skin (an operculum), with a single gill-opening in front of the pectoral fins. The pectoral fins are large enough to generate lift and a relaxed forward momentum, giving the chimaera the appearance of \"flying\" through the water. Further back on the body are also a pair of smaller pelvic fins, and some genera bear an anal fin in front of the tail. In many species, the bulbous snout is modified into an elongated sensory organ, capable of electroreception to find prey. This contrasts with modern sharks, where the palatoquadrate is movable and detachable, a trait known as hyostyly. The back of the head is supported by a complex of fused vertebrae called the synarcual, which also connects to the dorsal fin spine. Instead of sharks\u2019 many sharp, consistently-replaced teeth, chimaeras have just six large, permanent tooth-plates, which grow continuously throughout their entire life. These tooth-plates are arranged in three pairs, with one pair at the tip of the lower jaws and two pairs along the upper jaws.

There was great indifference about fitness, still more about elegance of style. Prose needed to be restored for the sake of national dignity, and it was believed that this could not be done except by going back to the writers of the 14th century, to the \"aurei trecentisti\", as they were called, or else to the classics of Italian literature. One of the promoters of the new school was Antonio Cesari of Verona, who republished ancient authors, and brought out a new edition, with additions, of the \"Vocabolario della Crusca\". He wrote a dissertation \"Sopra lo stato presente della lingua italiana\", and endeavoured to establish the supremacy of Tuscan and of the three great writers, Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio. In accordance with that principle he wrote several books, taking pains to copy the \"trecentisti\" as closely as possible. But patriotism in Italy has always had something municipal in it; so to this Tuscan supremacy, proclaimed and upheld by Cesari, there was opposed a Lombard school, which would know nothing of Tuscan, and with Dante's \"De vulgari eloquentia\" returned to the idea of the \"lingua illustre\".. This was an old question, largely and bitterly argued in the \"Cinquecento\" (16th century) by Benedetto Varchi, Muzio Manfredi, Lodovico Castelvetro, Sperone Speroni, and others. Now the question was raised afresh. At the head of the Lombard school were Monti and his son-in-law Count Giulio Perticari. This caused Vincenzo Monti to write \"Proposta di alcune correzioni ed aggiunte al vocabolario della Crusca\", in which he attacked the Tuscanism of the Accademia della Crusca, but in a graceful and easy style, so as to form a prose that is one of the most beautiful in Italian literature.

Schneider's inexpensive, classic Xenar asymmetrical, anastigmatic, 4-element, 3-group lens design was introduced in 1919, and is largely unchanged from the original Zeiss Tessar formula.

The Grafik-Clarons are 6-element, 4-group, symmetrical plasmat-type lenses with a 64\u00b0 angle of coverage, designed for 1:1 flat-field reproduction, but can be used as macro lenses at magnifications up to 5:1 as well.. G-Claron WA.. A wide-angle process lens with 4 elements in 4 groups, optimized for reproduction ratios between 2:1 and 1:2. The 270 mm lens has an angle of coverage of 72\u00b0, the 240 mm has 80\u00b0, and the 210 mm has 86\u00b0, which give these lenses gigantic image circles, though the image softens considerably near the edges of coverage.. Repro-Claron.. The Repro-Claron is a line of 4-element, 4-group lenses optimized for 1:1 reproduction ratios, but still usable at infinity. The f/9 lenses also have a slot for between-the-lens filtration or Waterhouse stops, the latter of which are available in f/128, f/180, and f/260.. Apo-Artar..

She wrote a dream-pop and synth-pop to explore Gillman's (Condor) life on land and underwater.

Who'll be a sojer for Marlboro with me?&lt;/poem&gt; The song sung today has the musical form, AABA and is sung to the same tune as Marie Cowan\u2019s \u2018Waltzing Matilda\u2019, published in Sydney, Australia, in 1903. It describes events as happening in Rochester, England, during the reign of Queen Ann, 1702 to 1714. It was widely, though not universally accepted, that the song was written at that time. English folklore authority, Ralph Vaughan Williams, considered that the language used in the song was not appropriate to 1700. The song has the musical form AABA which suggests a much later origin and there is no documentary proof that 'The Bold Fusilier' existed before 1900. The origin of \u2018Waltzing Matilda\u2019 can be traced from \u2018Thou Bonny Wood of Craigie Lee\u2019 published in 1818. Hearsay evidence exists that \u2018Waltzing Matilda' was sung by Australian soldiers in South Africa during the Boer War and that the British troops returned friendly fire by singing \u2019The Gay/Bold Fusilier\u2019 as a parody.. In about 1970, English folk singer, Peter Coe, reworked the existing first verse and chorus and added another four verses. This song, a timeless comment about war, is quite popular today and has spawned other similar lyrics. Peter\u2019s song is called \u2018The Rochester Recruiting Sergeant\u2019.. Ownership.. On January 12, 1903, Paterson sold the rights to \"Waltzing Matilda\" and \"some other pieces\" to Angus &amp; Robertson for \"a fiver\", five Australian pounds. A good shearer could easily make more than that in a week. Very soon after, tea trader, James Inglis, owner of Inglis and Co., purchased the musical rights to \u2018Waltzing Matilda\u2019 from Angus and Robertson for 5 guineas (5 pounds and 5 shillings).

Declarations in modules form their own interface specifications, and it is not necessary to have both interface and implementation sections. If a separate interface declaration file is needed, it is created by stripping the code out of a module and creating a \"skeleton\" of the module. This is typically done only if the object for a module is to be sent out without the source.. Modules must occupy a single file, and modules reference other modules via a uses or joins statement. To allow this, a module must bear the same name as its file name. The uses statement indicates that the referenced module will have its global declarations merged with the referencing module, and any name conflicts that result will cause an error. The joins statement will cause the referenced module to be accessible via the referencing module, but does not merge the name spaces of the two modules. Instead, the referencing module must use a so-called \"qualified identifier\":. A program from ISO 7185 Pascal is directly analogous to a module, and is effectively a module without an exit section. Because all modules in the system are \"daisy chained\" such that each are executed in order, a program assumes \"command\" of the program simply because it does not exit its initialization until its full function is complete, unlike a module which does. In fact, it is possible to have multiple program sections, which would execute in sequence..

The reforming movement sought to throw off the conventional and the artificial, and to return to truth. Apostolo Zeno and Pietro Metastasio (the Arcadian name for Pietro Trapassi, a native of Rome) had endeavoured to make melodrama and reason compatible. Metastasio gave fresh expression to the affections, a natural turn to the dialogue and some interest to the plot; if he had not fallen into constant unnatural overrefinement and mawkishness, and into frequent anachronisms, he might have been considered the most important writer of \"opera seria\" libretti and the first dramatic reformer of the 18th century.. Carlo Goldoni.. Carlo Goldoni, a Venetian, overcame resistance from the old popular form of comedy, with the masks of \"pantalone\", of the doctor, \"harlequin\", Brighella, etc., and created the comedy of character, following Moli\u00e8re's example. Goldoni's characters are often superficial, but he wrote lively dialogue. He produced over 150 comedies, and had no time to polish and perfect his works; but for a comedy of character we must go straight from Machiavelli's \"Mandragola\" to him. Goldoni's dramatic aptitude is illustrated by the fact that he took nearly all his types from Venetian society, yet managed to give them an inexhaustible variety. Many of his comedies were written in Venetian.. His works include some of Italy's most famous and best-loved plays. Audiences have admired the plays of Goldoni for their ingenious mix of wit and honesty. His plays offered his contemporaries images of themselves, often dramatizing the lives, values, and conflicts of the emerging middle classes.

She died in Miguel's arms.. Miguel would continue to serve as the Newman's butler/house manager until 2008, though he wasn't seen after 2006.

Motunau / Plate Island is a small island in the Bay of Plenty, roughly off New Zealand's North Island at Okurei Point and a similar distance east-south-east from the much larger M<unk> t<unk> t<unk> Island. The island is split into northern and southern portions by a small channel as narrow as across, with several small sea stacks surrounding the two main parts of the island. Like many of the other islands in the Bay of Plenty, Motunau is volcanic in origin and lacks any permanent fresh water source, and as a result has not seen permanent settlement by humans.The lack of human interaction with the island or introduced predators has led to Motunau becoming home to a range of native animal species, including a population of tuatara, as well as a breeding colony of kekeno (New Zealand fur seals) and several seabirds. As a result of this, the island was legally protected as a wildlife sanctuary in 1969, and in 2021 the surrounding ocean was designated a Marine Protection Area.History.Motunau has held significance for local M<unk> ori as a navigational marker and mahinga kai (food gathering site) since before P<unk> keh<unk> settlement.

A number of African Commonwealth nations led by President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia and President Julius Nyerere of Tanzania threatened to leave the Commonwealth if Britain continued with the arms sales to South Africa. When British Prime Minister Edward Heath visited Ottawa in December 1970, his meetings with Trudeau went badly. In what was described as a \"no holds-barred\" style, Trudeau told Heath that the British arms sales to white supremacist South Africa were threatening the unity of the Commonwealth. At a Commonwealth summit in Singapore between 14 and 22 January 1971, Trudeau argued that \"apartheid\" was not sustainable in the long run given that the black population of South Africa vastly outnumbered the white population, and it was extremely myopic for Britain to be supporting South Africa, given that majority rule in South Africa was inevitable. However, Trudeau worked for a compromise to avoid a split in the Commonwealth, arguing that the Commonwealth needed to do more to pressure South Africa to end \"apartheid\" peacefully, saying that a \"race war\" in South Africa would be the worse possible way to end \"apartheid\". The conference ended with the compromise agreement that Britain would complete its existing arms contracts to South Africa, but henceforward sell no more weapons to South Africa; ultimately the British only sold South Africa five attack helicopters.

This was extensively cited as the philosophical foundation to justify the usage of the Pronouncing Orthography by the likes of William Torrey Harris. Dr Edwin Leigh himself published a report quantifying the levels of illiteracy in the United States, which he used to advocate for his Pronouncing Orthography. Orthographic reform.Attempts to remedy this issue have been ongoing without success since the Elizabethan era, when spelling conventions were becoming entrenched due to the printing revolution and the problems from an irregular orthography were being noticed; John Hart was the earliest known proponent of English orthographic reform during the 16th century. The main attempt at orthographic reform in the 19th century was published in 1844 by Isaac Pitman and Alexander John Ellis, who jointly developed Fonotypy as an exemplar of regularised English orthography. To demonstrate Fonotypy's efficacy and prove the case for orthographic reform, Fonotypy was used to teach children and illiterate adults in Britain and the United States of America; this culminated in a large-scale experiment in ten schools with 800 pupils in Waltham, Massachusetts, between 1852 &amp; 1860. The chairman of Waltham's school committee minuted the result: \u2013 \"It has been proved in repeated experiments that if a child, upon first learning letters, is taught the Phonetic Alphabet, and is confined to Phonetic books for the first 6\u20138 months of schooling, he will at the end of his first year's schooling read common print and spell in common spelling better than children ordinarily do, at the end of 4\u20135 years of schooling.\"...[Reverend Thomas Hill]Interim teaching medium.Although orthographic reformers had expected significant literacy improvements from phonetically pure orthography, they had not expected the children and newly literate adults to effortlessly transition to become literate in the standard, irregular orthography and have better spelling than people who had learnt conventionally. So there emerged the realisation that orthographic reform may be unnecessary since a phonetically regular orthography could be used as an \"interim teaching medium\" to achieve the same goals as full-scale ortho",

The coarser fibers, which are called \"jute butts\", are used alone or combined with other fibers to make many products:. Finer jute fibers can be processed for use in:. Jute was historically used in traditional textile machinery because jute fibers contain cellulose (vegetable fiber) and lignin (wood fiber). Later, several industries, such as the automotive, pulp and paper, furniture, and bedding industries, started to use jute and its allied fibers with their non-woven and composite technology to manufacture nonwoven fabric, technical textiles, and composites.. Jute is used in the manufacture of fabrics, such as Hessian cloth, sacking, scrim, carpet backing cloth (CBC), and canvas. Hessian is lighter than sacking, and it is used for bags, wrappers, wall-coverings, upholstery, and home furnishings. Sacking, which is a fabric made of heavy jute fibers, has its use in the name. CBC made of jute comes in two types: primary and secondary. Primary CBC provides a tufting surface, while secondary CBC is bonded onto the primary backing for an overlay. Jute packaging is sometimes used as an environmentally friendly substitute for plastic. Other jute consumer products include floor coverings, high performance technical textiles, geotextiles, and composites. Jute has been used as a home textile due to its anti-static and color- and light-fast properties, as well as its strength, durability, UV protection, sound and heat insulation, and low thermal conductivity. \"Corchous olitorius\" leaves are used to make mulukhiya, which is sometimes considered the Egyptian national dish, and is also consumed in Cyprus and other Middle Eastern countries. These leaves are an ingredient in stews, typically cooked with lamb or chicken. In India (West Bengal) and Bangladesh, in the Bengali cuisine, the fresh leaves are stir fried and eaten as \"path saak bhaja\" (<unk> <unk> <unk> ) along with a mustard sauce called \"kasundi\" (<unk> ). The leaves are also eaten by making \"pakoras\" (<unk> <unk> <unk> ) with rice flour or Gram flour",

In the cultural climate of those years, the neo-idealistic and Hegelian currents were prevailing, and they ranged from the teaching of Benedetto Croce to the most exasperated expressions of nationalism and spiritualism. Togliatti would always declare that he remained a stranger to the latter; it is certain that Croce in particular, then \"La Voce\" of Giuseppe Prezzolini and Giovanni Papini, and Gaetano Salvemini and Romain Rolland had no small part in his youthful formation. The first approach to Marxism would have occurred all through the writings of Antonio Labriola; the decisive elements that led Togliatti to Marxist socialism were his friendship with Gramsci and the concrete social reality of Turin, which saw the development of a strong and organised workers' movement.. Initially permanently discharged from military service due to physical incapacity (a severe short-sightedness), Togliatti served as a volunteer army officer during the war, and he was later wounded in action and sent home to recuperate. In 1915, he had volunteered for the Red Cross, serving in various hospitals, including at the front. Meanwhile, wartime needs led the military commands to review the enlistment criteria, so he was declared able and enlisted in 1916; he was assigned to the 54th Infantry Regiment and then moved, at his request, to the 2nd Alpini Regiment. In 1917, Togliatti was admitted to the official cadet course in Caserta; he passed it but did not obtain the appointment as an officer due to a serious pleurisy that had occurred in the meantime. He gained the rank of \"caporale maggiore\" (major caporal) in health care, and he was discharged in December 1918 at the end of a long leave..

        "train_context": "Robert Todd Lincoln. Some commentators believe that Lincoln had a distant relationship with his father, in part because, during his formative years, Abraham Lincoln spent months on the judicial circuit. Lincoln recalled, \"During my childhood and early youth he was almost constantly away from home, attending court or making political speeches. \". Abraham apparently realized that his being away had a potential impact on his sons as evidenced by the following quote from his April 16, 1848, letter to his wife: \"don't let the blessed fellows forget Father\". One such example that gives insight into Robert's childhood in general was related by Joseph Humphreys, who had taken a train to Lexington, Kentucky, in 1847: \"there were two lively youngsters on board who kept the whole train in a turmoil, and their long-legged father, instead of spanking the brats, looked pleased as Punch and aided and abetted the older one in mischief\".. Lincoln took the Harvard College entrance examination in 1859, but failed fifteen out of the sixteen subjects. Subsequently Lincoln was enrolled at Phillips Exeter Academy to prepare for college; he graduated Phillips Exeter in 1860. After graduating from Harvard, Robert Lincoln enrolled at Harvard Law School. Lincoln attended Harvard Law School from September 1864 to January 1865, but left after four months in order to join the Union Army. Mary Todd Lincoln prevented Robert Lincoln from joining the Army until shortly before the war's conclusion. He served in the last weeks of the American Civil War on General Grant's staff, a status which meant, in all likelihood, he would not be involved in actual combat. He was present at Appomattox when Robert E. Lee surrendered. The exact date is uncertain, but it is believed to have taken place in late 1863 or early 1864, before John Wilkes Booth's assassination of President Lincoln. The knowledge of whom he had saved that day was said to have been of some comfort to Booth following his brother's assassination of the president. On the night of his father's death, Robert had turned down an invitation to accompany his parents to Ford's Theatre due to fatigue after spending much of his recent time in a covered wagon at the battlefront. Ten days later, Robert Lincoln wrote President Andrew Johnson requesting that he and his family be",
