I had always assumed that they were further up the coast around Samcheok or somewhere like that. It seemed that many Korean photographers knew about these places and I was at a loss to try and find out where they were.\nThen a fellow photographer named Brian Kim, introduced me to this area near Gyeongju a few years ago. It was amazing and also perfect for my side project photographing lighthouses. The area was located in front of the Songdaemal Lighthouse in the small village of Gampo.\nOne of the first things that I noticed about Gampo was the fact that it was so quiet in the mornings. It was a place that I usually catch the sunrise and at that time, there are usually very few people around. If there are, they are usually tucked in behind a camera too.\nSmall villages like this are something that many people don\u2019t see when they arrive in Korean and hit Seoul or Busan. These villages are typically centered around the port and the fishing industry. You won\u2019t find large supermarkets here. Just the local marts and perhaps a GS25 convenience store.\nIt\u2019s that sort of small town charm that keeps me coming back, aside from the stunning seascapes and the lighthouses. One of the times that I went, an elderly man approached as I was capturing one of the most interesting lighthouse designs out there. We had a short chat and he sad that the next time that I was coming through to pop in for a coffee, gesturing at his little shack by the port. It was a simple kind gesture but it sort of showed the nature of the kind of people out there.\nWhat brings most people out to the area are usually the rocks that jut out of the water near the Songdaemal Lighthouse. During the sunrise, which is arguably the best time to photograph here, it makes for a wonderful and dynamic shot.\nThe rocks also make it a perfect place to get in nice and tight and with a long enough exposure, make a really out of the world shot. So you are not just limited to scenic shots with a centred horizon that a few photographers do. There is enough variety to really experiment with the scene a bit more.\nThis was one of the things that really amazed me. In this area along there are about 3 distinct lighthouses with unique designs. This really can only be surpassed by Gijange. However, these lighthouses all share the historical themes linked to Gyeongju.\nNot to mention that you also have a piece of history with one of the oldest lighthouses in the area standing right next to Songdaemal. For a person that is interested in these amazing structures this is a special place.\nAn interesting note is that there is actually a button to ring the bell on the lighthouse that is shaped like the bells found at buddhist temples around Korea. So it is actually functional in that respect too!\nThe bottomline is that places like this are really off the beaten path but are so worth the visit. Gampo is located about just over an hour from Busan and about 2 hours or so from Daegu.\nHere is a link to the Songdaemal on Kakao Maps to help you locate it and get directions. Don\u2019t forget that if you are driving out there, the Kakao Maps app is in English and the navigation is also in English. This app is extremely useful in finding locations like this.\nThe post Exploring Gampo: A Hidden Gem appeared first on The Sajin.<|endoftext|>ABSN vs. ADN\n\nOk,  so I've seen several older posts on this sub for the same question. To make a long story short, I tried to get into another field of medicine straight out of college and was told my lack of medical experience is what didn't help. I am seriously looking into nursing (as I did back in HS) and I want to know if I should look into an ADN program or an ABSN program, as I already have my undergrad (BA) in Biology. Ultimately I'd like to work in some specialty so I'm concerned that an ADN might limit me coming out of school, but the cost difference is also big. Fwiw, I am located smack dab in the middle of SC and what I am aware of is several big cities are starting to only hire BSN students straight out of school. I've looked at some loan forgiveness programs for the ABSN route as well, and I'm curious what all some of you might think?

The drone discovered in Samcheok, Gangwon Province on Oct. 4 last year bore the number 35.\nAll look as though they were written with marker pens.\n\"We need to investigate further what exactly the numbers mean,\" ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said. \"We've found handwritten numbers on fragments of all North Korean weapons that have recently been found.\"\nThe handwritten Arabic No. 1 was found on the fragment of a 122 mm multiple rocket launcher shell during the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island from North Korea on Nov. 23, 2010.\nThe marker \"No. 1\" handwritten with a blue marker pen was found on the propeller of the torpedo that hit the Navy corvette Cheonan on March 26, 2010.\nA North Korean light torpedo salvaged from South Korean waters in 2003 also bore the Arabic No. 4 on it.\nExperts believe the numbers are serial numbers. All of the three drones are believed to have been produced from molding presses, which means they can be mass-produced. If so, this suggests that the North has produced more than 65 such small drones.\nMarkers with Roman-Arabic numerals, \"III-1,\" \"III-2,\" and \"III-3,\" were found on the three batteries of the Samcheok drone.

Stocks highlighted in yellow are new to the list. One name that sticks out is Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL), not too much of a surprise given the current near-halt in global travel. Below, we'll take a closer look at the options activity surrounding DAL, and see how the equity has been performing on the charts.\nThe travel sector as a whole has taken a substantial hit in recent weeks as the coronavirus pandemic ravages the globe, with governments halting any unnecessary travel --international or domestic. Delta has been no exception, the stock recently bottomed out at a seven-year low of $19.10 on March 18. Overhead pressure at the 20-day moving average has also guided the shares to a 61% year-to-date deficit, while today, DAL was last seen down 7.5%, at $22.57.\nPer White's data, over the past 10 days, 145,441 calls and 184,150 puts have crossed the tape. This afternoon, most popular looks to be the April 20 put, with the April 30 call trailing closely behind. Meanwhile, overall options volume is pacing in the 99th annual percentile today.\nThis skew toward puts is not necessarily eyebrow raising, considering, the security's Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) of 1.21 sits in the 85th percentile of its annual range. In simpler terms, this suggests that short-term options players haven't been more put-heavy during the past 12 months.\nShort sellers have been heading for the exits, though. Short interest on DAL has dropped 18.5% during the most recent reporting period, and now accounts for a slim 4% of the stock's total available float. At the equity's average pace of daily trading, it would take short sellers just one day to buy back their bearish bets.<|endoftext|>No Comments on Adam4adam gay relationship app just like any online dating sites website, may not be held in charge of taken information, theft, and damage.<|endoftext|>Search Engine Optimization Services Pricing \u2013 How Much to Pay for SEO?\nIn support of any kind of company deal or purchase, it is so sensible that you need to just invest your money when you really feel comfy. As well as your comfort zone varies on numerous dependences such as just how well you find out about the business and its marketing system, particularly web marketing & SEO services etc. A high quality SEO service is the mix of estimated time period, commitment, effort, strategy, method, experience, approach, and also skill. The fact is that normally it is not a hard work, but does not indicate that it is as well very easy.\nSearch Engine Optimization solutions are normally can help your organisation to grow faster than any other medium or method. As per Google method, organizations that use the internet are most likely to expand faster than any kind of various other services that do not. Generally SEO is not an expense yet a financial investment that will certainly aid your company utilizing the web more effectively & effectively as well as get a higher return from your online outlay.\nDo not believe you will certainly pay $100 and also overnight you will certainly make thousands. Rather, develop a rational budget plan relying on your marketing strategy, affordable commercial setting, job outline, as well as a length of time. It is permanently that less costly does not constantly suggest much better.\nMost of the SEO company and designers are not going to be cheaper, yet well worth in every buck invested. In situation of various other advertising and marketing platforms, such as television broadcast advertising and marketing, print advertising and marketing, huge exhibition or reasonable booth marketing and so on, seo is just one of one of the most credible and also reliable approaches for the growth of your service. Prices of \u03c5\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03b5\u03c2 seo in between, is far more affordable and also more affordable than any various other advertising and advertising and marketing platforms. When it contrasted to various other marketing platforms, currently it comes out on top position in every step.\nHr based SEO solution is the most admired rates scheme.

This leaves me with the choice of Entire Plugin Snapshot or Parameter Sets.\nParameter Sets seems to make the most sense as it\u2019s lighter and would work well with soft synths where all the controls are generally accesible.\n4 - Save, go the next Parameter Set and repeat.\nIt\u2019s a bit of an arduous task and I feel like I\u2019m missing a better way of doing this. There is a paragraph in the User Guide (Preset Models > Changing the Base Program), which describes using a little P button to copy the parameters and name of presets in the plugin to the Cantabile rack. This would be a lifesaver. Unfortunately, this button does not appear on any of the VSTs I am using.\nAnyone who can help me out?\nWelcome to the forum. Firstly, we need to know what Cantabile version you are using. Let us know and we can begin there. Different versions have different capabilities.\nAs Corky said, but if using the Parameter or Snapshot methods, pretty much the way you are adding to your list is the way it is done.\nI have streamlined the operation by using keyboard shortcuts.\nOnce in the generic name with the desired Synth preset chosen, click the \u201chamburger menu\u201d, hit \u201cR\u201d, type in the name, Enter Key, Alt-Right-Arrow to move to next generically named preset, repeat. It moves pretty fast that way, and you get into a rhythm doing it that makes it kinda fun!\nIf you have Solo, that is where you stop, though you could copy the finished instrument and paste it into an embedded rack that you can save a copy of to have it handy to use as-is as a rack or to copy and paste out of the rack to have the drop-down list readily available.\nIf you have Performer, you can use the rack version and States to switch between different presets in the drop-down list at-will during the song by connecting it to states (via the states-manager at the bottom left of the GUI)."

Monitoring System of High Waves and Tsunami using HF Ocean Radar in the East Coast of Korea, Proceedings 13th International Coastal Symposium (Durban, South Africa), Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 70, pp. 035\u2013040, ISSN 0749-0208.\nThe east coast of Korea is exposed to the danger of tsunamis because it is contiguous to Japan. Damages took place in the region when tsunami occurred in the west of Japan in 1986 and 1993. Fear of the destruction caused by has increased following the 2011 Great Tsunami of Japan. The west coast of Japan embodies many high tsunami risk areas where tsunami may be triggered by earthquakes. As no earthquake has ever occurred there, these high risk areas contain high amount of potential energy. Furthermore, frequent high waves due to climate change have become one of the major factors with respect to coastal structure damage, beach erosion and various coastal disasters along the shoreline. In order to make a counterplan for coastal disaster, precise analysis of the high wave characteristics, through continuous monitoring, is essential. In this study, continuous long-term observation is implemented with an Ocean Radar. Ocean Radar conducts remote observation equipped with ground-based radars which enable series of simultaneous observations of extensive range of the coast with high frequency. Ocean Radar for continuous long-term observation is operated at Samcheok on the east coast of Korea. Samcheok has experienced tsunami damage in previous years and is where a nuclear power plant is located. In order to examine the reliability of the Ocean Radar, a pressure-type wave gauge, ultrasonic wave gauge, and ocean buoy are installed for data comparison and verification. The Ocean Radar used in this study is an array-type HF-RADAR named WERA (WavE RAdar). Data analysis of the continuous long-term observation verifies more than 90% of the wave data collected within 25km range from the center of two sites. Only less than 1% of the entire observation is unmeasured by time series analysis, but data from other wave gauges show similar features. Moreover, a comprehensive monitoring system supported by such observations is developed for the public for internet based real-time reports on waves and currents.\nKEYWORDS: coastal erosion, shoreline prediction, shoreline retreat, sediment shortage, GENESIS model, LIDAR data.\nAra\u00fajo, M.A.V.C., Di Bona, S., Trigo-Teixeira, A., 2014. Impact of detached breakwaters on shoreline evolution: a case study on the Portuguese west coast. In: Green, A.N. and Cooper, J.A.G. (eds.), Proceedings 13th International Coastal Symposium (Durban, South Africa), Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 70, pp. 041\u2013046, ISSN 0749-0208.\nThe Portuguese West Coast is facing severe erosion problems that threaten both the population andthe immediate seaside properties. Some locations, such as the Vagueira region, are especially vulnerable. In an attempt to reverse the present erosional trend, a coastal defense scheme involving two detached breakwaters was introduced in a phased manner. In this work, the impact of those two detached breakwaters on the down-drift coast is investigated. The study area extends from south of the Costa Nova village southwards to Mira. The shoreline evolution is predicted, for various decades, using the GENESIS model. The present time shoreline position, from which future situations are predicted, was obtained using LIDAR data acquired in 2011. Two different future scenarios are investigated: the \u2018do-nothing\u2019 scenario, which assumes that no further engineering interventions will be performed on the coast; and the \u2018detached breakwaters protected\u2019 scenario, with the first breakwater introduced in 2011 and the second in 2026. Depending on sediment supply, two types of simulations are carried out: calibrated simulations, which assume that the amount of sediments in the future will be equal to those in the present situation; and extreme simulations, which assume an acute shortage in sediment supply. Results show that if no further interventions are executed at the Vagueira region, the entire coastal stretch will continue to erode, which could lead to extreme consequences in some locations, depending on sediment supply. If two detached breakwaters are introduced at different intervals, a new accreting trend is predicted at the Vagueira region, reversing the present erosional phase. However, the erosional trend will continue southwards, unless a 3rd detached breakwater is introduced in Mira.\nKEYWORDS: Nearshore, sand spit, Pelnard-Consid\u00e8re, non-linear diffusion equation.\nBouchette, F., Manna, M., Montalvo, P., Nutz, A., Schuster, M.,Ghienne, J.-F., 2014.

(eds.), Proceedings 13th International Coastal Symposium (Durban, South Africa), Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 70 pp. 047\u2013052, ISSN 0749-0208.\nThe present work concerns cuspate spits: slightly symmetrical geomorphic features growing along the shoreline in shallow waters. We develop a new formulation for the dynamics of cuspate spits. Our approach relies on classical paradigms such as a conservation law to the shoreface scale and an explicit formula for alongshore sediment transport. We derive a non-linear diffusion equation and a fully explicit solution for the growth of cuspate spits. From this general expression, we found interesting applications to quantify shoreline dynamics in the presence of cuspate spits. In particular, we point out a simple method for the datation of a cuspate spit given a limited number of input parameters. Furthermore, we develop a method to quantify the mean alongshore diffusivity along a shoreline perturbed by well-defined cuspate spits of known sizes. Finally, we introduce a formal relationship between the geometric characteristics (amplitude, length) of cuspate spits, which reproduce the self-similarity of these geomorphic features.\nKEYWORDS: runup, setup, infragravity swash, coastal geomorphology, sandbar migration, cross shore sediment transport.\nCohn, N., Ruggiero, P., Ortiz, J., D.J. Walstra, 2014. Investigating the role of complex sandbar morphology on nearshore hydrodynamics. In: Green, A.N. and Cooper, J.A.G. (eds.), Proceedings 13th International Coastal Symposium (Durban, South Africa), Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 70, pp. 053\u2013058, ISSN 0749-0208.\nCoastal environments are characterized by complex feedbacks between flow, sediment transport, and morphology, often resulting in the formation of nearshore sandbars. In many locations, such as Hasaki (Japan), the Netherlands, and the Columbia River Littoral Cell (CRLC, USA), these sandbars exhibit a net offshore migration (NOM) cycle whereby these features form in the inner surf zone, migrate seaward and decay offshore on interannual cycles. Depending on the stage of the cycle, the number and configuration of the bars may differ widely. It has long been recognized that sandbars act as natural barriers during storm events by dissipating wave energy through breaking far from the beach face. Thus, dependent on the stage of the NOM cycle, one might expect significant variability in nearshore hydrodynamics. Using a non-linear wave model we demonstrate that inter-annual variability in sandbar configuration can significantly alter inner surf zone and swash zone processes. The model indicates that under different end-member NOM stages the same wave conditions can result in up to a 36% variance in the vertical extent of infragravity runup and can alter both the rate and direction of net cross shore sediment transport.\nKEYWORDS: volumetric cliff changes, airborne laser scanning, Storm surges, coastal erosion.\nKEYWORDS: rips, headland, current circulation, XBeach, offshore transport.\nAb Razak, M.S., Dastgheib, A., Suryadi, F.X., Roelvink, D. 2014.

Hence biologists, chemists and other sorts of micro-scientists can work on a tiny scale without having to touch particles physically or separate them chemically.\nBut what's more, if it works for small things, there's a good chance that it can be expanded in scale in the future, allowing you to beam your kids off the electricity pylons into a babypen or pull your pint of beer across the table rather than to reach out for it. Think of the possibilities!\nThe boffins come from St Andrews University in Scotland and reckon the beam can be used for driving motors or small rotating parts of machinery. Something that will become more useful as we make use of micro-technology (have you seen the pic of the tiny propeller submarine inside a human vein?). It may also increase efficiency of machines as there won't be frictional effects of brushes, commutators etc on the motor itself.\nThe system works by using two laser beams and setting up an interference pattern. The beams refract on hitting an object, causing that object to move into the brightest part of the beam.

        "passage": " You say, \"I'm angry.\" You don't want to do this. You don't want to do this.\" You don't get emotional. You look at it one step away. \"Just looking\" is the premise of \"Don't. But you can see that it's very difficult to practice. Just accept everything without judging whether it's good or bad. Then I realized that there was nothing very good and nothing bad in the world. I'm also practicing this process, and every minute I realize how much value I make, how many prejudices I have. In his mindfulness, he said, \"Just look at it\" is important. He said, \"If you get angry, just look at it.\" Emotions are something that we can't control and just come and go as water flows. So you don't have to be carried away by that feeling. I've been meditating on my own with an app called \"Viewing Your Mind\" and this month, I participated in an offline meeting called \"gPause\" for the first time. GPause was created by Chad Meng Tan, Google's 107th engineer, who dreamed of greater value when Google went public in 2003 and made enough money to live with his children at an early age, and that was the value of world peace. As a first step toward world peace, we developed a meditation program for Google employees, and that's how we got into our country. gPause is usually held at Google Campus near Samsung Station on the second Tuesday of every month. Applications can be made through onoffmix.com and participation is free of charge. It's basically a meditation club for entrepreneurs, so you can meet a lot of people who start their own businesses. If you don't know how to meditate, it'd be good to visit and take a look.\nIt's like a company life.\nIt's like a company life. Did everyone say that? I'm looking at some of those twinkling stars, and I'm looking at some of them. My anger is part of it, part of it, part of it. It's like that, but there's nothing we can do about it. Oh, that's nothing.\nWhat kind of person do you want to be remembered for?\nThere are some movies based on the original novel, but none are based on the original film.\nWhen I travel, I take a lot of pictures to make my memories. Photographs definitely bring back the senses, but I learned by blogging that pictures alone do not preserve memories for a long. The scrupulous writing on the bottom of the picture makes the taste, mood and feeling of the time much stronger. On the contrary, it reminds us of things that we didn't remember. Writing is a time-consuming task. So you need a will to write. I remember the last time I went on a trip, I made up my mind to finish today's record before it passed, and I tried to put up with the sleepy. The reason why I decided to finish the record by the end of the day is because I wanted to have time to enjoy tomorrow in full because I have experience tomorrow. These days, however, we seem to communicate through video rather than writing. Images are more stimulating and accessible than text. In a word, I can see more. It's fun to see images of various materials, but I think it's clear that there's an even more organized and compressed appeal. Just as various videos are uploaded on YouTube, I sometimes wish it was an era when various writings are uploaded. While I was thinking about it, I was very pleased that the Publicity was the place I wanted to be. Publicity is a system that only allows users to post their writings with video or pictures so far, so if they want to receive many \"thanks\" or drawings, they need to have eye-catching pictures or videos. I don't think it's a place where people can communicate by writing. It may be an idea that runs counter to the times, but I hope you can express yourself through writing or communicate with only writing. So, you will have a culture that stimulates your imagination. There are some movies based on the original novel, but none are based on the original film. I'm going to upload some pictures, but I just post my favorite pictures.\nSamcheok, Gangwon Province donghae, see the ocean, What do you think?\nThe color of the sea in Korea is so pretty. It's still a nice day to go to the winter sea. What do you think of when you see the sea? In the past, I felt like the sea was going to hold everything, and my mind was getting bigger. From some point on, I felt like I was going to be able to see the end of the ocean and I couldn't see the end of it. I thought that people who grew up in a sea-viewed area and those who didn't might have a different emotional or psychological state. Someday, I want to live in a place where the sea is visible.\n'hanwoo seolleongtang' is a popular restaurant in 100,000 cities.\nGangwon Province that about 100,000 people, has a population of donghae. Compared to Seoul, there is a restaurant where people eat in line. It's 'hanwoo seolleongtang.' It's delicious from the start of operation. From 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., we don't have any evening business, and packaging is available after 2 p.m. And if you don't have business on Sunday and want to go here on the weekend, you can only have Saturday lunch. There are only two delicious dishes. seolleongtang and ojoktang According to my friend, seolleongtang is more delicious. 10,000 won may be thought to be a little expensive, but there are lots of meat and lots of sheep. Unlike any other seolleongtang, the soup with the right liver is impressive. According to Sledge, he tried to recruit this place from Starfield, but failed... I don't know if it's true, but it's a popular flavor.\nMy way to work is relatively quiet.\nMy way to work is relatively quiet. The subway station is not crowded and most people go to work in the opposite direction, so there is always a place to sit in the subway. That's why you can 'comparably easily' protect public morals that you get down first and later on. After taking the subway, take the village bus. I might miss the village bus, but I never run. This is because the village bus circulates in three to five minutes as if it were a subway. Every time I take a village bus, the long line is impressive. Most people come to work at the same time, and people who run buses will also adjust the distance between trains to avoid being pushed back in that time. Looking at the neat lines, it suddenly occurred to me that line-up was one of the things that grew bigger and less. Why do we line up? The reason why I line up is because I believe that if I wait in turn, my turn will come. That's why I don't do the cutting-edge. If standing in line is nothing but caring for others, I will not stand in line. You start pushing back and forth, you cut in next to each other, and then you get into And that's a matter of course. If you wait still, the bus will only leave every time. It is guaranteed to be mine if you wait. That is the basis for maintaining order. In the world, the chicken comes first. There are many problems such as \"Is an egg first?\" Do you make order, or do you make room? I think my leisurely work environment has created order this time. The reason why I'm relaxed at work is actually that. The fact that the majority of them are heading in the opposite direction from the direction they go.It would be nice if we had a society where our destinations are different from each other. So it would be good for a society that doesn't care about others, doesn't push others, and doesn't have to bump into others. Photo information, Bali. That was my way to work...\nGuess what! What is this?\nThe universe, the universe I love.\n\"Happy New Year.\" It's a good word to hear a few times. There are two cleaning ladies I know. One is in the company and one is in the apartment where I live in. If there is something in common between you two, it's very noble and very kind. Oh, it's best to be diligent. Let's fix them both. She always makes her makeup look nice and she's holding a cleaning tool. A person in the company sometimes encounters dressing up in the bathroom. It seems that the time of work is around 3-4 p.m. unlike the average office worker, when you see him dressed up, you can imagine that his true life begins after work, as any office worker. Sure, one day is divided into hours at work and hours at work. The reason why the lady's good looks came to me meaningfully is that they are kind to me. Say hello to me, who is often told that I don't like to greet you because I don't have good looks, and I thank you for that.  It's neither a timely nor me, but I'd like to talk about it. I feel good. In fact, the job of cleaning lady is going to be tough. You have to come out of the morning to clean your house before you go to work, and as you can see, your job is to do things that are repeated. But they are bright. I can feel that there is a bright energy. (Of course, there are"

Since then, most authorities and social organizations were integrated, but yurim organization( Confucian scholarship) remained separated for more than ten years. Since it had no central body, yurim was excluded from many cultural activities and faced a lot of difficulties. In order to deal with those problems, eight Confucian scholars came together to create Donghae Hyanggyo as the center of yurim organizations of the region in April 1990.\nThe establishment of Donghae Hyanggyo was authorized by the head of Seonggyun-gwan, the national Confucian academy in February 1994.\nThe foundational committee of Donghae Hyanggyo was launched on September 11th, 1993, and Donghae branch of Youdohoe, a Confucian community organization was created on the same day. Education director of Donghae-si donated land in 254-1, Bugok-dong, where main hall and annex buildings were built. The first head of Donghae Hyanggyo was Han Seo-u.\nNine Confucian scholars are enshrined in the eastern part, and nine others in the western part.\n39 ritual tables in memory of great Confucian scholars of the past and extra tables for other functions were prepared in March 1995. With the devotion and financial commitment of memorial service hosts and donators, the construction of Hyanggyo was completed on 29th June of the same year.

One that SuperMan and Big Girl devoured. Little Bit is not much for casseroles, so she tasted it and stuck to her usual choice of cereal (when dinner is not to her liking, that is) but we all enjoyed the new menu item.\nI hope you give it a try.

If these obligations are not met or otherwise neglected, the employers and property owners can be held liable for any resulting injuries.\n The mildest form is known as a concussion. National Football League (NFL) players often suffer concussions from repeated collisions to the head, with many being medically sidelined for two weeks or more as symptoms are monitored.\nIf you strike your head on a surface after a fall, you may run the risk of suffering a potential traumatic brain injury, just like many NFL players do. However, if the symptoms persist, you may be facing something more than just a concussion. In any case, immediate medical evaluation and treatment is necessary.\nAbility to think and remember things clearly. You may find it difficult to think clearly or remember new information, or you may even feel slowed down or unable to fully concentrate.\nPhysical symptoms. You may experience headaches, fuzzy or blurred vision, dizziness, balance problems, and even nausea and vomiting.\nEmotional symptoms and mood swings. Your mood may become sadder or more irritable, and you may feel more anxiety or nervousness.\nChanges in sleep patterns. You may have trouble sleeping and finding yourself sleeping less, or you may even sleep more.\nSome of these symptoms may appear right away, while others may take weeks or even months to surface. If you feel any of these symptoms after a fall, it\u2019s important that you seek immediate medical attention. Go to the hospital\u2019s emergency department immediately. In some cases, a blood clot that crowds the brain can develop, and this can be extremely dangerous.\nTreatment often involves rest, medication, and potentially even surgery to remove pressure on the brain. During your recovery, you can suffer from lost wages and run up huge medical expenses, all of which can form the basis for a personal injury claim.\nAsk for help: Don\u2019t shrug the incident off and just walk away. Instead, stay put and seek assistance.\nSeek medical attention: You need to get a full medical examination as quickly as possible, even if you\u2019re feeling little or no pain. Don\u2019t wait for symptoms to arise, as this could make treatment more urgent or difficult.\nDocument everything: If possible, take photos of the scene and gather witness contact information so they can provide their account of the incident. When you get a chance, write everything down as you remember it. And be sure to keep copies of all medical records.\nReport the incident: If you\u2019re at work, you need to notify your employer of the incident in order to trigger a workers\u2019 compensation claim. If you\u2019re on non-work property, obtain the owner\u2019s contact information and the insurance company\u2019s name if possible.\nExert your legal rights: Contact a personal injury attorney as soon as possible so you can begin to explore and exercise all of your legal rights.\nIn Texas, injuries sustained on another person\u2019s property fall under what is called premises liability law, which places a \u201cduty of care\u201d responsibility on the property owner to maintain a safe and hazard-free environment. At the same time, however, someone injured on another\u2019s property must prove that the owner knew or should have known of the hazardous condition that caused the incident, and then neglected to do anything about it. This places a rather high burden on the claimant in a personal injury insurance claim or lawsuit.\nWhen it comes to traumatic brain injury, a TBI can sometimes be harder to prove to an insurance company than a spine or bone injury, as these injuries can be shown on an MRI or X-ray. This can be another challenge you and your attorney might have to face.\nTo navigate these legal hurdles, you need the help of an experienced Texas personal injury attorney. You also face a two-year window, known as a statute of limitations, to file your injury claim, so you want to exercise your legal rights as soon as possible and not wait until symptoms become severe or unbearable.\nAs an experienced personal injury attorney, I have been representing clients in Houston and Harris County for over three decades. I know the ins and outs of negotiating with insurance adjusters. I will help you explore all of your legal options and work to develop the best possible legal strategy aimed at helping you get the justice you deserve, even if it involves a lawsuit.

That will probably make you less comfortable, not more. If you\u2019re running your AC fan 24/7, you should probably stop. You\u2019ll usually feel cooler if you let the fan turn off between cooling cycles.\nTo do this, it\u2019s important to know ceiling fans don\u2019t cool rooms; they cool your skin through a wind-chill effect. If you leave a ceiling fan on while you\u2019re gone for an extended period of time, it won\u2019t change the temperature of the room; it only wastes electricity.\nCeiling fans are very large and can be quite loud. They are often found in kitchens, bedrooms, and living rooms. Their size is one aspect that interior designers find ugly, but the brightness of the light fixture is also a major problem.\nEnergy Costs of Fans Fans, in general, do not consume a lot of energy. \u2026 Over time, however, using a DC fan saves you money. A contemporary DC fan typically costs less than a penny per hour to run at its highest speed. Leaving such a fan on high speed 24 hours a day for a month costs about five dollars.\n1) Because fans and light fixtures are normally located near the ceiling, they can be exposed to more direct flames than other items in the room, so it\u2019s not uncommon to see them substantially burned by a fire. \u2026 2) Ceiling fans are usually installed through the protective layer of drywall which forms the ceiling.\nHow Long Should AC Run Before Shutting Off?\nQuick Answer: Should Thermostat Be In Hallway?\nQuick Answer: Can I Use A Meat Thermometer For Oil?<|endoftext|>Code of the West Equestrians is here to help you and your family have a great horse experience!

Also, those gridlines and the shape of Ulleungdo make me wonder how Seoul National University dated THIS MAP, which is believed to have been made sometime between 1750 and 1768.\nMaybe, someone should go back and reevaluate some of these maps?\nActually, this map is a little confusing for me since the name \u8d8a\u677e (Weolsong) comes just before \u9b31\u9675\u5cf6\u9577 (Ulleungdo-Jang) on the map, which suggests that the Ulleungdo-Jang was from Weolsong. If that is true, then the map should be dated from 1888 to 1894.\nI am not exactly sure how to interpret all the writing, so I think more study is needed.\nI especially interested in the \"1859-65.19C\u4e2d\u671f\u3000\u6771\u8f3f\u3000\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6 \uff08\u5199\u672c\uff09\" which Korean National Central Museum (\u97d3\u56fd\u56fd\u7acb\u4e2d\u592e\u535a\u7269\u9928) owns.\nIt also has gridline but the picture is somewhat blurred.\nTha map was made in Japan but the information was brought by Kim Okgyun (\u91d1\u7389\u5747, \uae40\uc625\uade0), the Korean reformist. The map showed the Argonaut island as Takeshima and Ullengdo (Dagelet) as Matsushima. There is no mentioning of Liancourt rocks. So this map means that one of the intellectual Koreans in those days who once worked in Ulleungdo didn't know about Liancourt rocks.\nKim Ok-gyun was not only a Korean intellectual; he was the man in charge of moving settlers to Ulleungdo until he had to flee Korea in 1884, which means he should have known better than anyone the situation on Ulleungdo in 1884. And since his map did not show Liancourt Rocks, we can assume that he either did not know of the rocks or did not consider them to be a part of Korean territory.\nYes, I read Aki's post, which was very good.\nFor example, the 1865 map which was made in Paris indicated Ousan precisely just next to Ulleungdo.\nI saw some German-made maps of Korea which were made in 1892, 1894 & 1897.\nAll these maps are very accurate, as they show Ulleungdo as \"Matsushima (Dagelet I.)\" and Liancourt rocks as \"Liancourt Rocks (Hornet rocks)\", and they don't include the ghost island of Argonaut.\nAdditionally, all these maps coloured both \"Matsushima (Dagelet I)\" and \"Liancourt rocks (Hornet rocks)\" as the same colour as Japan.\nIt seems that western countries in those days recognised as Ulleungdo as Japanese territory, although this was not true, but which may mean that there is no chance for Korea to claim that Liancourt rocks to be their territory.\nP.S. I got a few of these maps from e-Bay recently.\nInteresting maps, Pacifist. I have bookmarked that page.\nI think we have already talked about one of the maps HERE.\nBy the way, did you see the maps on the link that Kaneganese told us about HERE?\nYes, I saw some of the maps in the site (of Alabama Univ) and noticed that although American maps usually conveyed Argonaut I (as Take I.) until early 20th century (1902-1903), German maps (printed in Leipzig) excluded Argonaut I even in 1890's.\nP.S. Some maps can be seen too in the following Texas site, although not so many.\nTo follow is American-made map of Korea. It doesn't include Liancourt rocks, although it includes Ulleungdo.\n\"I am not exactly sure how to interpret all the writing, so I think more study is needed.\"\nI couldn't really understand what you are trying to say\u3000(Sorry...), but if you are not so sure about the year when the map was made right now, maybe the title sould be written as \"1884 - 1888?.... \" in order to avoid any confusion for the readers at least until you become sure about it? I think it would be more friendly to the readers. Not everyone read comment section. But posting your ideas and findings itself is great since it would give us a chance to study more about the map, and hopefully, someone gives us more information about it.\nGood idea, Kaneganese, but I think I will put \"1884 - 1994\" without a question mark since I am pretty sure of that date.\nAnyway, what I was trying to say was that if the \"Ulleungdo-Jang\" (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6\u9577) was the \"Manho\" (\u842c\u6236) out of Weolsong-jin (\u8d8a\u677e\u93ad), then that would mean the map could be dated between 1888 and 1895 since that was the time the Weolsong-jin Manho was Ulleungdo-Jang.\nBetween 1884 and 1888, the Camp Commander at Samcheok replaced the Ulleungdo-Jang, but was called \"Ulleungdo Cheomsa,\" instead.\nIf you look at the writing on the map, you will see that \"Weolsong\" (\u8d8a\u677e) is written just before, which would suggest he was out of Weolsong, but in small letters next to \"Ulleungdo-Jang\" (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6\u9577) is written \"Pyeonghae, Samcheok-po Jin\" (\u5e73\u6d77\u4e09\u4e09\u965f\u6d66\u93ad), which suggests he was out of Samcheok-po Jin. Do you see my confusion now?\nThe fact that Ulleungdo appeared on the Samcheok map makes me believe that the map was made when the Ulleungdo-Jang was the Samcheok commander, which was between 1884 and 1888. The only problem with that is that he was not called \"Ulleungdo-Jang,\" but was called \"Ulleungdo Cheomsa.\" However, I am thinking that \"Ulleungdo-Jang\" could have been his unofficial title since he replace the previous Ulleungdo-Jang.\nYes, I know it is a little confusing.\nAt any rate, I think we can safely say the map was made between 1884 and 1894. I stopped it at 1894, instead of 1895, because that was the upper limit for the map given by Koryo University, who probably had a good reason for dating it up to 1894.\nSo, I think this means this was the last Korean map of Ulleungdo made before the 1900 Imperial Edict that made Ulleungdo and her neighboring islands a county of Gangwon Province. Of course, it is possible that U Yong-jeong (\u79b9\u7528\u9f0e) made a map of Ulleungdo that we do not know about since he inspected the island in 1900, before the edict was proclaimed.\nI got it finally. Besides, as long as \"\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6\u9577\" is listed, it is highly unlikely to be made 1700's, in the first place, right?\n\"I think I will put \"1884 - 1994\" without a question mark since I am pretty sure of that date.\"\nYou mean \"1884 - 1894\"? As long as you are sure about it, yes, it's good. Anyway, good find, Gerry. By the way, isn't it possible to send some question to Koryo University to ask how they defined the year of the map was made, like Shimane prefecture site?\nI'm not sure if this non-official map has anything to do with 1900 Imperial Edict or not, but the text on the map does include some new information on Usando and Ulleungdo, so it is a very important for us. I really hope Korean make all the documents \u79b9\u7528\u9f0e supposed to submit to Korean government public.\nYes, I meant 1884 to 1894. Sorry.\nIf Koryo University dated the map between 1835 and 1894, then that means they do not know the date of the map.\nKorean maps are usually dated by the name change of some village or mountain that is recorded in Korean records. If the map reflects that change, or does not reflect it, then scholars can use that to narrow down the date of Korean maps. In the case of this map, the person looking at it obviously overlooked the mention of \"Ulleungdo-Jang\" (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6\u9577) because that is a clear indicator that the map was made after 1883.\nI guess there is someone at Koryo University who may know about this map, but I think we now know more about it than he or she does. Even the Dokdo Museum could only date"

In particular, we focus on the notion of optimal modularity, that predicts the occurrence of global cascades when the network exhibits just the right amount of modularity. Here we generalize the findings by assuming the presence of multiple communities and an uniform distribution of seeds across the network. Finally, we offer some insights into the temporal evolution of cascades in the regime of the optimal modularity.\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe previous chapter reviewed the message-passing (MP) framework that can accurately describe the dynamics of spreading processes, and in particular that exhibited by the Watts threshold model [1,2,3]. In this chapter, we leverage the framework to study how complex contagions are affected by the modular structure of the underlying social network. In particular, we focus on the notion of optimal modularity, that predicts the occurrence of global cascades when the network exhibits just the right amount of modularity [4].\nModular organization, or community structure, is one of the most ubiquitous properties of real-world networks [5,6] and therefore it is crucial to understand how information diffusion is affected by a modular structure. Addressing this problem is particularly urgent when one considers spreading phenomena characterized by complex contagion. Unlike the case of simple contagion, where modules simply slow down the spreading, complex contagion may be either enhanced or hampered by modular structure [7,8]. In contrast to simple, complex contagion requires multiple exposures and those are favored within densely connected communities. At the same time, complex contagion can be strongly hampered at the boundaries of communities due to the lack of the sufficient connectivity needed to provide the required multiple exposures from the activated community to the yet-to-be-activated one. The counter-intuitive phenomenon of optimal modularity arises from the clash and compromise between these opposite tendencies.\nThe basic setting for our study is as follows. We assume a network of individuals where an individual can be in either an \"active\" or \"inactive\" state. At each time step, an inactive node may become active if the node is surrounded by enough active nodes. The activation condition is captured in a threshold function C (m, k) that typically depends on the degree k of a node, and the number m of its active neighbors.\nHere we consider C (m, k) = H( m k \u2212 \u03b8 ), where H(x) is a Heaviside step function and \u03b8 is a threshold value. Throughout this chapter we assume that \u03b8 is constant across the network. Our analysis leverages the framework introduced in the previous chapter. We focus our analysis only on the ensembles of random networks with arbitrary degree distribution [9], and \"message-passing\" (MP) and \"Tree-Like\" (TL) are used interchangeably throughout our chapter.\n2 Analytical framework 2.1 Mean-field and message-passing approaches for configuration model As explained in the previous chapter, the steady-state fraction of active nodes \u03c1 \u221e can be estimated using Mean-Field (MF) or the Message-Passing (MP) approaches.\nAssuming an underlying infinite networks with a given degree distribution p k but otherwise random, \u03c1 \u221e can be obtained by solving the following self-consistent equations. Using the MF approach, where \u03c1 0 is the initial fraction of seeds. This approach does not aim at describing the evolution from one time step to the other, rather it states that at stationarity, the density of active nodes is the sum of two contributions: the fraction of seed nodes and expected number of nodes that have an above-the-threshold fraction of active neighbors. This last contribution, in turn, is expressed in terms of the degree distribution and of the density of active nodes itself. The MP (TL) approach assumes that the underlying network is well approximated by a tree structure. To the extent to which such approximation is valid, where each node is affected only by its children. The density of active nodes depends only from the level of the tree where the node is, which is described by the following formula: where q n is the density of active nodes at the n-th level of the tree (q 0 = \u03c1 0 ). Note that excess degree distribution is used in the place of degree distribution because each node uses one of its link to connect to its parent and only children nodes affect the status of the node. The final density can be calculated by focusing the root node: where q \u221e = lim n\u2192\u221e q n. See the previous chapter for more details.\n\nGeneralization to modular networks\nThe MP framework can be readily generalized to modular networks by introducing density-of-active variables for each community [3]. Consider a network with d communities, where the connection probabilities between communities are stored in a d \u00d7 d mixing matrix e. Here e i j is the probability that a random edge connects community i and j. Consider a node in community i and at the n + 1 level of the spreading tree. The probability to pick one of its active children (n-th level) can be written as: Eq. 2 can be extended to describe the relation between the densities in different communitites [3]. where k is the mean degree of community i. This set of equations can be solved by iteration analogously to Eq. 3. The density of active nodes at stationarity is: See [3] for more details.\n\nNetworks with two communities\nHaving set up the necessary tool, we now turn into investigating on how the strength of the modular structure can affect the spreading of complex contagion. The simplest setting one may consider is a network with two equally sized communities. Given a fixed and predefined number L of links in the network, we first randomly connect \u00b5L couple of nodes, where each member of the couple sits in a different community. The remaining links are then used to randomly connect couple of nodes in the same community [5]. If \u00b5 = 0, no edge is placed between the two communities (the network has two components and is therefore maximally modular); if \u00b5 = 0.5, the network is an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random graph in the infinite size limit. A fraction \u03c1 0 of active nodes are set in one of the two communities, which we call \"seed community\". As shown in [4] and illustrated in Fig. 1, the density of active nodes at stationarity \u03c1 \u221e depends non-trivially on the degree of inter-community connectivity, showing a maximum at intermediate values of \u00b5.\nSmall values of \u00b5 allow initial spreading in the seed community, but it is essential to have enough mixing (bridges) between communities to have a cascade that significantly interests the global community. At the same time, when too many links across community are present, since these occur at the expense of the intracommunity links, there is insufficient connectivity in the seed community to trigger the initial diffusion of the activation. We name optimal modularity the range of \u00b5 values for which the two mechanisms above find their trade-off to maximize the size of the cascade.\n\nOptimal modularity in networks with many communities\nA network with just two equally sized communities with all the seed users concentrated in one of those is an obvious starting point for this study, but, in general, a nonrealistic assumption. We generalize our finding by first considering multiple communities of the same size and with the same degree of intra and inter-connectivity. We then consider a more general process to generate the network and its modular structure. We consider the family of graphs known as LFR (Lancichinetti-Fortun"

        "passage": " 2018 there was just one \u2014 the case in which seven people were reportedly drugged at the former Sigma Chi house.\nReports of druggings result in mandatory alerts to the community under the Jeanne Clery Act. The Daily looked into how exactly these AlertSUs work in order to answer common questions about AlertSUs and druggings, including whether any procedure or law has changed this fall to explain the wave of drugging reports.\nThe wave of reports began on Oct. 12, when a female student who lost consciousness after drinking at a party on the Row tested positive for gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) \u2014 a dangerous sedative and common date-rape drug. Since then, there has been a steady trickle of reports with no known connection between them. Many of the reported druggings have occurred in student dorms. \nThe reported drugging wave has occurred amid discussions about the AAU campus climate survey released in October, which found that 14.2% of respondents reported experiencing at least one incident of nonconsensual sexual contact since entering Stanford.\nThe drugging reports sent out to the community come from SUDPS, which is often tipped by Campus Security Authorities (CSAs), individuals designated as mandatory reporters to local law enforcement for crimes like aggravated assault. Larson told The Daily that SUDPS does not have evidence confirming anyone has been drugged this year, and that the department has received very little identifying information in reports of these crimes.\nWhen gathering evidence and releasing information to the public, SUDPS balances the wishes of alleged victims with maintaining the safety of the greater community, Larson wrote. California law and the Clery Act require that Stanford notify the community of any \u201cincident that is thought to pose an immediate or ongoing threat to the health or safety of those on campus,\u201d he added.\nOnce a \u201cClery-reportable crime believed to present an ongoing threat to the community\u201d has been reported to Stanford law enforcement, a University official sends an AlertSU to the community. All drugging AlertSUs have been timely warnings, as opposed to emergency notifications, with the former being used for crimes and ongoing threats while the latter is reserved for disasters and major dangers at the discretion of the University. Secretly drugging or poisoning someone is classified in California as aggravated assault, making it Clery-reportable per the Stanford Security and Fire Report.\nIn his statement to The Daily, Larson did not provide a theory about the cause of the spike in drugging reports, but he did say that the recent series of drugging reports is exceptional and concerning.\nBrubaker-Cole\u2019s statement went into depth into how the University immediately responds to evidence or reports of druggings.\nSimilar waves of Clery-reportable crimes have occurred in the past, such as the spike in graffiti hate crimes in 2017 and the wave of catalytic converter robberies this summer and autumn. This wave is different, however, in that the individual cases do not seem to be linked.\nWhen The Daily asked Brubaker-Cole what she thought had caused the recent spike in drugging reports, Student Affairs spokesperson Pat Harris referenced Brubaker Cole\u2019s previous public statements to the community.\nBrubaker-Cole has also produced a video with more information on recent student security concerns.\nCooper Veit '22 is an opinions writer and amateur Steinbeck scholar from San Francisco.

How could you not be engaged by this story?\nThe day my water breaks, with my first pregnancy, I was 23.0 weeks pregnant. The experiment begins as soon as I am admitted. I was told that I would go into labor within 24 hours. When that didn't happen a neonatologist came into my room to tell my husband and I that our daughter will never be normal if she is born before 26 weeks and that she would most definitely have disabilities. He told us that we should just hold her and let her die in our arms. He was even willing to make sure our wishes would be carried out in the delivery room.\nWhen we refused to give up, I was moved to another hospital with a NICU that was able to care for micropreemies.\nThe experiment received their next participant the day our daughter was born-at 25.5 weeks, weighing in at 1 pound 12 ounces and 13 inches long. Post natal steroids for her-not being sure on the dosage-they just guess (based on past participants). So many tests for her lead to many blood transfusions. X-rays, ultrasounds, exams... all part of the experiment. Central lines, TPN, IV's-all without any pain meds. Is this humane? Alarms blare, phones ring, people talk loudly around the babies. All part of the experiment.\nThat was 8 years ago. She walks, she talks, she is advanced in some areas of school. She is beautiful. Hardly an outward sign of her prematurity.\nNot if you ask her.

You can usually find details about such charities on the web and it may be something you may need to look into if you\u2019re in a position to assist a charity.\nTruck Traffic, buses and private transportation was diverted to alternate routes, and the whole lot nonetheless made it, in some way where it needed to go.

Clinton even gave Aaron the Presidential Citizens Medal in 2001, and George W. Bush commended Aaron again a year later with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the highest awards a civilian can receive in this country.\nWhile Aaron did a tremendous amount of work for the civil rights movement, he also focused on the next generation. Aaron paid school fees for children who could not pay the fees themselves, as well as many other ways of giving back to those in need. Aaron had a tough childhood, so young children who were in need always had a special place with him. One of his most recent endeavors was giving scholarships to college students through his Chasing the Dream Foundation. The scholarships were specifically for students who were attending historically black colleges and universities. Aaron spent a lot of time working with the foundation, which had one-part time employee in 2017 and had a budget under $100,000. In 2016, the foundation gave $350,000 in scholarships to students attending 27 different schools, and Aaron assisted Major League Baseball in giving out $2 million in scholarships as well.\nAaron was an incredible man, one who will be greatly missed. Many people have had their lives improved because of him, and the organizations that he worked with will continue to live on and pursue his goal. One of Aaron\u2019s favorite things in his life was helping people, and he had a full lifetime of doing just that. He worked to make the world a better place not just for himself, but for future generations as well. He invested a great amount of resources in future generations, with the hope that they would do the same in the future.

Certain social societies could punish it by keeping records and excluding services or expelling from HOAs and the like, but as for overarching, general enforcement, it\u2019s not practical in a market based system. However, without welfare and the culture that it breeds, abortions would become far less common. It would eventually be a statistically insignificant practice. Also, without state barriers, people could easily prevent abortions by paying the mother to follow through with the birth and adopt the child.<|endoftext|>What's better than one cute necklace? Three!

The series is aimed at foreign expatriates living in Korea. Twice each year, for six-weeks, a series of discussions is held, with attendees participating.\nThe series this spring will focus on changes in Korean society, culture and history from the perspective of Korean women.\nThe five lectures and a a final discussion session vary in their subject material, ranging from women\u2019s health issues to the women\u2019s movement in Korea.\nActivities at the center include research, workshops and conferences on women\u2019s studies, and the publication of various periodicals such as the Asian Journal of Women\u2019s Studies.\nThe spring series runs until May 30, and the lectures are held each Friday from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. at the Asia Womens\u2019 Studies Center\u2019s conference room.

Swimming pools and water parks are an option, but the traffic, crowds and overall unpleasant atmosphere are discouraging, to say the least. But why stand in a line for 30 seconds of splashes when you can escape to a natural remedy?\nYachting, kayaking and rafting are just three ways to go off the beaten path and enjoy your summer without bumping shoulders.\nSunbathing in white linens on a luxurious yacht with a pina colada in-hand and Brad Pitt wearing the captain\u2019s hat - not a bad way to spend a summer afternoon.\nYou don\u2019t need to be a millionaire or sailing in the Caribbean to make this fantasy come true (excluding Brad, perhaps). A number of harbor cities around the country offer different types of yacht tours including Jeju Island; Haeundae in Busan; Jeongok Harbor in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi; and Chungmu Marina in Tongyeong, South Gyeongsang.\nOne of the many charms of spending a day on a yacht tour is that you can enjoy the sea with all your senses.  The sound of the waves crashing comes as the cool breeze slips through your fingers.\nThere are two types of yacht tours: public and private. Busan Bexco\u2019s public yacht tour called Yacht B (www.yachtb.co.kr) offers one-hour tours starting from Gwanganri to Haeundae to Dongbaek Island, along Marine City and back to Gwanganri. During the tour, sea fishing, barbecuing on the yacht and foot baths are all available.\nYacht tours get especially popular during the sunset. To catch the view, you can purchase the tour program that starts at 7 or 8:30 p.m.\nPublic tours cost 60,000 won ($53) for adults and 40,000 won for children. A maximum of 29 people, including the skipper, can board the yacht.\nIf you prefer a private session on a yacht, you can rent the whole boat at each of the above-mentioned cities. It can be a little more costly, but if you are planning on a romantic night, you\u2019d have to try pretty hard to screw it up.\nYou can also try skin-scuba diving, swimming and sea fishing on your own private yacht. It costs 500,000 won per hour to rent.\nCanoeing and kayaking are official water sports in the 2012 London Games, but you don\u2019t have to be an Olympic athlete to row down a river or in the ocean. The popularity of canoeing and kayaking in Korea as a leisure sport has been growing. Once used on the peninsula for travel, it\u2019s not uncommon to see enthusiasts spend the day on a river for fun.\nTransparent canoes and kayaks made entirely of see-through plastic allow rowers to see what\u2019s going on down below, for better or worse. Jangho Village (www.jhbada.com) in Samcheok, Gangwon, was the first to adopt transparent canoes and kayaks in the country just four years ago"

The feature that costs money \u2013 you may not even need!\nIf you are interested in this feature, after you pay for the add-on you\u2019ll get a full detailed report with an estimate for rent that includes the rate for expected vacancies and local comps. I\u2019ve tested out several free property management software options, and Cozy came out on top for a reason!\nYou can see a full report here that shows an example of what the paid feature will get you. The rent estimates are professional, in-depth, and comprehensive. There are other options out there, but they will likely cost more than the Cozy add-on price.\nInviting tenants to use Cozy is actually a lot easier than it may seem. All you\u2019ll need to complete this process is their name and email address. Enter those into Cozy and the software takes care of the rest!\nRenters will then get an email from Cozy that they can use to set up their account and add a payment option. This is where they will see the option to make their rent payment recurring and automatic each month. This helps prevent the possibility of turning in rent late and being charged extra!\nIt takes less than 10 minutes for them to set up their account. They will be shown that if they decide to pay with a credit or debit card that there will be 2.75% fee each time but if they use an ACH transfer, there is no additional fee.\nOne of the newest features to this property management software is the ability to put in maintenance requests. Towards the end of 2017, Cozy added the free feature that helps you and tenants alike.\nThere are two different features: the expensive tracker and maintenance requests. The expense tracker lets you track each rental expense right from the portal. You\u2019ll have the option to assign specific expenses to specific properties. Cozy allows you to add photos of receipts and this feature even helps make taxes easier come time to fill out the rental property tax deduction section!\nWhen it comes to maintenance requests, your renters can use the portal to put in their very own requests. They\u2019ll be able to write in a detailed description of what needs to be fixed, along with any photos they have. You can use this feature to help set up times when both the tenant and the maintenance employee is available.\nCozy keeps track of all maintenance requests and allows you to keep an updated log of when something is fixed, giving you the option to add photos too. If you\u2019re a landlord that doubles as the maintenance employee, you\u2019ll really enjoy this feature!\nIn order for your renters to pay rent online, they need to sign up for an account. In order for you to receive their rent, you need an account as well. When you sign up, you\u2019ll need to provide your bank ID, along with a password. Cozy is incredibly safe and secure, so you don\u2019t have to worry about typing in personal information.\nIf you\u2019re extra cautious, you can use your ACH routing number, along with your bank account number. This is similar to writing a check; you don\u2019t provide any sensitive information! Once you\u2019ve done this, you have two options: configure each property to start accepting potential renter applications or you could set up an already existing lease.\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that a lease on the Cozy software isn\u2019t a legally binding lease, but it does lay out your rules and terms of a lease agreement. You can write in what rent costs per month, per unit, along with the starting and ending dates of the lease, how much of a security deposit was given, and additional fees such as a pet deposit.\nAlright, so you\u2019ve read an in-depth review about what exactly Cozy is and an analysis of the key features that come with it, along with how to sign up yourself and your renters. Have you decided that this sounds like the best property management software for you? If so, I wanted to share a bit about where you can download the software, but first let\u2019s talk about the free demo included.\nIf you click the link given above, you\u2019ll see the next available dates and times for a free demo on how to manage your properties like a pro. You can choose from one of these dates and times and sign up and go from there.\nBelow that, there is the option to check out some of the frequently asked questions that come from the demonstration. This is made for both landlords and tenants and it answers a number of questions. You\u2019ll learn about what goes into the demo, how long it may take, how much it costs, and which devices you can watch the demo on!\nAt the end of every demo, Cozy hosts a live question and answer session so you can get any questions you may have after the demo answered! It\u2019s a great thing to take part in since others may have questions or concerns that apply to you that you haven\u2019t thought of yet!\nNext to the demo FAQ section is the option to watch a free demo video. This is a short video (around 9 minutes) that gives you an intro of what the demo will be like and it goes over a bit of what exactly Cozy can do for you. I suggest checking out all of these options, but if you\u2019re short on time like a true landlord, go with the free demo over the video or FAQ section.\nIf you\u2019re ready to sign up for the software after you\u2019ve taken part in the free demo, you can simply click here to sign up and fill out the information requested. That\u2019s all it takes to get this amazing property management software!\nAt the time of writing this review, there isn\u2019t a Cozy app available for mobile devices. This is something the company could improve on, since it would be incredibly convenient for yourself and your renters.\nWith that being said, their website works perfectly on mobile device browsers. You\u2019ll be able to log in and view any necessary files, or pay rent if you\u2019re a tenant. Hopefully, soon they\u2019ll roll out an awesome mobile app to go with this amazing software!\nIf you\u2019re a landlord or a property owner, you already have a lot on your plate. You have to complete paperwork daily, keep track of everyone\u2019s rent history, give tours of vacant property, tackle any maintenance issues, and more. You\u2019re just one person, and it\u2019s totally okay to get some help from software.\nI was in the same position, which is why I wanted to tell you all about the software that helped me out. After I started using Cozy, I was less stressed and had more time to do the things that I enjoyed in life.\nThis software will help you with tasks like listing properties across the most popular websites, screening potential clients, and keeping track of any important or sensitive information you need to keep organized. Hopefully now you\u2019re a little more convinced on using software that has the potential to make your life so much easier!<|endoftext|>This is a placeholder page for Stephanie Cantrell, which means this person is not currently on this site.

Interesting cast list. Oh, and of course Michael Winterbottom directing from the Matt Greenhalgh script.\nFor those of you who don't know, Paul Raymond became one of the richest people in Britain and was often called the British Hugh Hefner, although that title does present a narrow view of his empire. He was a property tycoon as well as the owner of gentlemen's clubs and adult magazines from Men Only to Mayfair and he did more than just own them, he was closely involved in them in many aspects. He really was at the forefront of the adult industry at the time, especially for the media.\nSo it's a surprise that it has taken so long to make a film about the man but Michael Winterbottom and the unlikely lead in Steve Coogan have done just that, and it's a good film too.\nThe Look of Love is an interesting, enjoyable and at times emotional film but I have to admit that it didn't completely live up to my expectations. I had hoped that it was more about Paul Raymond but it did focus more on his relationship with his daughter, which to be fair is a huge aspect of his story but there was so much more that was touched on and seemed just as interesting.\nI can imagine in trying to adapt the story of such a flamboyant and unusual character as Paul Raymond deciding what to take to the confines of a film would be difficult. As it stands though it is a very good film with a surprising last act and there are some strong performances on the way. A review will be coming very soon.<|endoftext|>The bridge of the golden horn\n\n\"The Bridge of the Golden Horn\" is a coming-of-age novel, a sentimental education that is also a political, cultural and intellectual one.

She leaves Istanbul, works on an assembly line in West Berlin making radios, and lives in a women's factory hostel. But zdamar's novel is not about the problems of assembly line work - it's a witty, picaresque account of a precocious teenager refusing to become wise, of a hectic four years lived between Berlin and Istanbul, of a young woman who is obsessed by theatre, film, poetry and left-wing politics.

One of late Asselian age dominated by Mesogondolella and Streptognathodus and one of Artinskian age dominated by Sweetognathus with Mesogondolella. The Asselian fauna contains the same species as those found in the type area of the Asselian in the southern Urals including Mesogondolella dentiseparata, described for the first time outside of the Urals. Apparatuses for Sweetognathus whitei, Diplognathodus stevensi, and Idioprioniodus sp. are described. The Garden Valley Formation represents a marine pro-delta basin and platform, and marine and shore fan delta complex deposition. The fan-delta complex was most likely deposited from late Artinskian to late Wordian. The Garden Valley Formation records tremendous swings in depositional setting from shallow-water to basin to shore.\nHabitat structural effect on squamata fauna of the restinga ecosystem in northeastern Brazil.\nIn this work, we surveyed data on richness and composition of squamatan reptiles and habitat structural effect in nine areas of restinga ecosystem in the State of Bahia, northeastern Brazil. The \"restinga\" ecosystems are coastal sand dune habitats on the coast of Brazil. Our main hypothesis is that the Squamata fauna composition along these restinga areas would be modulated by habitat structural. After 90 days of field sampling we recorded approximately 5% of reptile species known in Brazil. The composition of Squamata assemblages varied mainly based on the presence or absence of lizards of the genera Ameivula and Tropidurus. Our data showed that habitat structure consistently affected the composition of local Squamata fauna, especially lizards.\nFull Text Available Disturbances such as forest fires, industrial pollution, etc. are almost always heterogeneous, leaving less disturbed patches within the boundaries of disturbances. In addition to the traditionally considered source of soil invertebrates\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 restoration by immigration from the surrounding unchanged biotopes, the role of locally undisturbed areas within the impact zones is shown. The presence of perfugia within the impact areas of various origin is revealed. Perfugia are locally less disturbed or undisturbed areas within a disturbed ecosystem where specimens or remnants of soil biota communities survive a disturbance. They are characterized by higher diversity and abundance of soil fauna in comparison to the main disturbed area. The heterogeneity of soil environment, the heterogeneity of its disturbance and the presence of perfugia serve as one of the factors in the recovery of soil fauna after the disturbances.\nFull Text Available In the present study, insect fauna in forests around Samcheok, Gangwon-do that were designated as regeneration forests, were investigated from August to October in 2012.

The study comprised two different agroforestry systems (AFS-1 and AFS-2, a secondary forest, and a cassava monoculture. We aimed at assessing the effects of land use on the soil fauna and its relationship with soil chemical (pH, Al, Ca, Mg, P, K, carbon, and organic matter and microbiological attributes (soil microbial biomass carbon - SMB-C, soil respiration \u00e2\u20ac\u201c SR, metabolic quotient - qCO2, microbial biomass carbon - C-mic. During winter, AFS-2 showed higher abundance of microphagous, saprophagous, and total individuals than the other areas. AFS-1 and the forest showed an increased abundance of Formicidae and phytophagous groups from winter to summer. The soil fauna and community structure showed that the studied agroforests are under regeneration, becoming more similar to the native forest, where ecological processes are considered efficient.\nThe soil fauna communities were described for three dominant vegetation types in a high arctic site at Zackenberg, Northeast Greenland. Soil samples were extracted to quantify the densities of mites, collembolans, enchytraeids, diptera larvae, nematodes and protozoa. Rates of microbial respiration...... densities (naked amoeba and heterotrophic flagellates) were equal. Respiration rate of unamended soil was similar in soil from the three plots. However, a higher respiration rate increase in carbon + nutrient amended soil and the higher densities of soil fauna (with the exception of mites and protozoa...... were also assessed. Collembolans were found in highest densities in dry heath soil, about 130,000 individuals m-2, more than twice as high as in mesic heath soils. Enchytraeids, diptera larvae and nematodes were also more abundant in the dry heath soil than in mesic heath soils, whereas protozoan...\nFull Text Available The freshwater fish fauna of the Indrayani River, a northern tributary of the Krishna River system in the Western Ghats of India was studied. A total of 57 species of freshwater fish belonging to 18 families and 39 genera were recorded. However, based on the previous literature it is possible that the Indrayani River harbours around 67 species. Out of the 57 species in the present collection, 12 are endemic to the Western Ghats while six are endemic to the Krishna River system. Neotropius khavalchor, an endemic fish of the Krishna River system, was recorded for the first time from the northern tributaries. The fish fauna of the Indrayani River is threatened due to seven introduced species and anthropogenic activities such as deforestation leading to siltation, tourism, sand mining, over fishing and organic and inorganic pollution. Since the Indrayani River hosts endemic and threatened species, including Glyptothorax poonaensis, conservation measures to ensure habitat protection in the river are essential.\nbiogeographical regions in Europe from the Limnofauna Europaea and used multiple regression analyses to test for correlations between the diversity of definitive (vertebrates) or first intermediate (gastropods) hosts and that of trematodes, and for latitudinal gradients in trematode diversity. In particular, we...... faunas. Results Latitude or first intermediate host richness had no effect on trematode richness, but definitive host richness was a strong predictor of trematode richness, among both allogenic and autogenic parasites. We found that beta diversity of trematode faunas within latitudinal bands decreased...... to the north, with similar values for allogenic and autogenic trematodes. Finally, we observed an increasing proportion of autogenic species toward the north of Europe. Main conclusions The richness of definitive hosts appears to be the driver of trematode diversity at a continental scale.

In New Zealand, a shortage of skilled professionals may contribute to or impact on motivation. Using a modified model of Herzberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-factor theory by Smerek and Peterson (2007, this research seeks to answer the question: what motivates New Zealand IT professionals? In response, an online questionnaire was distributed to a population of New Zealand IT professionals and the data analysed using Partial Least Squares to understand the relationship between the various dimensions of job satisfaction, the impact of personal and job characteristics, and turnover intention. The findings show that the New Zealand IT professional is primarily motivated by the nature of his or her work, followed by perceptions of responsibility, and how supervisors encourage an environment for such. Satisfaction with salary is a predictor to a lesser degree. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, professional growth opportunities, career advancement, and recognition do not have a statistically-significant positive association with motivation. We conclude that, to motivate their IT workforce, organizations should: 1 focus on the nature of the jobs that IT professionals undertake; 2 train supervisors to provide an empowering environment; 3 offer competitive salaries to retain top talent; 4 not hesitate to employ IT professionals born outside New Zealand; and 5 take account of the singularities of the New Zealand labour market in seeking to attract, recruit and retain IT professionals. Implications for policy, practice and theory are discussed.\nFull Text Available RESUMO A diferen\u00c3\u00a7a sucessional entre os fragmentos florestais reflete-se na comunidade da fauna do solo, mostrando-se um bioindicador eficiente.

        "passage": " Wall Street, or Federal Reserve\u2019s bailouts.\nThe problem with the Government\u2019s $2 Trillion fiscal stimulus bill is that while it provides one-time payments to taxpayers, which will do little to extinguish the financial hardships and debt defaults they will face.\nMost importantly, as shown below, the majority of businesses will run out of money long before SBA loans, or financial assistance, can be provided. This will lead to higher, and a longer-duration of, unemployment.\nThe wealth gap is going to explode, demands for government assistance will skyrocket, and revenues coming into the government will plunge as trillions in debt issuance must be absorbed by the Federal Reserve.\nWhile the top one-percent of the population will exit the recession relatively unscathed, again, it isn\u2019t the one-percent I am talking about.\nIt\u2019s economic growth.\nIt now requires nearly $3.00 of debt to create $1 of economic growth. This will rise to more than $5.00 by the end of 2020 as debt surges to offset the collapse in economic growth. Another way to view the impact of debt on the economy is to look at what \u201cdebt-free\u201d economic growth would be.\nNotice that for the 30-year period from 1952 to 1982, the economic surplus fostered a rising economic growth rate, which averaged roughly 8% during that period. Since then, the economic deficit has only continued to erode economic prosperity.\nIn 2019, we saw it again in accelerated stock buybacks, low-quality debt issuance, debt-funded dividends, and speculative investments.\nThe debt bubble has now burst.\n\u201cWhen credit creation can no longer be sustained, the markets must clear the excesses before the next cycle can begin. It is only then, and must be allowed to happen, can resources be reallocated back towards more efficient uses. This is why all the efforts of Keynesian policies to stimulate growth in the economy have ultimately failed. Those fiscal and monetary policies, from TARP and QE, to tax cuts, only delay the clearing process. Ultimately, that delay only deepens the process when it begins.\nThis is why the Federal Reserve is throwing the \u201ckitchen sink\u201d at the credit markets to try and forestall the clearing process.\nIf they are unsuccessful, which is a very real possibility, the U.S. will enter into a \u201cGreat Depression\u201d rather than just a \u201csevere recession,\u201d as the system clears trillions in debt.\n\u201cWhile we do have the ability to choose our future path, taking action today would require more economic pain and sacrifice than elected politicians are willing to inflict upon their constituents. This is why throughout the entirety of history, every empire collapsed eventually collapsed under the weight of its debt.<|endoftext|>Concerning fraternities and butt-chuggery.\nMr. Broughton denies each and every allegation, whatsoever, that has been inferred that he may be a gay man. He is a straight man and he thinks that the idea and the concept of butt chugging is absolutely repulsive. \u2014 Lawyer Daniel McGehee defending his client Alex Broughton, a 20-year-old University of Tennessee student and until recently, a proud member of Pi Kappa Alpha, against allegations of \"butt-chugging.\"\nThe University of Tennessee and fraternity organizations across the world have been rocked by the curious case of Alex Broughton.\nOn the night of Sept. 21, during a Pi Kappa Alpha party, Broughton was rushed to the hospital with an acute case of alcohol poisoning. After a thorough investigation into the night's events and after what apparently was a much more thorough investigation into Broughton, the university suspended Pi Kappa Alpha's charter because of what officials believed was a violation of anti-hazing policies.\nThe unofficial charge?\nIn short (we pray), butt-chugging is the act of using tubing to ingest alcohol into one's rectum. The supposed benefit is that the alcohol bypasses the liver and enters the bloodstream through the mucus membranes in one's butt, delivering a quicker drunk. \nBroughton's plight \u2014 especially his adamant denial of gay accusations \u2014 is like a scene straight out of \"Animal House.\" But I am not here to poke fun.\nPoking guys is so \u2026 Broughton.\nNow let me continue.\nWhile I understand that most people use this column merely for hamster-cage lining, to cover picnic tables before picking through bushels of steamed blue crabs or as a cheap alternative for toilet paper, I've also been told that some people actually read it. I would guess that many \u2014 tens \u2014 of these people attended college too. Some of them may have even been in a fraternity.\nYou see, I myself was the member of a fraternity in college. In fact, I was briefly the president of my fraternity.\nThe media, close-minded bigots, people who never got bids to become our frat bros and other anti-fraternity group bros have always propagated lies against our system. Accusing us of hazing, of misogyny, of cheating, of favoritism, of elitism, of \"gayness,\" and if discussing a frat from the Southeastern Conference, total racism.\nNow, in this final and most blasphemous act of falsification \u2014 charges of butt-chuggery.\nMy people always have been much-maligned, and this portrayal of our system brings back memories of a time when I was unjustly persecuted and unfairly removed from my fraternity over bogus allegations.\nAs fraternity president I was in charge of our finances and more importantly, the \"executor\" of the bank account and sole owner of our fraternity charge card.\nI say this with a misty eye and a heavy heart, but two months into my tenure I was \"accused\" and technically \"caught\" running up various bar tabs for myself, taking girls on dates, purchasing a new alternator for my Ford Taurus and renting strippers for a fraternity function in lieu of paying our yearly fraternity insurance premiums, all on the fraternity dime. Obviously these were expenditures that took precedence and could not be avoided.\nForced to step down after word of my alleged \"transgressions\" came to light, my life was left in shambles. Shamed on campus and in our small college town, I was forced to graduate with a bachelor of arts degree shortly thereafter and look for work in the real world.\nI too know the slings and arrows of injustice.\nBroughton may or may not have been forced to butt-chug. Hell, he may have willingly butt-chugged. But Broughton broke no laws. \nSo before you go around blaming fraternities for the ills of the world and butt-chugging, I implore you to take a look at yourself. Are we really that different? Is anyone really better than anyone else in this hardscrabble world?\nNow ask yourself this: Have you in a moment of weakness not at least considered the rectal consumption of an entire box of Franzia?\nA little deeper.\nOK, that's deep enough.<|endoftext|>Anavar (oxandrolone) is not very dangerous, not very androgenic, slightly anabolic, and very moderate on the bodys HPTA (Hypothalamic-Testicular-Pituitary-Axis).

It still has some of that Ride dampness built into it.\nBase glide was pretty good but nothing exceptional and I didn\u2019t feel the Algorhythm had any better glide to it.\nSo I thought this mellow camber wouldn\u2019t tickle my taint but it sure did. I had a great time turning with the Ride Shadowban. There is a sidecut that is deep but it starts out shallow and then transitions into a really deep sidecut so it doesn\u2019t fight you if you want more down the line turns closer to a straight line. If you want to circle or across the groomer carve it will accommodate you as well. I had a good time with the overall turning experience.\nSo what is cool about the Ride Shadowban is how much directional float you can get from this shape. If you set it all the way back at a 22.75\u201d stance width you can get 2.25\u201d back from center of board. I couldn\u2019t set it all the way back with a 21.5\u201d stance width but I still felt a lot of float sliding it all the way back on the front with my Union Atlas and as far back as I could on the back binding. I might have even stretched out my stance width to 22\u201d to get a little more float. In the good spring powder I had I was impressed and it felt more directional than you would think when set back like this.\nWhen on reference and ducked out, the Ride Shadowban did a great job riding switch and I had a time flipping it around. I liked it in the pipe too. Very competent grip and a great board to drive wall to wall in the pipe. It\u2019s also great for making quick adjustments when you get off your game as I often do there. Jumps are great with this. If you go really big maybe go with the Algorhythm but if you are medium which is more than most the Shadowban will be fine. Not the first board I\u2019d want to jib with.\nWe try to get as many images of the Ride Shadowban, but forgive us if they're not all there.<|endoftext|>Seoul, May 23 (IANS) South Korea will resume an annual field training program for its reserve forces in a scaled-back manner next month after a two-years Covid-triggered hiatus, the state military recruitment agency said on Monday.\nStarting from June 20, some 500,000 reservists will be called upon to complete the programme, consisting of field drills and an online session lasting eight hours each, according to the Military Manpower Administration.\nIn the pre-pandemic era, most reservists were required to engage in three days of on-site training at nearby military bases, reports Yonhap News Agency.\nThe administration said reservists in Uljin, Samcheok, Gangneung and Donghae, designated as special disaster zones reeling from the aftermath of wildfires in March, are exempt from the training.\nIt added it will prepare strict anti-virus measures, considering the Covid-19 pandemic is yet to end.\nThe reservists\u2019 mobilization training did not take place in 2020 and last year.\nIt marked the first such cancellation since the country introduced the training program in 1968.\nAll able-bodied South Korean men must serve in the military for around two years.\nThey must also serve as reservists for about eight years from their discharge.<|endoftext|>Like the topic says, Old Man Dam is free of ice.

        "passage": " stretching from the Silla period, through Koryo, and into Joseon has attracted the interest of the academic community.\nFormer head of the Metropolitan Air Quality Management Office and \"Dokdo\" researcher, Seonu Yeong-jun (55), who has recently received a doctorate from Seonggyungwan University, published a book on the 8th entitled, \"Dokdo during the Koryo and Joseon Periods,\" which made public the result of his research on the names of Dokdo and its dominium.\nAccording to the book, the first documentary evidence that both Ulleungdo and Dokdo were Korean land was in the \"History of Koryo,\" when, in the 13th year of King Taejo (930 A.D.), \"Uleungdo\" (\u828b\u9675\u5cf6) appeared. Uleungdo was an abbreviation of \"The Two Islands of Usan/Muleung\" (\u4e8e\u5c71\u6b66\u9675\u4e8c\u5cf6), which was \"one name two island\" (\u4e8c\u5cf6\u4e00\u540d) name for the islands Usanguk (\u4e8e\u5c71\u570b - Ulleungdo) and Muleungdo (\u6b66\u9675\u5cf6).\nDuring the Silla period, the formal name of Ulleungdo and Dokdo was \"The Two Islands of Usan/Muleung,\" which was used together with its abbreviated name \"Uleungdo.\" Dr. Seonu claimed that he has confirmed that the name, \"The Two Islands of Usan/Muleung,\" was used formally in documents, but that \"Uleungdo\" was used in everyday life.\nBefore 512 A.D., the people who set up a country on Ulleungdo were cognizant of \"Dokdo\" and used it as an essential territory. At the time, the concept of \"the two islands were not far apart, so they could be seen on a clear day\" (\u4e8c\u5cf6\u76f8\u8ddd\u4e0d\u9060\u98a8\u65e5\u6df8\u660e\u537d\u53ef\u671b\u898b) was established.\nDr. Seonu said that in 512 A.D. Usanguk became a part of Silla, the name \"Muleungdo\" was formed, and then the written expression \"The two islands of Usan/Muleung are in the sea due east of the hyeon\" was established.\nWhile the name \"Uleungdo\" (\u4e8e\u9675\u5cf6) was used for Ulleungdo and Dokdo in Silla and Usanguk, the name \"Ulleungdo\" started to be used as a dialect in the east coast region of Gangwon. In 1018 A.D., Usanguk fell, and the Gangwondo dialect name also became the commonly used name during the Koryo period.\nDr. Seonu determined that the final name for Ulleungdo and Dokdo went from \"Muleungdo\" (\u6b66\u9675\u5cf6) to \"The Two Islands of Usan/Muleung in the Sea Due East of the Hyeon\" (\u4e8e\u5c71\u6b66\u9675\u4e8c\u5cf6\u5728\u7e23\u6b63\u6771\u6d77\u4e2d), to \"Uleungdo\" (\u4e8e\u9675\u5cf6), to Ulleungdo (\u851a\u9675\u5cf6), to Ulleungdo (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6).\nSince \"Ulleungdo\" (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6) was the very last name for Ulleungdo and Dokdo, it is assumed that when Kim Bu-sik was compiling the Samguksagi, he mistakenly wrote \"Muleungdo\" (\u851a\u9675\u5cf6) as \"Ulleungdo\" (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6).\nOn maps in the latter Joseon, Usando was shown as Ulleungdo's Jukdo (Daetseom), and it is believed that during the time of [King ] Jeongjo and [King] Kojong, the name \"Songjukdo\" [\u677e\u7af9\u5cf6] applied to Dokdo, which demonstrated management and intent.\nDr. Seonu said, \"When you look at the name transition of Dokdo, the possesion of Dokdo was already established during the time of Usanguk and continued unbroken through Silla, Koryo, and Joseon.\" He added, \"Based on international law, Dokdo was never Japanese territory, and Japan only failed in its attempt to make it its territory.\"\nDr. Seonu advocates, \"We need to use Dokdo's original name of \"Muleung\" as a basis and compose a 'Muleungdwon' [Muleungdo Garden?] using Dokdo and ecological technology. Then we have to occasionally promote a plan that uses 'a place of dreams and romance.'\"\nFrom \"Korea and Her Neighbors\" by Isabella Lucy Bird.\n1904 February 20th Japanese map of Korea and Manch...\n1736 ~ 1767 - Yeojido (\u8f3f\u5730\u5716) - Ulleung/Usan (\u9b31\u9675\u4e8e\u5c71\u5169\u5cf6...\n1794 June 3 - Han Chang-guk (\u97d3\u660c\u570b) Inspects Ulleung...\n1786 June 4 - Kim Chang-yun (\u91d1\u660c\u80e4) Inspects Ulleung...\n1863 - Description of Ulleungdo from Kim Jeong-ho'...\n1807 May 12 - Lee Tae-gun (\u674e\u6cf0\u6839) Inspects Ulleungdo...\n1827 May 19 - Ha Si-myeong (\u6cb3\u59cb\u660e) Inspects Ulleungd...\n1831 May 14 - Lee Gyeong-jeong (\u674e\u6176\u9f0e) Inspects Ulle...\n1905 January 28th: Cabinet Decision to Incorporat...\nMid 1700s - \"Paldo Yeojido\" (\u516b\u9053\u8f3f\u5730\u5716) - Ulleungdo Ma...\nKorean Scholar Says \"Usando\" Was Ulleungdo's \"Jukd...\nFrom \"Korea and Her Neighbors\" by Isabella Lucy Bi...\n1900 Oct 27 - Imperial Edict Makes Ulleungdo a Cou...\n1888 - 1895 - Map of Samcheok District & Ulleungdo...<|endoftext|>First and foremost is the striking exterior.

        "passage": " Eighteenth Judicial District on July 1, 2016. Prior to his appointment, Judge Lung served as a district court magistrate in the Eighteenth Judicial District for 13 years. Judge Lung received his undergraduate degree from Regis University in 1992 and his law degree from the University of Dayton School of Law in 1997. Judge Lung is recognized as a subject matter expert in human trafficking and serves on state and national councils in that capacity. He is active in his church, previously volunteered in the \u201cFeed My Starving Children\u201d project and participates as a judge in high school mock trial competitions.\nThe Commission conducted a personal interview with Judge Lung, reviewed opinions that he authored, observed him in court, and reviewed survey responses from attorneys and non-attorneys who had experience with Judge Lung. Survey participants were asked, \u201cbased on your responses to previous questions related to the performance criteria, do you think Judge Lung meets performance standards?\u201d Of the attorneys responding, 88% answered yes, meets performance standards, 6% answered no, does not meet performance standards, 6% had no opinion. Of the non-attorneys responding, 83% answered yes, meets performance standards, 17% answered no, does not meet performance standards and 0% had no opinion. Thirty-six attorneys and fifty-five non-attorneys responded to the judicial performance surveys expressing their opinions of Judge Lung\u2019s performance.\nCurrently, Judge Lung presides over criminal, juvenile and domestic relations dockets. Based on the Commission\u2019s overall evaluation, Judge Lung has demonstrated that he meets performance standards in all categories including case management, application and knowledge of the law, communication, demeanor and diligence. One concern identified by the Commission was a possible over commitment to outside activities taking away from judicial responsibilities. Judge Lung is aware of this concern and during his interview assured the Commission that he will take this concern seriously. Judge Lung is described as a \u201cgood listener,\u201d \u201cconsiderate,\u201d \u201cknowledgeable\u201d and \u201crespectful to those in his courtroom.\u201d His opinions are well-reasoned, supported by the law, and understandable.

We\u2019ll go with 57 players as teams can protect up to four practice squad players (once they clear waivers after the first cut to 53) from being poached each week.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that things change fast, especially considering the coronavirus and the fact that New England has approximately $35 million in available salary cap space.\nJarrett Stidham, Cam Newton, Brian Hoyer.\nThe battle for the starting job between the War Eagle boys should be closer than most think, especially given Stidham\u2019s familiarity with the offense and the lack of preseason games. If Newton is healthy and can absorb Josh McDaniels\u2019s playbook swiftly, this could remain a scary offense, but one that will look dramatically different from the one over the last two decades. Hoyer\u2019s steady hand on the field and in the locker room is invaluable.\nSony Michel, James White, Rex Burkhead, Damien Harris.\nMichel\u2019s recovery from a foot procedure is the big question mark of this group \u2014 he\u2019s currently on the PUP. White\u2019s versatility (he can run, catch, and block) and dependability (he never fumbles) makes him a key cog. Burkhead is another dual threat weapon. Harris was buried on the depth chart as a rookie, but with a year in the program under his belt, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to see him push for an expanded role as both an interior runner and slot receiver.\nHis rookie roster rise was the biggest surprise of 2019. His combination of intelligence, work ethic, and power likely will lead to an expanded role.\nJulian Edelman, N\u2019Keal Harry, Mohamed Sanu, Damiere Byrd, Jakobi Meyers, Jeff Thomas.\nEdelman is Edelman. Injuries hampered Harry\u2019s and Sanu\u2019s initial Patriot seasons and if their workout videos are any indication, both are healthy and ready to go. Expect them to be major contributors. Byrd had 32 catches last season (after 12 his first three years combined) with Arizona and he\u2019ll get pushed by undrafted rookies Will Hastings and Isaiah Zuber. Thomas is one of the most intriguing prospects in camp. The potential home-run threat possesses exquisite speed and body control.\nDevin Asiasi, Dalton Keene.\nMany scouts and evaluators believed Asiasi could be the best combo tight end (a solid blocker and nifty receiver) in the draft and he\u2019ll get plenty of opportunities to prove them right. Keene has the potential to be a hybrid move tight end, H-back, and fullback. Good things happen when the ball is in his hands. Would expect the Patriots to bring in a veteran soon to compete for a spot.\nIsaiah Wynn, Yodny Cajuste, Korey Cunningham, Justin Herron (protected practice-squader).\nOutside of Wynn at left tackle, there\u2019s a lot of openings in this group and it will be one of the most fluid situations of the summer. Cajuste missed last year but was entrenched in the program and is highly thought of in the organization. Cunningham played in just one game last season after being acquired from the Cardinals. Herron played 51 games at Wake Forest and though some projected him as a guard at this level, he could surprise with"

These include ECSONG, Quebec Nut Growers, and recently the Atlantic Provinces Nut growers.\nSONG/ECSONG have established demonstration plantings across the province in some unlikely places for nut trees to grow, with success, I might add.\nThe printing of 4 SONG/ECSONG books, the addition of spray materials for nuts (section 8 of the Ontario spray calendar), a world class website, nut cleaning and processing equipment... and more.\n\"Fruit and nut trees do more than just clean the air and beautify our neighbourhoods,\" said Michael Rosen, Tree Canada President. \"The trees planted will become valuable sources of healthy food for these communities.\"\n\"At Silk we believe plant-based nutrition is a better, more sustainable way to feed people and the planet,\" said Valeric Fleck, Vice President of Whitewave Foods in Canada. \"The Edible Trees program fits perfectly with our mission and we are thrilled 20 communities can benefit in 2014.\"\nThe Butternut is a lovely native tree with a wide distribution in central and eastern United States reaching its northern limits in southern Ontario, southern Quebec and New Brunswick. They have co-existed with other trees in the forests of Eastern Ontario for thousands of years. Now, Butternuts everywhere are under attack by the Butternut Canker Disease. This deadly fungal disease attacks all Butternuts regardless of size or age and there is no known cure. Trees slowly lose vigour, branches start dying and thin black sooty patches appear on the bark. Butternut is classified as an endangered species by both the provincial and federal governments.\nIs there anything we can do? Fortunately, some individual Butternut trees seem to be more tolerant than others, just as some people appear to be naturally more resistant to human illnesses than others. From this simple observation, several groups have developed a Butternut Recovery Program to try and avoid the extinction of one of our most beautiful trees. The Forest Gene Conservation Association, the Rideau Valley Conservation Authority and hundreds of concerned landowners and environmental groups in Eastern Ontario are now into year 8 of the Eastern Ontario Butternut Recovery Program.\nThe basic plan consists of finding and mapping tolerant Butternuts, checking the DNA to avoid hybrids, collecting seeds and then growing healthy seedlings at"

        "passage": " not necessarily translate to employment gains. One research paper observed a U-shaped relationship between education and FLPR. The authors found that Indian women with very low levels of education were actually more likely to be in the labor force than women with some secondary education. In contrast, higher attainment levels are universally associated with higher employment outcomes for men. These findings point to a mismatch between jobs and skillsets of Indian women, which appears to be more significant in urban areas.\nWhat Can Public Policy Do?\nThe underrepresentation of women in the labor force has considerable economic consequences. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that advancing women\u2019s equality could lead to a $12 trillion increase in global output by 2025. Increasing labor-force participation by women would drive more than half of the economic impact, while other potential gains would arise from increasing the number of women in full-time jobs and higher productivity industries. The study also found that if China and India can match the gender parity of their fastest improving neighbors, the two countries could add a total of $3.4 trillion to global GDP by 2025.\nPublic policy is critical for such transitions to take place. In China\u2019s case, there is some low hanging fruit. For instance, China has long mandated different retirement ages for men and women. Many argue that abolishing early retirement requirements for women workers will help improve female labor force participation. But to slow or even reverse the downward trend in FLPR requires coordinated efforts among government, employers, and society. Progress needs to be made, among many other things, on improving the social safety net to reduce the burdens of domestic work, child care, and senior care that often fall on women. In addition, cultural shifts that entail developing a mindset to ensure level playing fields for male and female workers will also be critical. In this regard, China\u2019s recent measures to reduce gender discrimination in hiring, is a welcome, albeit small step.\nFor India, the challenge is profound. The current low level of female participation in the workforce has prevented women from sharing the benefit and economic opportunities associated with the country\u2019s rapid growth. Encouragingly, the government has implemented various programs to confront the challenge. The Skill India Mission, for example, provides vocational training programs tailored to women. The international community supported such endeavors: the World Bank has invested over $3 billion to improve skills and market access for poor women in rural India. But more needs to be done. Infrastructure needs include improving access and safety of transportation. Labor market reforms should focus on bridging job-skill mismatches. At the highest level, social norms need to evolve to support communities that are inclusive and safe to men and women alike.\n1. A few other smaller economies experienced more dramatic reduction in FLPR, but China and India had a larger impact due to the size of their population and economy.<|endoftext|>Researching symptoms of Brainerd diarrhea: Further information about the symptoms of Brainerd diarrhea is available including a list of symptoms of Brainerd diarrhea, or alternatively return to research other symptoms in the symptom center.\nTreatments for Brainerd diarrhea: Various information is available about treatments available for Brainerd diarrhea, prevention of Brainerd diarrhea, or research treatments for other diseases.\nCauses of Brainerd diarrhea: Research more detailed information about the causes of Brainerd diarrhea, or other general information about Brainerd diarrhea.\nStatistics and Brainerd diarrhea: Various sources and calculations are available in statistics about Brainerd diarrhea, prevalence and incidence statistics for Brainerd diarrhea, and you can also research other medical statistics in our statistics center.<|endoftext|>Why I ever decided to subscribe to World Vital Records, I wish I knew.

This example uses the HDL Verifier\u2122 AXI Manager IP to access the HDL Coder generated DUT registers from MATLAB\u00ae. Alternatively, you can use the Xilinx JTAG AXI Master to access the DUT registers using Vivado\u00ae Tcl console by writing Tcl commands. For the Xilinx JTAG AXI Master, you must create a custom reference design. The FPGA design is implemented on the Xilinx Kintex\u00ae-7 KC705 board.\nThe two reference designs differ by only the JTAG manager IP that they use, as this figure shows.\nIn the IP core generation workflow of the HDL Workflow Advisor, in the Set Target Reference Design step, set the Insert AXI Manager (HDL Verifier required) parameter to an interface that communicates between your host machine and the target hardware. This option adds AXI manager IP for your interface automatically into the reference design and connects the added IP to the DUT IP using the AXI4-slave interface. The next section details the steps to auto-insert the JTAG AXI Manager IP in the reference design.\nFollow these steps to execute the IP core workflow for the Default System reference design, which uses JTAG AXI Manager IP. Using this reference design, you can generate an HDL IP core that blinks LEDs on the KC705 board. To generate an HDL IP core, follow these steps.\n4. In step 1.1, set Target workflow to IP Core Generation and Target platform to Xilinx Kintex-7 KC705 development board. Click Run This Task.\n5. In step 1.2, set Reference design to Default System. Under Reference design parameters, set Insert AXI Manager (HDL Verifier required) to JTAG. Click Run This Task.\n6. In step 1.3, set the interface of the Blink_frequency, Blink_direction, and Read_back ports to AXI4-Lite. Set the interface of the LED port to LEDs General Purpose [0:7].\nThe base address for an HDL Coder IP core is defined as 0x40000000 for the Default System reference design, which uses the AXI Manager IP. You can see address setting in the generated IP core report as shown in this figure.\nIf you have the HDL Verifier support package for Xilinx FPGA boards, select the AXI Manager reference design, then you can use MATLAB command line interface to access the IP core that is generated by the HDL Coder product.\ncreate_hw_axi_txn wr_enable [get_hw_axis hw_axi_1]...\ncreate_hw_axi_txn wr_disable [get_hw_axis hw_axi_1]...\nYou can use the JTAG AXI Manager IP to interface with HDL Coder IP core registers in systems that do not have an embedded ARM processor, such as the Kintex-7. You can use this IP as a first step to debug standalone HDL Coder IP cores, prior to hand coding software for soft processors, (such"

        "passage": " used that against dean...mix that with dean's insecurities and you have dean believing what gad said...although none of it was true. so maybe dean is simply reacting still to what gad said...or maybe it's about the moc and addiction at this point. I mean lately, it's all about dean justifying his kills. it's about dean justifying his obsession with abbadon. but really it's about feeding his need....isn't it easier for dean to believe the worst, to believe what in no way, shape, or form is true, that sam wouldn't save him... sam doesn't care about him, so it doesn't matter that he feeds the need to kill. isn't it easier for dean to believe in what isnt' true to justify his obsession and need for the blade. to push sam away...to isolate himself....to condone his actions...\nafter dean made that comment...sam said no...then he said...jody.....isn't it just as likely that sam's no was to dean's snarky comment about not doing the same...saving him. but sam knew the danger jody was in and he was very weak being drained of his blood....thanks dean for letting that go on as long as it did....that all sam could muster was \"no\"....and with every bit of strength left he reminded dean of jody....\nI personally believe this to be the case, especially after rewatching mother's little helper and Crowley's speech to dean and given the episodes following bloodlines.\nwhat is your take on it? do you think it could be more about addiction at this point and his need to kill and less about his mistaken belief that sam wouldn't save him....given that after that speech, I believe sam has saved dean a few times. bury the guilt...hide behind it...and now that the moc/blade have reunited...thus wielding it's control over dean...it's now about doing and believing whatever it takes to justify dean's obsession and desire to kill...and not just abbadon.\nI liked this one a lot - one of the better episodes of the second half of S9. While it wasn't primarily about Sam & Dean, a lot of parallels to them in the story telling. Snarky comment to Sam aside, Dean wasn't as petulant or angsty this week. We even had some brotherly banter - sorely missing in S8/S9. And Sam is shown to be starting to grasp the seriousness of the situation with his brother. This vamp kill replaced Dean's in Fresh Blood as my second favorite SPN vamp kill; Sam taking out Gordon with razor wire is still my favorite. Even with the brothers on the outs, Sam still leaned on Dean going down the stairs.\nAlways enjoy seeing Sheriff Jody - a well written, well rounded character. Also like the sense of continuity/call back to earlier episodes when Sam asked her about the shoulder. Did Sam and Dean give her that plaid shirt for Christmas or her birthday? Looks straight out of the Sam Winchester collection.\nTechnically, you can't drain all of the blood from a human body that way - your BP drops to try to compensate and you'd be left with some blood circulating - doesn't mean you wouldn't die, though.\nHi Nappi, thanks so much for reading and commenting! I think you ask a great question and my take is that all of the points are in play. I think Dean was afraid that Gadreel's comments were true and Sam really doesn't want him as a brother; I think he's struggling with his addiction and finding ways to justify it; I think he's angry at himself for putting Sam in the position of being controlled by Gadreel and he's angry at Sam for not understanding why Dean can't bear to survive him--he's a mess, basically. I never think either brother is a dinkhead, but I do think each one can get caught up in flawed interpretations, especially when they are also caught up in an addiction. This season was Dean's turn.\nI think Carver envisions this arc as a three season arc, so I think the acknowledgement by Dean to Sam about the impact of the possession decision is to come next season. I suspect the boys will be able to find common ground as Sam grapples with losing Dean and they'll finally have a conversation where they both open up and really listen. I think the end of this episode was meant to show how unconditional love can be healthy. I think next season will be about healing the boys.\nLOL. Love ya!\nThis was one of my favorite episodes of the season and the reason why Robert Berens is quickly becoming my favorite writer on the show. This is what happens when you have a strong script, great characters, great guest stars and just enough brothers and story movement to satisfy the arc of the season. I was on the edge of my seat through the whole episode (even on 3rd watch). But boy did Jody take a beating...even worse than Sam!\nIt was a superb episode with many tie ins and references to the past. The format was original SPN. I also noticed that Dean is suddenly awake after being knocked out and the MoC was not let him sleep much. I choose to believe that he was initially knocked out and then when conscious, waiting for the right moment to attack back. It did strike me as odd that there seems to be a bit of a wait period before he goes to Sam who is almost 'Tapped out\". Luckily, Sam was written as weak afterwards by standing up holding onto the railing. Dean's \"Look at me bitch!\" makes you know he is supercharged just like when Sam took Gordon's head. All is not fine with the Winchesters. Dean telling Alex-Annie- she had not thought out the consequences of her decision- can he hear himself talking- yep. Almost as if he knows he has consequences to pay also.<|endoftext|>This Improv Holiday Concert in the Fiery Furnace of Arches National Park was performed and filmed live in one take in 360\u00b0 video with by Abel James.

In Odontobutis species, the three species showed the diploid chromosome number, 2n=44 (NF=44) telocentric chromosomes. In Cottus species, the mitotic chromosomes from 24 groups with two chromosomes each indicated that it is a diploid. The karyotype of C. koreanus and C. hangiongensis is 2n=48 and NF=52. These species is the first report on the chromosomes and the karyotype analysis except O. platycephala. Our findings provide cytotaxonomic evidence for the species distinctness of these five species whose descriptions were based primarily on external morphology.\nThree specimens of a small sculpin, Icelinus japonicus, were collected from the midwestern coastal waters of the Korean Peninsula firstly. The species is characterized by having two ctenoid scale rows extending posterior end of the second dorsal fin along the dorso-lateral surface of the body, pelvic fin with a spine and two soft rays, and teeth on vomer and palatines. A new Korean name, \"Du-jul-bil-neul-hoes-dae\", is proposed for the species.\nA three specimen of Icelus toyamensis, belonging to Cottidae, Scorpaeniformes, was firstly collected from the East Sea, Korea during 2007-2009. We herein described the species as the first record from Korea on the basis of these specimens. Icelus toyamensis is characterized by the following morphological combinations: spinous scales absent on the base of dorsal fin; small ctenoid scales scattered on body sides; gill rakers are short, tubular, and relatively broad; the uppermost preopercular spine is sharp and simple; dorsal fin rays VIII-IX, 20-21; anal fin soft rays 18-19; pectoral fin rays 18, and vertebrae 40-41. New Korean name of I. toyamensis is proposed as \"Min-jul-ga-si-hoet-dae.\"\nSixteen specimens of Artediellus fuscimentus, belonging to the family Cottidae, were collected from the coastal waters off Samcheok and Donghae, Korea, in December 2010 and February 2015, respectively.  We also analyzed 600 base pairs of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b sequence to confirm the taxonomic status of the specimens. The sequences of our specimens corresponded completely to those of Japanese A. fuscimentus, but differed from those of A. atlanticus (d=0.057~0.061). We propose the new Korean names \"Eom-ji-hoet-dae-sok\" for the genus Artediellus and \"Eom-ji-hoet-dae\" for the species A. fuscimentus.\nFour specimens (114.2~134.2 mm SL) of Icelus stenosomus Andriashev, family Cottidae, were collected from Goseong-gun, Gangwon-do, East Sea of Korea. They were identified based on the following characters : a pair of strong spines on occipital region, distinct row of scales on both dorsal and ventral sides of body, vermiculate white lines on dorsal side of body, and small prickled scales scattered sparsely on the head.

A great awakening has spread across Europe as nations have banded together, abandoned their pacifist inclinations and strengthened their defenses under the banner of democracy and human rights.\nGermany\u2019s decision to spend more than $100 billion on defense in a one-shot expenditure and boost annual military spending to the two percent of the gross domestic product that NATO members are supposed to allocate to their militaries, as Deutsche Welle explained, is perhaps the greatest sign of the change that has occurred on the continent.\nBut it\u2019s not the only one. European countries have overhauled their policies toward Russia, the Washington Post noted. They banned Russian-controlled media in the European Union, enacted tough sanctions on Russian institutions and, perhaps most importantly, spent EU funds to give Ukraine weapons.\nAdditionally, Poland, Bulgaria and Slovakia are working on giving their Russian-made fighter jets to Ukraine \u2013 a potential game-changer in the country\u2019s fight against Russia. As NBC News noted, they want assurances that the US will allow them to buy modern American jets to replace the ones they lose, however.\nEven neutral countries like Finland and Sweden are getting into the act. NATO leaders are now including the two countries in their deliberations, according to Defense News. More than half of the Finnish public and more than 40 percent of Swedes now support joining the alliance. Neutral Switzerland, meanwhile, has joined the US and EU in imposing economic sanctions on Russian elites, Radio France Internationale reported.\nPerhaps Putin has effectuated a self-fulfilling prophecy regarding a Europe unified against his homeland, the Los Angeles Times claimed. The Encyclopedia Britannica defined the psychology behind the concept as an \u201coriginally false expectation [that] leads to its own confirmation.\u201d The idea is that Putin prophesized European aggression, took actions to counter it in Ukraine and thereby forced Europeans to become more aggressive, fulfilling his worst fears.\nBritish journalist Peter Hitchens would disagree. Writing in the Daily Mail, he argued that such analyses ignore the West\u2019s and Ukraine\u2019s role in ratcheting up tensions with Russia over the years.\nEither way, the possibility of World War III in Europe is more real than ever. Putin has described economic sanctions as the equivalent to \u201cdeclaring war,\u201d noted National Public Radio. Calls for a Western-imposed no-fly zone over Ukraine, for example, could force Russian jets to fight NATO jets in the sky over the country, warned Jacobin, a leftist magazine.\nThe Russian president might be assuming that Europe won\u2019t spark a war in order to defeat aggression, violence and authoritarianism. He could be wrong. But he also might be harboring a death wish.\nA global anti-money laundering watchdog placed the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on its \u201cgray list\u201d over concerns that the Gulf country has not taken enough steps to curb illegal financial activities, CNBC reported.\nThe French-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) said that the UAE was subject to increased monitoring because of \u201cstrategic deficiencies\u201d in its attempts to counter money laundering. Still, it acknowledged that the country had made efforts to thwart money laundering and terrorism financing.\nThe designation places the Gulf nation on a list of 22 others including Syria, Albania, and Panama. The watchdog said the \u201cgray list\u201d is not as severe as the \u201cblacklist,\u201d which includes Iran and North Korea.\nThe Emirates is the financial hub of the Middle East and hosts many international companies\u2019 headquarters. But the UAE also has a reputation for being an easy place to move large sums of cash in and out of the country and lax inspection in certain sectors, such as real estate deals, according to the Financial Times.\nThe inclusion in the list will impact the UAE\u2019s reputation as a global financial hub, although Gulf-based bankers noted that the move will not stop financial institutions looking to set up in the country.\nSouth Korean firefighters and troops battled a large wildfire over the weekend that tore through the country\u2019s eastern coastal area, forcing thousands to evacuate and threatening two energy facilities in the region, the Associated Press reported.\nThe fire began Friday morning near the seaside town of Uljin and spread across more than 14,800 acres to the nearby city of Samcheok. More than 6,200 people have been evacuated and at least 159 homes and 46 other buildings have been destroyed.\nThe government deployed about 7,000 firefighters, troops and public workers, as well as 65 helicopters and more than 500 vehicles to contain the blaze.\nThe wildfire also threatened to spread to a liquid natural gas production facility and a nuclear power plant near Uljin but authorities were able to prevent the blaze from hitting them.\nSo far, no casualties have been reported. Officials said they are investigating the cause of the blaze.\nThe disaster comes just before South Korea holds its presidential elections, Bloomberg noted, adding to a growing number of stressors: Weeks before the March 9 polls, neighboring North Korea has been conducting various missile tests, including suspected ballistic missiles.\nChile will create a large national park to protect the country\u2019s hundreds of glaciers melting because of climate change, Agence France-Presse reported.\nThe new National Glacier Park will cover more than 185,000 acres of the Andes mountain about 40 miles from the capital, Santiago.\nOutgoing President Sebastian Pinera hailed the park as \u201ca fundamental step that our country is taking to combat the destruction of nature.\u201d He said the initiative will protect 368 glaciers, as well as preserve species native to the region, such as pumas and foxes.\nThe president added that the glaciers hold 32 times more water than the reservoir that serves Santiago\u2019s seven million population.\nThe park\u2019s establishment comes amid global concern that the warming climate is melting glaciers around the world. A study by the University of Chile found that glaciers in the central part of the country \u2013 where the park is also located \u2013 are shrinking because of global warming.\nChile ranks among the top 10 nations in the world in terms of glacier surface area. The list also includes Canada, the United States, China and Russia.\nA second day of attempted evacuations of residents of the besieged southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol failed Sunday as both Russia and Ukraine accused each other of violating a ceasefire agreement, Reuters reported. And as Russian forces continued to bomb Ukrainian cities \u2013 and target civilians, according to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken \u2013 world leaders began raising questions of Russian war crimes. Meanwhile, Ukraine is set to ask the United Nations\u2019 highest court Monday to stop Russia\u2019s invasion \u2013 the International Court of Justice adjudicates legal disputes between states. Separately, Ukraine is dispatching teams to bombed sites to gather evidence of possible war crimes at another international tribunal.\nRussian police detained more than 4,500 people in 49 cities across Russia who were protesting against Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Al Jazeera noted. The Kremlin has also blocked social media platforms Facebook and Twitter in the country over alleged \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against Russian media, CBS News reported. Meanwhile, major western media outlets such as Bloomberg and the BBC and social media companies such as TikTok pulled out of Russia because of a draconian new media censorship law.\nThe United Nations estimated that more than 360 civilians have been killed in Ukraine, although Ukrainian officials put the death toll at more than 2,000 civilians, the Washington Post wrote. Meanwhile, the UN said about 1.5 million have fled the country, describing the exodus as the fastest and largest displacement of people in Europe since World War II, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nMore than 500 Russian soldiers have been killed and about 1,600 injured during Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Among the dead are three Russian generals, including Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky, a top figure in the Russian military, the Independent reported.\nThe United States and Poland are considering providing Soviet-era fighter jets to Ukraine to fend off invading Russian forces, NBC News wrote. Meanwhile, NATO and other Western officials have refused to establish a \u201cno-fly\u201d zone over Ukraine, citing fears that such a move would exacerbate the conflict, Politico noted. Russia said Sunday that countries hosting Ukrainian combat aircraft could be viewed by Moscow as parties to the conflict.<|endoftext|>Data centers can get very hot \u2014 especially once you start using all the computing power that's required by AI and other cutting-edge technologies.\nData centers are notoriously uncomfortable: Racks and racks of servers throw off an immense amount of heat, requiring elaborate cooling fans and air conditioning systems just to keep it all from overheating.\nThe rise of AI requires advanced supercomputing power \u2014 which means a level of heat from the processors that's impractical or inefficient to handle with more traditional approaches.\nLiquid cooling, which literally dissipates heat by running water through pipes around the processor, is becoming a rising standard: Water has as much as 3,000 times the heat absorption capacity as air, and doesn't even need to be refrigerated, saving on electricity.\nLiquid cooling was held back because of fears that the water may spring a leak and damage the equipment. But thanks to great advances in the engineering required, liquid cooling is now finding its niche, especially in newly-constructed data centers.\nThe alternative to liquid cooling has been to design data centers to be less dense, making them easier to cool, but reducing their overall computing capacity.\nThe inside of a data center or computer room is not a pleasant place to be. It's so loud due to server fans that workers have to wear ear muffs if they spend an extended amount of time in there. It's hot from the server exhaust and the smell of hot metal, primarily from the ventilation of heat sinks"

The mitochondrial genome of T. violaceus had a structure and organization similar to that of other Octopoda. The content of the nucleotides A, C, G, and T was 31.68 %, 7.71 %, 20.02 %, and 40.58 %, respectively. All protein-coding genes (PCG) began with the ATG codon, excluding ND4 and ATP6, which began with ATC and ATT, respectively, and terminated with TAG, TAA, TA, or T. Codons for isoleucine were the most used codons, whereas those for arginine were used the least. Two extra tRNAs, trnN and trnL, were found in the control region. These tRNAs have a D-armless structure. The control region had excess A + T content (83.16 %) and a stem-loop structure with two elements, which is reported for the first time in Octopoda by our study. Bayesian inference using 13 PCG revealed that Octopus and Octopodidae were polyphyletic, and that Tremoctopodidae diverged relatively earlier within Octopoda. The mitochondrial genome of T. violaceus and its characteristics may help to understand the evolutionary history of Octopoda and establish a marine biodiversity conservation strategy.\n\nIn East Asia, the presence of T. violaceus has been recorded in the coastal waters of Japan and the nearby South China Sea (Georeferenced records in GBIF, https://www.gbif.org), as well as on the shore of Samcheok-si, Kangwon-do, South Korea in 2019. Specimens of T. violaceus are very rarely collected in East Asia; therefore, its distribution status, dispersing history, and phylogenetic relationships with populations found in other regions are unclear. Ever since the mitochondrial (mt) genome of Octopus vulgaris was first reported (Yokobori et al., 2004), complete mt genomes of over 20 Octopoda species have been reported. Most animal mt genomes generally have a compact size (14-19 kb), circular form, and comprise 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 tRNAs, two rRNAs, and a noncoding control region (Boore, 1999). The mt genome has been used for identifying species, tracking evolutionary history, and making inferences related to comparative genomics from nucleotide composition, structural features, and gene rearrangement, etc. (Boore, 1999;Kumazawa et al., 1996;Li et al., 2016;Yu et al., 2019). Molecular phylogeny performed using mt genomes is useful for resolving controversial evolutionary relationships among various animal groups. Uribe & Zardoya (2017) revisited the phylogeny of Cephalopoda using complete mt genomes, and suggested that Octopus and Octopodidae are polyphyletic, as reported in previous studies (Cheng et al., 2013;Magall\u00f3n-Gay\u00f3n et al., 2020).\nRecently, the importance of biodiversity has led to worldwide attention because biodiversity affects ecosystem functions (Baert et al., 2018;Isbell et al., 2018;O'Connor et al. 2017). Biodiversity is highly threatened by climate change, therefore, many advanced countries are making a lot of efforts to preserve global biodiversity through the Nagoya protocol, etc. Research on biodiversity begins with identifying species, and genetic analysis methods are widely used as a tool to identify species and analyze phylogenetic relationships (Chen & Wang, 2021;Yi et al., 2021).\nThis study presents the sequencing of the complete mt genome of T. violaceus and the description of the T. violaceus mt genome organization and phylogenetic analysis using the mt 13 PCG sequences that are generally found in species of the Octopoda.\n\nDNA extraction and mitochondrial genome sequencing\nOur study was performed using a T. violaceus specimen caught by a fisherman in the sea near the Jeju east pier, and donated for research. Genomic DNA was extracted from a small piece of muscle using a Nucleospin Tissue Kit (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The complete mt genome was amplified and sequenced using newly designed primers, including nested primers for primer walking sequencing. All sequencing reactions were conducted at Bionics (Seoul, Korea).\n\nGene annotation and sequence analysis\nThe complete mt genome was annotated using MITOS (Bernt et al., 2013) and ORF Finder (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ orffinder) using the invertebrate mitochondrial code. The complete mt genome map was drawn using SnapGene 5 software. The codon usage of 13 PCGs was analyzed using MEGA X (Kumar et al., 2018). The tRNA genes were identified using webbased tRNAscan-SE software (Lowe & Eddy, 1997) and ARW-EN (Laslett & Canb\u00e4ck, 2008).\n\nPhylogenetic analysis\nTo reconstruct the phylogenetic tree within the Octopoda, previously reported mt genomes of species in Octopoda were collected from the GenBank database and 13 PCG sequences were aligned using Clustal X (Thompson et al., 1997) with default settings. Bayesian inference (BI) performed using MrBayes 3.2 software (Ronquist et al., 2012) was used for phylogenetic tree reconstruction. The GTR + G + I model was selected as the best evolutionary model using jmodeltest2 (Darriba et al., 2012). Four Markov chains were run for 100,000 generations and sampled every 100 generations to obtain a posterior probability (PP) distribution of 1,000 trees. Vampyroteuthis infernalis (AB266515) was used as the outgroup (Uribe & Zardoya, 2017).\nAs observed in other animals, the mt genome of T. violaceus has 13 PCGs encoded on the heavy and the light strand. NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1), ND6, cytochrome b, ND4L, ND4, and ND5 were encoded on the heavy strand and\n\nFisheries and Aquatic Sciences\nThe total number of codons used in the 13 PCGs was 3,750, wherein codons corresponding to trnI were the most used (257 times), while codons for trnR were used the least (three times) ( Table 2). Among the 3,750 codons, the proportion of codons for trnL was 15.2 % (571/3,750, the most used codon), whereas that for trnR was 1.3 % (50/3,750, the least used codon). trnL and trnS were coded by six and eight different codons, respectively. trnA, trnR, trnG, trnP, trnT, and trnV were coded by four different cod"

They are characteristic for deep sea habitats, such as hot vents and seeps where they form spectacular animal communities that have been studied in detail in the last four decades. Less spectacular but not less diverse are such symbioses in shallow water habitats. Here many of the invertebrate hosts belong to the meiofauna, microscopic animals less than one to a few mm in size. We study marine sediments that harbour a variety of these symbioses, such as mouthless catenulid flatworms (Paracatenula), mouthless siphonolaimid nematodes (Astomonema) and stilbonematine nematodes. The latter are the present focus of our group.\nStilbonematinae are obligatory associated with bacterial ectosymbionts. These symbionts are chemolithoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing gammaproteobacteria, which coat the cuticle on the body surface of the worms in a host-species specific manner. There is molecular evidence that each host species carries one specific symbiont species. The bacteria are a (or probably the exclusive) source of food for the worms, which in turn provide their symbionts alternately with electron donors and acceptors by migrating through the chemocline in marine sandy sediments. Although the symbiosis has defied cultivation so far, several species have become model systems for fundamental biological questions, such as host/symbiont recognition and specificity, partner fidelity and exotic bacterial division mechanisms. Despite the interest in physiology and cell biology of the symbiosis, the taxonomy, phylogeny and biogeography of the Stilbonematinae is still poorly known.<|endoftext|>Chi non ha mai avuto a che fare con un narcisista?

Companies with relatively new thermal concepts like power towers argue that they can undercut PV projects. Thermal power plants can provide energy storage too. But the relentless economics of the PV industry, combined with the permitting and planning challenges inherent in thermal projects, will be difficult to avoid.\nThe solar thermal, or concentrating solar power (CSP) industry began to flourish in the late 1980s and early '90s in California with the construction of 354 megawatts of parabolic trough plants in the Mojave Desert.\nThen, the state allowed a real estate tax exemption to lapse, a change in the law that companies like Solel and Luz warned would kill them off. Right after Luz ran out of money, Governor Pete Wilson signed an extension to the law.\nA second wave of CSP activity began around 2004 with the revival of green technology in the state. Luz founder Arnold Goldman rounded up the old team, recruited some new execs and founded BrightSource Energy. Peter Le Lievre and a group of Australians came up with Ausra and built a plant in Las Vegas.\nAdvocates said that solar thermal plants, if 500 megawatts or larger, could rival natural gas in cost per kilowatt-hour. Another lapse in the property tax exemption loomed, but ultimately was avoided.\nThen the 2008 financial crisis hit. The sudden decline of funding hit the industry particularly hard, considering that a demo plant costs around $25M and a commercial plant requires somewhere north of $250M. Ausra and eSolar had to retool their strategies, while BrightSource had to sell part of its first project at Ivanpah to Bechtel.\nIf that weren\u2019t enough, environmentalists and U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein pushed to declare a million acres of the Mojave a protected zone. Concerns about desert tortoises forced BrightSource to scale Ivanpah down to 370 megawatts. It was as if nineteenth-century coal miners blamed their lot on the gruel purity standards being imposed on mining camp cafeterias.\nBut the projects have in recent weeks begun to get the necessary approvals from the California Energy Commission and the Bureau of Land Management, just in time to qualify for the Treasury Grant program.\nThe approvals make the near-term outlook for CSP looks pretty bright, as BrightSource's Ivanpah, Abengoa's Solana, and Tessera's Imperial all look likely to break ground this year.\nUntil you start to look at the price trends for PV panels.\nThis issue is illustrated in the following capital-cost-per-watt chart (we have removed the y-axis labels as this is an excerpt from the upcoming GTM Research CSP Report). In 2010, the price to build a CSP park run by troughs, power towers or dish engines will cost between $5.00 and $6.55 per watt (AC). On the other hand, utility-scale PV projects can squeak through at less than $3.50 per watt (DC).\nBy 2020, the CSP solutions are expected to be in the $2.40 to $3.80 per watt (AC) range, but by that time, PV plants could be below $2 a watt (DC). Trough and tower plants are behind PV, and not likely to catch up.\nThe better comparison is levelized cost of energy (LCOE), as this corrects for the DC-to-AC conversion that PV needs to deal with, the differences in O&M, and the differing amounts of kWh generated per watt of equipment installed (as yields vary by technology). This second chart depicts the LCOE on an apples-to-apples basis (same location, same plant size, same financing terms). Again, PV is cheaper today, and is expected to widen its edge over the next decade. By 2020, the CSP technologies are expected to be in the $0.10-$0.12/kWh range, whereas PV is forecast between $0.07 and $0.08/kWh.\nA bleak outlook?\nAs a sign of the times, NRG Energy decided that instead of building CSP plants using eSolar Towers, it would use the sites for PV plants. They did this both in California (Alpine SunTower) and in New Mexico.\nThis sort of reversal wasn\u2019t expected in 2006 or 2007, but since then, the Chinese have ramped up their solar PV manufacturing, the cost of polysilicon has slid dramatically, and the overall cost of PV modules has declined significantly. Both Solon and SunPower now make solar power plants \u201cin a box\u201d that can generate 1 megawatt. They come straight from the factory on big rigs.\nIf you accept the following two premises, the future for CSP looks pretty bleak.\n1) PV is now cheaper than CSP on a levelized cost basis, and will reduce its costs faster than CSP going forward.\n2) When awarding solar power purchase agreements (PPAs), utilities will choose the lowest price option.\nSo what could prevent this scenario from coming to pass?\ni) CST plants produce more consistent power output (less'spiky-ness'). These plants can produce power fairly consistently throughout the day because of the inertia of the turbine and the ability to burn natural gas when clouds roll in. When clouds blanket a PV plant, the output can drop off a cliff. The last time the solar thermal plants in the Mojave experienced an eyebrow-raising drop in power it was because Mt. Pinatubo blew.\nii) CST power plants fit naturally with storage systems and can even continue to produce power at night. For now, if utilities want solar with storage, the only economic option is CST (trough, tower, or CLFR). Perhaps at some point in the future, new technologies like sodium batteries and dry cell batteries from Xtreme Power may help PV developers even out the storage gap.\nAre utilities willing to take quality or storage into account? Apparently, not at the moment.\n\u201cUtilities aren\u2019t willing to pay for consistency and storage,\u201d said Brad Friesen, Vice President of the Renewables business line at Fluor, one of the largest EPC (engineering, procurement, & construction) firms in the world. Most of the utilities are concerned about meeting their renewable portfolio requirements, he said. Five years from now, utilities might question their thinking, he added, but right now, these considerations are not given much weight.\nAnd price is not the only area where CST plants are at a disadvantage.\nTrough, CLFR, and tower plants require large turbines to operate, and the economics for steam turbines only work with 50 MW+ plants. So modularity is not an option for CST plants. One notable exception is augmentation. If they locate the solar field next to an existing coal or gas plant, in which case it acts as a booster to an existing power block, then the economics for sub-50 MW CST plants could work.\nDevelopers have figured out that it is much easier (and faster) to site, permit and get transmission arranged for a sub-20 MW plant than it is for a larger project. That effectively rules out trough, CLFR, and tower, but allows for traditional flat-plate PV, CPV, and potentially dish-engine options.\nThe economics of CST require that they be located in a more constrained geographic band.\nSolar thermal still has a lot of appeal. Some of the newer technologies (e.g., towers, CLFR, and dish-engines) are just coming out and may surprise us in their ability to lower costs. Other technologies like SolarReserve\u2019s cycling salt could further wring out inefficiencies. (Friesen, for example, is a fan of SolarReserve.) When quality and storage are required, solar thermal comes out cheaper than nuclear. The capital costs for nuclear plants are $6,000 a kilowatt, or $6 a watt, or more, not including waste storage, and often rise"

The silky unrestrained Merlot provide a seductive entry and mid-palate that is both expansive and lush, while the Franc lends a backbone of subtle concentration, built on suave tannins guaranteeing a structured longevity.\nThe Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon in this blend is from our Twin Peaks estate vineyard, while the Cabernet Franc hails from acclaimed viticulturist David Abreu\u2019s Madrona Ranch. The vineyards are farmed with meticulous attention to detail, maintaining yields at sparse levels\u2014ranging from two to three tons per acre. The wine is composed of just a few of our best lots from these most cherished sites.\nGrapes were picked in the darkness of the early morning hours. The freshly-harvested fruit immediately underwent rigorous selection by our three-tiered sorting process, which included our cutting-edge optical sorter. Whole berries were gently delivered by gravity to tank using our crane system, minimizing disruption of berry integrity. Cold soaks lasted approximately seven days, and fermentations were managed via a combination of d\u00e9lestage, pumpovers, and punchdowns. Extended maceration ranging from four to five weeks fine-tuned our tannin profiles, allowing us to perfect mouth feel and wine complexity.

These include dehydration and excessive acid in the urine, urinary tract infections, among others. Now, depending on the cause and the kind of stone, your doctor will prescribe the best treatment.\nHowever, if you have small-sized stones, the natural cures are deemed to be effective for passing them through your body. Conversely, if the kidney stones are very large to pass through your kidneys, you require extensive treatment to get rid of them.\nAlso, kidneys stones are of various types. As part of this list, calcium phosphate stones, calcium oxalate, cystine stones, uric acid stones, and struvite stones are included.\nThough kidney stones are not normally life-threatening situations, they are typically not a pleasant experience.

They ventured an impressive 13,000 miles, from the southernmost tip of Patagonia in South America all the way up to Los Angeles, California. Needless to say, it\u2019s a \u2018Long Way Up,\u2019 especially when you\u2019re out in the middle of nowhere with no place to charge.\nWe may have seen some glimpses of this journey over the course of the past year in some of the videos Rivian has published. However, this is the first we\u2019ve heard that it will be presented as a full series on Apple TV+ on Friday, September 18, 2020. Of course, it\u2019s called \u2018Long Way Up.\u2019 Apparently Rivian was asked to provide the vehicles for the series.\nThe crazy part here is Rivian makes it clear that these \u201cearly prototypes\u201d aren\u2019t up to the abilities of the actual production vehicle. So, if you find the R1T\u2019s capability incredible, you\u2019re probably in for a real treat when the truck comes to market next year.\nThe team drove for 100 days and crossed through 13 countries. Much of the area was wide open spaces with lots of wildlife. As you can see, some of the driving was on paved roads and lots was through the mountains, while other times the truck is seen on dirt, over prairies, on the sand, and in the water.\nTo make it all happen, Rivian had to actually build out a charging network through south and central South America. This is all a fantastic way to prove the capabilities of its upcoming vehicles. We look forward to watching the series next month.\nHead on over to our RivianChat forum to engage in conversation with other Rivian fans and soon-to-be owners.<|endoftext|>Home / Milk Chocolate Co...\nWabi Sabi Milk Chocolate Cookies & Cream is an artisanal chocolate, uniquely pairing fine Belgian Chocolate with premium full spectrum cannabis for great taste and effect.

I have a secret confession to make about me and these little cruciferous veggies, I have never been a huge fan of them! Isn't that weird, considering I will eat almost anything that doesn't eat me first!\nIt might be because I didn't really grow up eating them, unless we had them at someone else's house. My mother never cooked them and now looking back and thinking about it, I bet she is not a big fan either!\nI say this because my mother cooked almost everything, especially vegetables, unless she didn't like it! However, she would never admit not liking something. She was tricky like that!\nI guess if she admitted there was food that was unlikable, it would give us an excuse not to eat something. We did enjoy most all of the other cruciferous cousins to the brussel sprout, like broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage! I must admit, I have had a change of heart about the brussel sprout now!\nI have found that this recipe for brussel sprouts is really very tasty! It has brown sugar and bacon so how bad could it be really? It's also quick and easy which makes it a great choice!\nFry the bacon in a a skillet until crisp. Remove to a paper towel lined plate. Reserve the drippings in the pan. Turn the heat to medium. Place the sliced brussel sprouts, cut side down in the hot drippings. If there are loose leaves that fall off, you can discard them.\nAllow the cut side to sort of brown or char. See the two I turned over how they are browned. This takes about 3 -4 minutes. Brown them without burning them. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and garlic powder to taste. Turn them over and sprinkle with brown sugar then the soy sauce and vinegar. Place the top on the pan and steam the for about 5 to 7 minutes! This makes them tender!\nRemove the lid and turn the heat up to medium high. Toss the brussel sprouts until the liquid has caramelized! Sprinkle the top with the crumbled bacon right before serving!<|endoftext|>FOMO \u2014 fear of missing out. Even my 3 year old suffers from this to an extent. His is not rooted in technology like so many people these days, but he won\u2019t even take a nap if he thinks something more exciting is going on. So maybe his desire to feel included is not exactly FOMO as we define it today, but there is something to be said about his need to be connected to others.\nThe term was first coined by business consultant Dr. Dan Herman in the mid-90\u2019s while he was researching consumerism and opportunity. It was then made popular in the early 2000\u2019s by author and entrepreneur, Patrick J. McGinnis, who was able to adapt the theory to how co-eds socialize in a collegiate atmosphere. When McGinnis\u2019s article was published in 2004, social media was not nearly as important to our sense of identity and well-being as it has become.\nToday, many people suffer from FOMO in one way or another. But what's the greatest cause for concern is that it's directly related to an increase in anxiety and depression caused by the rising use of mobile devices and social media.\nIn addition to FOMO, there's nomophobia: when separated from their mobile devices, it's been found that students experience distinct symptoms of disconnection anxiety. Adolescents and young adults also suffer from Social Media Dysphoria: the development of identity based on social media interactions.\nAlthough FOMO, Nomophobia, and Social Media Dysphoria are not official diagnoses yet, a great number of studies show how all three forms of anxiety can predict future potentially serious psychopathology.\nI have only been teaching for 13 years and a parent for 5 years \u2014 and the drastic increase in teen attempted and completed suicides gives me pause. It went from an occasional tragedy to the forefront of so much of our instruction. I worry about my 5 year old daughter who feels she needs to be included in everything her neighborhood friends do, and who will throw a tantrum if she cannot participate.\nMy children, and most other toddlers, are demonstrating an aspect of Self-Determination Theory. The Oxford Handbook of Human Motivation defines human psychological needs stemming from the desire to be competent, autonomous, and connected to other individuals. When my son throws a tantrum because he doesn\u2019t want to take a nap, it\u2019s because he wants to feel connected to others.\nMost teens satisfy their need for connection through their mobile devices. Checking text message notifications, snaps, Instagram, and more \u2014 all are compulsive actions driven by a culture perpetuating them. When teens do not get the notification they are expecting, or no notifications at all, their sense of self-worth diminishes.\nRemember the days when you constantly told your students to be quiet? That\u2019s almost never the case anymore. When I look around, I see students, staring at their devices, not interacting. Or if they are talking, it\u2019s to show something from a device to another person.\nThey don\u2019t look up.\nAbout two years ago, I"

Hiking, cycling, fishing and, of course, since this is Thebeerchaser blog, let\u2019s not forget, lively and interesting eateries and watering holes in which to raise a mug.\nBased on multiple recommendations, our first night, we ate at Angel\u2019s Hollow, in a quaint old house and which not only had outstanding food (Janet said the best minestrone soup she has ever had) but an interesting bar with friendly people from all over the US.\nThey included Joe, Paul, Shannon and Len, who were drinking beer with straight shots of Jamison\u2019s as a chaser. They wanted to buy us shots and to join them \u2013 I did and Janet declined!. Angel\u2019s Hollow is also known for wonderful margaritas \u2013 understandably.\nIt\u2019s co-owned by a husband and wife. Lee, the husband is also the cook \u2013 a good one who takes no guff from unruly patrons \u2013 possibly because after attending culinary school in New York, he cooked for the Hell\u2019s Angels for several years.\nThe Breckenridge commercial area is pretty compact \u2013 and not far from the slopes \u2013 so tourists are advised to refrain not only from drinking and driving, but drinking and skiing.\nAnother nice little bar \u2013 also on Main Street \u2013 Apres Handcrafted Libations \u2013 beckoned us for a nightcap and presented a lot of choices.\nThe next night we ate at Ollie\u2019s Pub and Grub \u2013 a good brewpub with stand-out hamburgers \u2013 advertised as \u201cThe Best in Breck,\u201d \u2013 and if not, they had to be close. As usual, we sat at the bar which makes it easier to strike up conversation and met a friendly couple from Texas.\nOllies \u2013 the best burger in Breck?\nA short road trip the next day took us over the pass to Vale \u2013 which seemed more effete than the amiable village of Breckenridge and returned through Dillon. The recommendations of locals held sway and we had lunch and a beer at the Dillon Dam Brewery -opened in 1997 and now with thirteen of its own beers on tap.\nIt advertises itself (I\u2019m somewhat skeptical) as \u201cThe largest brew-pub in the Colorado Rockies\u201d \u2013 but regardless if this claim is accurate, they keep their promise of brewing \u201cDam Good Beer\u201d \u2013 most notably, the award-winning Chili Lager.\nDam Good Beer found here\u2026.\nThey have expanded from six to twelve beers and the reviews on the beer are good. We met a sister and two brothers who were on a road trip from Florida to spread their mom\u2019s ashes in the Rockies.\nQuenching the thirst of miners, skiers and residents since Rutherford B. Hayes was President!\n\u201cIn 1880, the town had eighteen saloons and three dance halls on Main Street\u2026..The number of saloons and mines began to taper off by 1910 when Breckenridge went into total hibernation.\nAnd I would suggest that although the bar with the same name on Mt. Rushmore Street in Custer, South Dakota, also has some stories to tell, the Breckenridge version has a more esteemed position in its contribution to the annals of American saloons.\nWhile it is in a clapboard building and does have some flat screen TVs and pool tables, the authentic historical trappings in the two rooms (one for the restaurant and one for the bar) of the saloon are compelling. And remember \u2013 it stayed open even during Prohibition.\nAnd perhaps the stories and conversation I heard are more contemporary then those described by Tom Noel below, but they are still engaging.\nThis compares to Dr. Noel\u2019s personal experience in the Gold Pan in the 1970\u2019s \u2013 his first visit: \u201cBefore I knew it, the shaggy, huge bartender was yelling at one of our party: \u2018You calling me a liar?  Here\u2019s your money back, all of it.'\u201d He then kicked all Noel\u2019s party out of the bar.<|endoftext|>Ideal Protein Results Presented at Cleveland Clinic and National Obesity Conferences December 1, 2014.\nFindings of an analysis of 233 patients on the Ideal protein protocol over 12 weeks were presented at the 9th Annual Scientific meeting of the National Obesity Society.

They are frequent visitors and are always looking for a handout of carrots or, maybe an apple! Sugar and Spice are jealous of them and bark at them the entire time they come to get their treats.\nPaco is the dun-colored horse on the left. The big red guy is Poncho. He is the greedy one and always pushes Paco out of the way.\nWhat lovely neighbors \u2014 I would enjoy having some as my neighbor!!\nI think Toby would be much the same as Sugar and Spice, Colleen.

But I did end up barbecuing, first the pork tenderloin and then a top sirloin that had been marinated in this beer based marinade.\nI tend to drink beer like Sam Adams or MacTarnahan\u2019s, but unlike my theory of cooking with good wine, I do use cheap beer for cooking things like Welsh Rarebit. I keep a few cans up in the cupboard that I use either in cooking or when I want to bring a beer down to the pool.\nYou can chop everything up or put it in the food processor with the beer and liquefy it.\nPut it in a glass container or plastic zippered bag with the steak and marinade in the refrigerator a few hours, turning occasionally.\nThis was not a strong marinade but I think provided a bit of flavor. It was hard for me to tell, actually. I meant to taste it but the sight of the chimichurri sauce made me lose my senses and I instantly put a bunch on my steak. And once you taste that, you have to have more.\ni tried your marinade on some thinly sliced flank steak and it was absolutely awesome. i did however find that the marinade needed some salt, i tasted it before i placed it on my steaks. i also like a stronger flavor of limes so i added 4 squeezed limes to my marinade with the lime being tossed in the bag with my meat. this was for 2lbs of meat. thank you for posting this receipe i will be using it again this weekend but with 15 lbs of beef.<|endoftext|>Can you feel it?

Moon said the government is mobilizing all its resources to recover from the damage.\nThe season's 18th typhoon hit hard on the country's eastern and southern areas, bringing heavy rains and strong winds.\nEarlier in the day, a woman in her 70s died after being swept away by strong currents in the southeastern city of Pohang.\nIn Samcheok, Gangwon Province, heavy precipitation caused a landslide, which brought down a wall of a house, killing a woman sleeping inside. A similar accident took place in the southeastern county of Yeongdeok, killing one, according to the disaster authorities.\nOn Wednesday, a 76-year-old man was killed after he was swept away by strong currents in a farming village in Seongju, North Gyeongsang Province.\nTwo people also went missing amid heavy rains, and several others suffered injuries, the authorities said, adding that more than 1,500 people on the southern island of Jeju and other southeastern regions were evacuated to emergency shelters.\nA sightseeing train in Bonghwa, North Gyeongsang Province, derailed due to a landslide and more than a dozen sections of streets were closed because of heavy rain.\nFlights returned to normal operations at 6 a.m., but 83 passenger ferries on 65 sea routes are still suspended, according to the authorities.\nThe mid-strength typhoon, the seventh to affect the Korean Peninsula this year, brought heavy rain and high winds to the southern regions even before making landfall. Several regions experienced record high levels of precipitation.\nTyphoon Mitag dumped 555.6 millimeters of rain on Uljin, North Gyeongsang Province, between midnight Tuesday and 10 a.m. on Thursday. Precipitation reached 104.5 millimeters per hour in Uljin between 00:31 a.m. and 1:30"

There is no Gaelic in its prefix or combination, to imply that it means either timber, or moss. We, therefore, can assign no Gaelic meaning to its name.\nThat part of the Upper Cabrach which is in Aberdeenshire, is bounded on the north by the Lower Cabrach, which is in Banffshire, and the parish of Rhynie; on the east by the parishes of Auchindoir and Kildrummy; on the south by the parishes of Towie and Glenbucket; and on the west by the mountains and valley of the Blackwater, which forms the upper portion of the parish, in Banffshire.\nIts greatest length from east to west, measures in a direct line 7 miles; and its greatest breadth from south to north, also in a direct line, is G\u00bd miles; and the whole area of the parish in Aberdeendire, is estimated to be about l6,680 acres.\nThe valley of the Upper Cabrach has the mountain of the Buck on the east, with his lower ridges, which trend away in the direction of the Tap O'Noth, and Huntly; on the south, are the hills bordering with Towie and Glenbucket ; and on the west lie the Banffshire frontier mountains, between the valleys of the Doveran and the Blackwater. The bridge of Kingsford, or Bridge-end, on the Doveran, which is nearer to the lowest point in the Aberdeenshire division of the parish, is 970 feet above sea level; the influx of the burn of Aultdeach, is 996 feet; and the manse of Cabrach is 1050 feet. The highest cultivated land, west of the Doveran, on Aldievalloch, is 1155 feet; that on the hill of Largue, on the east of the river, is about 1400 feet. The Buck of Cabrach is 2368 feet, the source of the Garbit, which is on the borders of Towie parish, is 1734 feet, and the source of the West Lewie, on the confines of Glenbucket, is l847 feet; this stream is considered to be the chief affluent of the Doveran, (Deveron, i.e., the double river), and after the junction of the streams of East and West Lewie, it receives the name of the Doveran. In approaching the Upper Cabrach, from Auchindoir, the road leads across the northern slopes of the Buck, along the burn of Glenny, and by the \"dead wife's cairn,\" and the Silver fords at Braidshaw, on the burn of the Buck (which is the northmost point in the parish of Kildrummy), thence to Elrick and the church of Cabrach; and by this mountainous road, the distance from Lumsden Village is full seven miles, and Lumsden is 34 miles from Aberdeen, by the Bridge of Alford. The lower road which leads from Rhynie, is steep and hilly in many parts, and rather more circuitous than the last one. This road starts from the village of Rhynie, and runs along the south-western shoulder of the Tap O'Noth, by the ruins of Lesmoir castle, Belhinny, and by the top of the water of Kirkney, to Blackmiddens and the church of Cabrach; and by it the distance from Rhynie is fully eight miles, and Rhynie is 38 miles from Aberdeen, also by the Bridge of Alford. The Doveran side road to Huntly, crosses to the west side of the river at Kingsford, which is fully one mile below the church, and continues on the west side of the valley, through the Lower Cabrach, and Glass, and near the old church of Dumbenan, the road recrosses the river to the east side, and the distance to Huntly is full 16 miles. To those who desire to explore the stilly solitudes of the Cabrach, and its true mountain scenery, we ought to say that the Auchindoir, or Lumsden Village road is barely fit for wheeled conveyances, the Rhynie road is the best of the two; and the Huntly or Doveran side road has many pleasant attractions to offer to the pedestrian explorer of the upper valleys of the Doveran; but that considerable exertions are requisite to bring him into the centre of this lonely region, where, and while he who is accustomed to say, \"here is'mine inn,'\" will, in this region of peat-earth and moist weather, find few establishments of that kind.<|endoftext|>Description A series of valves which reconfigure themselves, allowing for waste products of reactions to be reused for a variety of purposes.

The outcry would be furious.\nBut a bill is currently before the Israeli Knesset, led by a parliamentarian from the \"moderate\" Kadima party, that would bar Arab residents of East Jerusalem from working as tour guides in the city. Knesset member Gideon Ezra said it was essential tourist groups are \"accompanied by a tour guide who is an Israeli citizen and has institutional loyalty to the [Jewish] state of Israel\".\nJournalist Gideon Levy writes in the Israeli daily Haaretz that no politician \"has even begun to think of Arabs as being equal to Jews\". The Israeli Jewish public increasingly shares these authoritarian views. In a study published in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, 36 per cent of Israeli Jews urged the revoking of Arab voting rights and restriction of free speech in \"times of political difficulty\".\nThis is the Israel that Western politicians prefer to ignore. When I recently confronted Opposition Leader Tony Abbott over his blind backing for Israeli \"democracy\", he muttered something about the Middle East not being \"perfect\". But, I countered, what about Jewish-only settler roads in the West Bank? That was \"bad\", he acknowledged, before looking away nervously.\nJulia Gillard's Labor Party shares these delusions. It is one of the reasons that the Independent Australian Jewish Voices group published newspaper advertisements nationally this month demanding the Australian government \"exert pressure on Israel to conform to international law and humanitarian standards\".\nThe growing global concern over Israeli values has been crystallised by the Netanyahu cabinet voting to force non-Jews seeking citizenship to swear allegiance to Israel as a \"Jewish and democratic state\".\nThe decision was met with furious indignation from a vocal minority in Israel, not least Palestinians who were being asked to negate their historical rights. Leftist Jewish Israelis marched through Tel Aviv chanting, \"Fascism and ethnic cleansing are standing proud\".\nIn the diaspora there was virtual silence. Blind loyalty came before defending democratic values. The Achilles heel is its deference to Israeli government decisions, a Maoist-like devotion to a country increasingly delegitimised by its own occupying policies.\nOne of the main reasons the boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign is thriving around the world - alongside the one-state solution idea - is that Israel ignores global demands to change its behaviour. Cultural and economic isolation worked against apartheid South Africa.\nJust the latest example of a principled stance in reaction to the loyalty oath was the refusal of the English filmmaker Mike Leigh to participate in a program at a Jerusalem film school. He also cited expanding West Bank settlements and the brutal attack on the Gaza flotilla.\nLeigh was praised by the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel for highlighting \"the fact that collaborating with institutions of a state that practises occupation, colonisation and apartheid, as Israel does, cannot be regarded as a neutral act....\"\nNo other Western state has tried to introduce anything like the loyalty oath. The oath is on an ever-growing list of anti-democratic proposals before the Knesset, including a one-year prison term for \"incitement for the negation of the existence of the state of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state\".\nNo obfuscation about the supposedly devilish plans of Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran or al-Qaeda can distract from the reality of Israel's inherent racism. The world should stop pumping in funds to perpetuate the infrastructure of oppression.<|endoftext|>Vintage Horse Tie Clip, Horseman Clip, Vintage Stratton Tie Clip, Horse Jewellery, Horse Tie Clip, Vintage Tie Clip, Equestrian Jewellery.\nFantastic vintage stylish Gold tie/scarf clip is made and stamped by the very collectible Stratton.\nThe clip is in the shape of a horse and Jockey design with divine quality.

They hold all the money and power. If you were just a peasant, you pretty much just work hard to keep food on the table, keep your head down and don't get into trouble with the powerful. There were many restrictions. Peasants were not allowed to wear certain clothing items, in case people mistaken you as a noble. I have heard that in medieval time, it is only nobleman can carry sword in public during peace time, with exception if you are traveller, merchant who will encounter danger during travel. Later on, it is the gentleman can bear light arms like rapier. Back then the word \"gentleman\" refers to people who came from \"good\" family but not necessary noble. Not just a regular poor sob.\nAmerica was a land of revolutionary ideas. It is not surprising given its independence comes from rebel against the ruling of Imperial Britain. One of the idea the founding fathers came out was, anyone, no matter you are noble or peasant, can own arms. In fact, you take your gun and join or form a militia of you liking, without having to knee in front of a king to swear loyalty to or get knighted.\nWhat I think about the second amendment, the very spirit is meant to be a rebellion against the old European tradition and value of that time.\nIn those days, if I want the ability to self defence, a hand gun or a simple rifle will serve me well. Even if I want to join a local militia, I doubt there are more complicated equipment than a cannon. Almost three hundred years later, it really depends on what I want to self defence against. If I am worried about an insane person taking a semi-automatic to my company and start firing, I am not sure a hand gun is sufficient. If I were a minority and think the local police is corrupted. Well, the police in US often get surplus military gears. So what should I get to protect myself? A howitzer? kamikaze drone? Tank? Well, second amendment allows me to bear arms, and arms doesn't mean only gun. In theory, I should be allowed to buy ICBM or even nuke if I have the money. The whole idea of second amendment is I don't have to knee before a king and all that jazz to get weapon. So I shouldn't need to be enlisted to get my hands on ICBM, or get elected as US president to touch that nuke button.\nOften I feel that we have to revisit what was purpose of the second amendment and how does it serves us in the modern days. As of 2022, I view the spirit of it as everyone should have the right and the means to self-defence. What are the equipment adequate for self-defence, and if something can be done to reduce threats in public space thus reduce the need of self-defence should be up for debate.\nSadly, each of the interest groups tend to fight for their own narrow interest and belief, so all these debate end up nowhere. After every mass shooting, there would be some of the debate, but nothing really change.\nI have no good idea on how this problem can be solved. I wish that there is a solution. Very few Americans are gun-blazing nut jobs. I believe a lot of them would rather living in peace, except they may not have the luxury to.<|endoftext|>A powerful typhoon damaged buildings, flooded roads and knocked out power to thousands of homes in South Korea on Monday after battering islands in southern Japan, killing one person and injuring dozens of others.\nSeoul: A powerful typhoon damaged buildings, flooded roads and knocked out power to thousands of homes in South Korea on Monday after battering islands in southern Japan, killing one person and injuring dozens of others.\nThe Korea Meteorological Administration said Typhoon Haishen was passing over waters off the eastern coastal city of Sokcho on Monday afternoon after barreling through South Korea\u2019s southern and eastern regions.\nThe typhoon was weakening, with its maximum winds measured at 108 kilometers (67 miles) per hour after blowing at 144 kilometers (80 miles) in the morning, and was forecast to be downgraded to a tropical storm within six hours.\nIn South Korea, more than 100 homes were destroyed or flooded, while cars struggled to navigate flooded roads in Ulsan and other coastal cities such as Busan, Sokcho and Gangneung. Emergency workers scrambled to clean up toppled trees and damaged traffic signs, buildings, port facilities and other structures.\nAt least one person was missing after getting swept away by water that filled a drainage channel at a limestone mine in the eastern coastal town of Samcheok. Another person was found dead in Busan, but officials said it wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether the death was caused by the typhoon.\nHundreds of flights in and out of the southern island province of Jeju and across the mainland were canceled. Some bridges and railroad sections were shut down, thousands of fishing boats and other vessels were moved to safety, and more than 2,600 residents in the southern mainland regions were evacuated due to the possibility of landslides and other concerns.\nWorkers as of Monday afternoon had restored power to 49,643 of the 75,237 households that lost electricity in the southern mainland areas and Jeju.<|endoftext|>Match Notes From Final X Stillwater!\nAll the action from Final X Stillwater, presented"

I was leaving my favorite national park. I was also leaving my home country. Onward to Canada! The home of the very very nice people. And the Red Green Show. If you don\u2019t know what the Red Green Show is youtube it. I have not checked but I bet you can find it all over it. It was in my top 5 shows to watch growing up. Well anyways it turned out I left my camera in night exposure mode so I have a bunch of pictures that just resemble the great white north about 3 months ago. As I left Glacier National Park. I quickly returned to the prairies of Montanan and as I headed towards Canada the mountains appeared to e getting further and further away. As soon as crossed the border into Canada the ranch lands turned into farmland with this beautiful yellow floor covering the landscape as far as you could see. I kept driving on towards Calgary where I would meet up with the T-CAT (Trans Canadian Adventure Trail). About 100km away from Calgary I was driving into what appeared to be a nasty thunder storm. All of a sudden I hit it it started to down pour. Next came the dime size hail for the next 30mins. I kept trekking onward slowly with traffic as it seemed I could reach the other edge sooner than it would pass. I soon reached the other side and was quickly into Calgary. Calgary had worst traffic then I expected and since I don\u2019t have the detailed road maps of Canada for my gps. I was just following a line. After about a hr and a half I was through Calgary and approaching my turn off for the T-CAT. I soon reached that turn off and headed down some nice gravel roads between farm land and cow pastures. For the rest of the day I was in and out of rain clouds. After a few more hour of driving the pasture stared to turn into pine forest. And I past a sign about a recreational area I was headed into. Within an hour of passing that sign I was reaching my camping spot for the night. As I turned off the main road towards the camping spot the rain let up and I was a creek so I got out and took a look. This is what I saw.\nAs there was a campfire ring but signs clearly stating that there is no camping allowed in that area. I headed down the road away from that beautiful spot. I soon reached the area were camping was allowed and found a spot nestled back into a pine forest a short distance from the road. I am calling it an early night since last night was so late and I was unable to get much sleep.\nDay 52 (7/14): Today started off as an early one. I guess the sleeping in period is over. So I hit the gravel road. The roads were real nice and smooth with the occasional washboard. For the first half of the day I was driving through the pine forests with the mountains to my right and I was approaching them.\nI soon reached a little town and headed up into the mountains and was surrounded by them.\nI continued down the gravel road through the mountain passes. When you picture the Rocky Mountains or see a post card of them It is from the Canadian"

The province is also crossed by the 145-km-long Military Demarcation Line (MDL), which starts at 38\u00b045' north latitude, in Hyeonnae-myeon in Goseong-gun to the southwest, to a site at 38\u00b020' north latitude linking Hyangnobong Peak, Mondong-ri and Gimhwa-eup. Gangwon-do is 150 km wide, from east to west, and 243 km long, from north to south, and has an eastern coastline of about 314 km. The province is bordered by five provinces, three cities and 13 counties, including Singye-gun and Gimcheon-gun in Hwanghae-do; Yeoncheon, Pocheon, Gapyeong, Yangpyeong and Yeoju in Gyeonggi-do in the east; Chungju-si, Jecheon-si and Danyang-gun in Chungcheongbuk-do and Yeongju-si, Bonghwa-gun and Uljin-gun in Gyeongsangbuk-do in the south; and Anbyeon-gun and Deogwon-gun in Hamgyeongnam-do and Goksan-gun in Hwanghae-do in the north.\nThe total area of Gangwon-do is 20,569Km\u00b2 of which the area south of the MDL is 16,873.51\u33a2, which accounts for 82% of the province's total area and 16.8% of the national territory of South Korea.\nThe total area of Gangwon-do is 20,569Km\u00b2 of which the area south of the MDL is 16,873.51\u33a2, which accounts for 82% of the province's total area and 16.8% of the national territory of South Korea. The province consists of the mountainous areas covering 81.0% of the total provincial area, including 13,665.66Km\u00b2 and farming fields of 1,668.69Km\u00b2, which accounts for 9.9%, and land for other purposes covering 9.1% of the total area, with 1,539.25Km\u00b2.\nGangwon-do is a mountainous province, (a much greater part is occupied by mountains)and is usually divided into two areas, Yeongdong and Yeongseo, with the Taebaek Mountains, which form the backbone of the Korean Peninsula, in the middle.\nThe area east of the Taebaek Mountains is marked by steep slopes with few coastal plains, while the western area is marked by gentle slopes and mountains containing the headwaters of some of Korea's largest rivers, such as the Namhan and Bukhan Rivers.\nThe percentage of low land (less than 100 meters high) covers only 5.6% of the total area of Gangwon-do, which is even lower than that of Hamgyeongnam-do where the figure is 9.6%. Low hills between 100-500 meters in height cover 43.1%; mid-height land between 500-1,000 meters covers 43.4%, a larger figure than for all the other provinces in Korea; and, finally, highlands taller than 1,000 meters cover 7.7%. Flat, arable land for paddy cultivation is largely located along the eastern coastal area around Gangneung and Bukpyeong and is distributed around Cheorwon, Chuncheon and Wonju in the Yeongbuk area. The northern part of the river basins feature steep valleys.\nThe Yeongdong area is geographically narrow due to the steep mountains facing the East Sea, but it contains several high scenic passes, such as Daegwallyeong, Misiryeong, Jinburyeong and Hangyeryeong, and deep valleys. The Yeongseo area features mountains and sunken lands all running gently towards Seoul and surrounding Gyeonggi-do in the west, and expansive highlands that offer dry fields rather than paddies and contain headwaters that flow into many streams and two of Korea's largest rivers, the Han River and Nakdong River, that wet a large part of the Korean Peninsula. The upper streams of the Bukhan River provide habitats for various fish species, including some of the rarest Korean native fish, and form well protected healthy ecosystems. There are in the area several famous dams: the Peace Dam, Hwacheon Dam, Chuncheon Dam, Soyang River Dam and Uiam Dam that supply an ample amount of water for Korean industries and daily life.\nGangwon-do is located in the medium-latitude temperate zone between 37\u00b0 and 38\u00b0 north latitude.\nLocated in the medium-latitude temperate zone between 37\u00b0 and 38\u00b0 north latitude, Gangwon-do's climate is characterized by high temperatures and humidity during the summer and coldness and dryness in the winter. This is due to the high continental pressure which is low in temperature and humidity.\nGangwon-do is geographically divided into two areas, Yeongdong and Yeongseo, by the Taebaek Mountains as they stretch from north to south along the east of the Korean Peninsula. Both areas feature remarkably different climatic conditions.\nAs for the general characteristics of the province's climate, the Yeongdong area, in which steep mountain slopes are directly connected with the coasts, displays elements of an oceanic climate whereas the Yeongseo area, located in the middle of the Korean Peninsula, shows characteristic elements comparable to those of a continental climate. Meanwhile, the highlands of the Taebaek Mountains exhibit characteristic features of a mountain climate.\nThe Yeongdong area has a few paddy fields because of the steep mountain slopes running downwards and directly into the sea, thus leaving only a limited area of paddy fields lying along some parts of the coastline. Such geographical features of the area create a comparatively warmer winter and cooler summer, with a low annual temperature range.\nThe annual mean temperature in the Yeongdong area is higher than that of the Yeongseo area by 2\u00b0 C. The annual precipitation rates in the two areas are 2,058.5mm and 1,690.3mm, respectively, showing that Gangwon-do's eastern part, including Gangneung, Sokcho and Samcheok, has more rainfall (by about 370 mm annually) than the western part, which includes Chuncheon, Wonju and Cheorwon. In the winter and spring the province tends to have stronger winds than in other provinces. There is also more snow in winter. In January and February the Yeongdong area, in particular, tends to have a much heavier snowfall than the rest of the entire country.<|endoftext|>SciVal solution trial access is open at TalTech until 30th November 2018.\nAccess is granted from TalTech`s IP addresses, but in order to log-in you have to create an account with SciVal according to the guidelines.\nIf you have already an account for accessing Scopus, ScienceDirect or Mendeley \u2013 it will work here as well.\nSciVal enables you to visualize research performance, benchmark relative to peers, develop collaborative partnerships and analyze research trends.

Some 98 percent of working climate scientists agree that the atmosphere is already warming in response to human greenhouse-gas emissions, and the most recent research suggests that we are on a path toward what were once considered \u201cworst case\u201d scenarios.\nThat chipper sentiment marks the beginning of my new piece for Popular Science. It\u2019s an introduction/scene-setter for their recent issue, which has a package of pieces focused on climate adaptation in shelter, food, water, and more. Go read the whole thing!\nThere won\u2019t be much new material in it for my 12 loyal readers, especially those who have read my \u201cbrutal logic\u201d posts or watched my TEDx talk. It\u2019s all that ol\u2019 doom-and-gloom, again.\nThere is no amount of mitigation now available to us that would eliminate the need for adaptation. If we\u2019re smart, we may be able to do enough adaptation to avoid most of the suffering. Adaptation, or \u201cruggedizing\u201d as I prefer to call it, is something humanity has always done, but it will consume more and more of our time and resources in coming decades.\nI fear some people have it in their heads that adaptation will be cheaper than mitigation, that unlike mitigation it will happen naturally, through the wonders of human intrepidity and the magic of capitalism. After all, \u201cwith the notable exception of climate, there is little reason to assume that other conditions that characterized the Holocene are particularly important to human material welfare.\u201d So why worry?\nBut human cultures and human infrastructure are not an economist\u2019s spreadsheet in which variables can be adjusted without friction. Adaptation will be brutally difficult. It will be much, much costlier than mitigation. We should be under no illusions. We\u2019re stuck with some of it, but we should still avoid as much as possible.\nOne final point: Mitigation and adaptation spending are not equivalent. Mitigation spending will go to new energy systems, new public transit systems, new agricultural systems. It will yield innovation, higher productivity, new jobs, and improved quality of life. It\u2019s like paying for your kid to go to college or building a factory for your business \u2014 the high upfront costs yield substantial long-term returns, paying themselves back many times over. Mitigation spending is investment.\nSo: it\u2019s mitigation, adaptation, and/or suffering. Some of the latter two are unavoidable, but if we care about the health and well-being of our descendents, we\u2019ll maximize the first, starting today.<|endoftext|>Come rain or shine, we'll roll on our paddleboard.

For the county in North Chungcheong, see Yeongdong County.\nYeongdong (Korean pronunciation: [j\u028c\u014b.do\u014b], Korean pronunciation: [\u027ej\u0254\u014b.d\u0264\u014b], literally 'east of the passes') is the eastern, coastal region of Gangwon Province, South Korea and Kangw\u014fn Province, North Korea. It is divided from the inland Yeongseo region by the Taebaek Mountains.\nAlthough Yeongseo describes the western half of the two provinces and Gwandong describes both halves together, \"Yeongdong\" is used much more frequently in South Korea than either of the other two names, and may be taken loosely to refer to the entire region.\nThe region's name lends itself to the Yeongdong Railway Line and Yeongdong Expressway, which are major transportation corridors connecting Seoul to Gangwon.\nThis Korea location article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.\nGangneung is a municipal city in the province of Gangwon-do, on the east coast of South Korea. It has a population of 213,658. Gangneung is the economic centre of the Yeongdong region of Gangwon-do. Gangneung has many tourist attractions, such as Jeongdongjin, a very popular area for watching the sun rise, and Gyeongpo Beach. There is an ROKAF airbase south of downtown Gangneung that formerly doubled as a civil airport.\nGangwon-do is a province of South Korea, with its capital at Chuncheon. It is bounded on the east part by the Sea of Japan, and borders Gyeonggi Province to its west, and North Gyeongsang Province and North Chungcheong Province to its south. Its northern boundary is the Military Demarcation Line, separating it from North Korea's Kangw\u014fn Province. Before the division of Korea in 1945 Gangwon and Kangw\u014fn formed a single province. Pyeongchang County hosted the 2018 Winter Olympics and 2018 Winter Paralympics. Gangwon will host the 2024 Winter Youth Olympics.\nGyeongsang was one of the eight provinces of Korea during the Joseon dynasty. Gyeongsang was located in the southeast of Korea.\nDonghae is a city in Gangwon Province, South Korea. There are two major ports: Donghae Harbor and Mukho Harbor. The city is located on the Yeongdong Line railroad and the Donghae Expressway. Numerous caverns are found in the city, as in neighboring Samcheok. Hanzhong University is located here.\nPyeongchang is a county in the province of Gangwon-do, South Korea, located in the Taebaek Mountains region. It is home to several Buddhist temples, including Woljeongsa. It is about 180 km (110 mi) east southeast of Seoul, the capital of South Korea, and connected by expressways and high-speed passenger railways. Pyeongchang's slogan, \"Happy 700 Pyeongchang\", is taken from its average elevation of approximately 700 metres (2,300 ft).\nYeongnam is a region that coincides with the former Gyeongsang Province in what is now South Korea.\nA number of Korean dialects are spoken on the Korean Peninsula. The peninsula is extremely mountainous and each dialect's \"territory\" corresponds closely to the natural boundaries between different geographical regions of Korea. Most of the dialects are named for one of the traditional Eight Provinces of Korea. One is sufficiently distinct from the others to be considered a separate language, the Jeju language.\nThe Yeongdong Line is a line of Korail. It connects Yeongju in North Gyeongsang Province with Gangneung in Gangwon Province. From Yeongju, it crosses the Taebaek Mountains and reaches the Sea of Japan at Donghae, thence proceeding north to Gangneung.\nMukho is a harbor in Donghae City, Gangwon Province, South Korea. It is located on the shore of the East Sea. In the past it played an important role in the shipping of iron ore and coal; much of this role has been taken over by Donghae Harbor in recent years. Mukho is an important harbor of refuge and home to a large number of fishing vessels. A passenger ferry operates from the port to Ulleung Island. The harbor is connected to land-based transportation by two stations on the Yeongdong Line and an interchange on the Donghae Expressway. The ship Mangyongbong 92 carrying a 140 person delegation for the 2018 Winter Olympics from North Korea berthed at this harbor, as protesters opposing North Korea subsequently gathered singing Aegukga. The harbor first opened in 1941.\nGangwon Province or Gangwon-do was one of the Eight Provinces of Korea during the Joseon Dynasty. The province was formed in 1395, and derived its name from the names of the principal cities of Gangneung and the provincial capital Wonju.\nThis is a partial list of Korea-related topics beginning with Y.\nSangji University (\uc0c1\uc9c0\ub300\ud559\uad50) is a private university located in Wonju, Gangwon Province, South Korea. Established in 1955, it has seven colleges and six graduate schools. Its top areas of study are Oriental Medicine and Tourism. The Sangji Foundation also manages Sangji Yeongseo College and Sangji Girls Middle and High Schools.\nDaegwallyeong is a mountain pass in the Taebaek Mountains of eastern South Korea. It runs between Pyeongchang and Gangneung in Gangwon Province. It rises to 832 metres (2,730 ft) above sea level. It is an important historical pass that connects the regions of Yeongseo and Yeongdong. Daegwallyeong-myeon of Pyeongchang County is named after this pass. Daegwallyeong Museum is located in Gangneung.\nDonghae station is a railway station in Donghae City in Gangwon Province, South Korea. Donghae station is on the Yeongdong Line, the Samcheok Line, the Mukhohang Line, and the Bukpyeong Line.\nThe Gangwon dialect is spoken in South Korea's Gangwon Province and in North Korea's Kangw\u014fn Province. Although they are large provinces by area, relatively few people lived in the Gangwon Province. As a result, people living in the western side of Gangwon (Yeongseo) did not develop a highly distinctive dialect. However, the part of Gang"

        "passage": " offers built-in storage, large cabinets or drawers. If you don\u2019t have an island, you can buy a mobile kitchen cart, island or utility table to give you some flexibility and surface area. In fact, there\u2019s a wide range of compact wheeled storage containers ideal for corralling collections of items in one place. Carts are easy to move, so they can be rolled out for use or tucked away as needed.\nThe right table Depending on the space you have available, you can think of interesting solutions whether it\u2019s a small breakfast table or creating a separate dining spot.\nAccessorize once you have the right furniture in place. A few well-chosen and attractive accessories can prevent the kitchen from becoming bland and lonely. For example, match copper pots and block knife holders with stainless carts or add wooden touches to a rustic kitchen.\nChoosing a mattress There is no universal \u201cbest\u201d mattress, as everyone\u2019s sleep experience is unique. The best bet is to try out a mattress in person to see how it feels. Many stores, even online, have trial period and reasonable return policies.\nBed frame If you already have a mattress you love, choosing a new bed frame becomes a bit easier. Make sure you get the correct frame for your mattress size (queen size for queen size, etc.). Make sure you know whether your king-size mattress is a California king or an eastern king, as they\u2019re slightly different; a bed frame that fits one may not fit the other.\nPlatform vs. box spring? With many platform beds, you need only a mattress and no box spring; this makes platform beds easier on the budget. Some platform beds can also accommodate a box spring if you like your bed a little higher off the ground.\nA roomy bedside table with drawers or doors allows you to hide items such as books, lotion and reading glasses. For more storage, choose a skirted table or a small dresser with drawers.\nA trunk or a storage bench at the foot of the bed can be used to store extra sheets, blankets and pillows.\nThe smaller the closet, the more difficult it is to stay organized. But there are lots of organizational tools and styling tricks that can help.\nAdd storage under clothes if you\u2019re cramped on space. Place a small dresser and shoe rack beneath your hanging clothes. The top of the dresser can hold accessories, like hats or jewelry.\nShelf dividers can be used to keep baskets of sweaters or stacks of shoes intact. The sides let you stack piles higher without fear of your sweaters toppling over and ending up on the ground.\nShoe organizers are handy for your sneakers, and they can also be used for bulky items such as sweaters that you don\u2019t want to accidentally stretch out on a hanger. Rolling them up into baskets is a great solution.\nHang your accessories by using hooks (even shower hooks work) for hanging purses in your closet on the hanger rod.\nMaximize storage and declutter by adding pull-out drawers that sort items easily into a cabinet\u2014an easy weekend upgrade. Floating wall shelving, wall-mounted baskets and a small storage cabinet can also help.\n Don\u2019t be afraid to make a splash. Choose a design that appeals to your personal style and builds a cohesive aesthetic in the bathroom. An eye-catching shower rod and rings can also make a statement.\nPull the room together with coordinating bath rugs/mats and towels, and a unique or contemporary laundry basket or hamper.\nAccessorize! Don\u2019t forget the smaller items that everyone can see: Items such as a bathroom set for holding toothbrushes and soap, and a trash can, can be coordinated and give an interesting aesthetic.\nPurchase multifunctional furniture: For example, versatile pieces that can double as storage, such as a hollow ottoman or a bed with drawers underneath.\nUse unused space to your advantage: Think about unused corners and blank walls. If you have some windows in your tiny living room, use windowsills to hold books, plants and other decorative objects.\nStore vertically: Utilize vertical areas to get items off the floor and create space. Floor-to-ceiling shelving gets items off the floor and creates a spaciousness without increasing the floor square footage. Stacking containers and pantry bins also are ways to accomplish this.\nReflect on mirrors: When used as wall d\u00e9cor, mirrors can amplify light and create the illusion that a room is larger than it is. Try making a statement with decorative frames or even making a gallery wall.\nPut out plants: Whether they\u2019re the hanging variety or in cute pots on your windowsill, plants really bring life into your rental home.\nDraperies that dazzle: Draperies are the quickest way to add instant height to any space. The trick is to hang them from where your wall meets your ceiling and let them slightly pool on the ground.\nHang statement art: A large-scale piece can add a focal point to the design scheme and is another way to showcase your aesthetic.\nLayer to add depth: Create depth through layering, such as covering your bedding with multiple blankets and throw pillows. Remember that layering is not just about piling one design element on top of another; it\u2019s also about creating contrast. Go for pieces that have varying materials, textures and patterns.\nGive white walls splashes of bold color: Where large expanses of bright or dark colors tend to overwhelm a small space, pops of bold, vivacious color throughout an otherwise white or neutral space add style and personality.\nUse room dividers: Curtains, sliding doors, or even taller furniture set on casters keep a small space flexible. When you want things to feel more open, you can remove them. But if you need a minute of privacy, close them up.\nShopping for furniture online is not only a breeze, but it can be fun. With a quick Google search, you can find plenty of options for browsing furniture online, reading consumer reviews, digging into specifications, and comparing prices. Many retailers offer discounted or free shipping on online orders. Do your homework before buying to make sure you find the best furniture option for your space and your budget.\nNow that you have some decorating tips, don\u2019t forget to protect all your belongings. Renters insurance covers the associated costs if you experience a covered loss. The amount covered will depend on the type of loss that occurred and the amount of coverage you have. Make sure your home sweet home is covered!\nThe post 7 Apartment Decorating Ideas When Buying Furniture Online appeared first on Now from Nationwide \u00ae.<|endoftext|>For nearly 150 years, the public utility AMB has supplied Bellinzona, the capital of Ticino, with its power and communication.

The fire safety technology center will research and develop efficient extinguishing systems for fires lit by large-capacity secondary batteries, also known as rechargeable batteries, used in energy storage systems. Battery fires are devastating and hard to put out. During the last few years, South Korea's emergency workers adopted fire-proof blankets to cover and suffocate electric vehicle fires.\nAn energy storage system (ESS) is an integrated system of secondary battery packs. It is normally connected to a renewable energy source such as a solar power plant or a wind farm to collect electricity and provide power to nearby towns' power grids or sell electricity back to power companies. South Korea has some 2,300 energy storage system (ESS) facilities operated by private and state power companies as of July 2020 and about 30 of them have been damaged by fire and left inoperable. According to Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO), 30,232 megawatt-hours of electricity worth 6.5 billion won was lost as of 2019.\nSouth Korea has been focusing on various fire suppression methods to extinguish fire caused by batteries. Samsung SDI, the battery-making unit of tech giant Samsung Electronics, has developed a special fire extinguishing system for facilities that store electricity generated by clean energy power plants in 2019. When an ESS' interior catches fire and its temperature reaches a certain degree, special chemicals are automatically sprayed to extinguish the initial flame.\nSamcheok said in a statement on October 27 that the city started the construction of a fire safety verification center with a total width of 6,000 square meters. A 30 megawatt-class fire calorimeter and a large fire extinguishing performance test device will be used at the facility. The center will be built by August 2022. \"Samcheok will be reborn as South Korea's top energy and disaster suppression city,\" Samcheok Mayor Kim Yang-ho was quoted as saying. According to Kim, the size of South Korea's medium and large ESS test and certification market is about 10 billion won.<|endoftext|>Tess has over 13 years post-qualification experience gained both in private practice and in house, specialising in commercial law and intellectual property law.

The whistle-blower\u2019s revelations that the United States\u2019 National Security Agency has been harvesting the personal data of private EU citizens set the continent on edge. The European Court of Justice\u2019s October 2015 ruling invalidating Safe Harbor - a collective 'you-have-our-word' agreement that previously governed EU-US data transfers - rocked Europe on its data heels.\nIn February 2016, the European Commission tried to allay anxieties by announcing the proposed EU-US Privacy Shield as the new governing regulation over EU and US personal data transfers.\n\"For the first time ever,\" Commissioner Vera Jourova said, '\"the United States has given the EU binding assurances that the access of public authorities for national security purposes will be subject to clear limitations, safeguards, and oversight mechanisms.\"\nHoles in the privacy shield?\nYet many remain uneasy. First, the Privacy Shield won\u2019t be formally signed until late spring or early summer; the larger body of data law, the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is at least two years away from formal approval.\nBut the ambiguity of dates pales in comparison to the ambiguity of language and intention.

The field's output of low-calorie gas could stop in the next three years. While GasTerra still has long-term supply contracts with Italian Eni and German Uniper to honour, the last of which expires in 2029, delivering the right gas quality is the responsibility of state-owned Gasunie, which has been investing in nitrogen injection facilities. The gas from other Dutch fields is marketed by other companies as well as GasTerra.\nThe US major and the Anglo-Dutch major are also the sole shareholders in NAM, licensee of the giant Groningen field, where gas production has led to serious structural damage to houses in the region.\nGasTerra said the economy minister Eric Wiebes had informed the Dutch parliament, and its own employees have been informed. \"The phasing-out plan seeks to ensure that GasTerra can, in the coming period, continue to contribute towards a responsible reduction in gas production from the Groningen field and also fulfil its long-term obligations. A redundancy scheme will be set up for the company's employees, numbering around 165.\n\"GasTerra plays a pivotal role in the Dutch gas supply and gas market. Although GasTerra is entering a time during which it will be scaling back operations, it will do its utmost to ensure its core tasks are performed properly. The company's contractual obligations will be fulfilled. GasTerra will also continue, for the time being, all its social, cultural and energy-transition-related activities in the town and province of Groningen,\" it said.<|endoftext|>import React from \"react\";\n\nconst UserProfile = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>This is the user profile page</h1>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default UserProfile;<|endoftext|>Thanks to the Motability scheme, we at Richmond are able to offer an excellent choice of Motability cars available with no advance payment.

Without doing any research whatsoever, we packed up all of our full-sized gear (meant for car camping), stuffed it in our school bags and held the rest under our arms and in our hands.

Since many of my clients are older and have acquired valuable assets, a pre-nuptial agreement is a means of clarifying marital expectations such as how expenses are to be paid, how assets are to be distributed after someone dies, and whether the new spouse will receive an inheritance. In this scenario a pre-nuptial agreement can be a significant estate planning legal tool.\nWhen entering into a pre-nuptial agreement, you will have to fully disclose all of your assets and income to the other party. The agreement must be in writing and each party must have an opportunity to have legal representation.\nThere are many issues to address in a pre-nuptial agreement, but let me list a few of the common ones: What happens if the newly married couple purchases a home together? How will it be titled? What happens to the home when one of the spouses dies? If one party sells their home and moves in with the other party, what protection does the spouse have if the spouse who owns the home dies?\nAs you go forward in your life together, tangible personal property such as furniture, artwork and electronics must be considered and their ownership documented. It is important to catalogue family heirlooms so those items can be returned to the family from which they originated.\n401(k)s and other retirement plans must be handled separately. In fact, you cannot establish your right to a 401(k) in a pre-nuptial agreement. It must be addressed when you are a spouse. Often when I prepare a pre-nuptial agreement, I will also prepare a post-nuptial agreement to deal with the retirement plans.\nA word of caution: If your spouse goes into a nursing home, a pre-nuptial agreement will not protect your assets. If you are married you must use your assets to care for your spouse even if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place. It is important to determine how long-term care expenses will be paid. Does your future spouse have enough assets to pay for their care? Do they own long-term care insurance? These questions must be answered to ensure your long term financial security.\nAs you can see, a pre-nuptial agreement takes time and consideration, but can give both spouses peace of mind for their future together.<|endoftext|>I discovered the Veeam Cloud Details Administration recognition VMCA exam on VMCAv1 expertise focus-obtaining, so I\u2019ll talk about a few things i stumbled upon throughout the expectations of lowering any fears/problems you might have.

The move, announced on 2 May, is part of an ongoing effort to make obtaining grants easier for early- and mid-career scientists, who face much tougher odds than their more-experienced colleagues.\n\u201cBecause scientific discovery is inherently unpredictable, there are reasons to believe that supporting more researchers working on a diversity of biomedical problems, rather than concentrating resources in a smaller number of labs, might maximize the number of important discoveries that can emerge from the science we support,\u201d NIH director Francis Collins wrote in a blogpost. In doing so, he added, the policy could improve \u201creturns on taxpayers\u2019 investments\u201d.\nAccording to the agency, just 10% of grant recipients win 40% of the agency\u2019s research money. Advocacy organizations and groups that advise the NIH director have been urging the agency to address this inequality for more than a decade. They are also concerned that increasing competition for grant money drives researchers to spend more time on paperwork and personnel issues associated with grants, and less time in the lab.\nThe latest NIH policy does not set a hard limit on the number of grants or the dollar amount of funding that an individual researcher can receive \u2014 an acknowledgement that some topics are inherently more expensive than others to study. Rather, Collins says, the agency will introduce a metric called the Grant Support Index (GSI), which assigns a point value to each type of grant on the basis of its complexity and size.\nResearchers will be limited to 21 points\u2019 worth of funding \u2014 the equivalent of three R01 grants, the most common type awarded to individuals \u2014 at a time. Researchers with more than 21 points who are seeking an extra grant will need to explain to the NIH how their existing grants can be adjusted to accommodate the new one and so stay under the point limit.\nCollins expects the policy to free up 1,600 new awards while affecting only 6% of NIH-funded investigators whose current grants would exceed the new limit. The NIH will determine how to implement the point system \u201cover the next few months\u201d, he says, after consulting its advisory councils and the broader scientific community.\nHoward Garrison, deputy executive director for policy at the Federation of American Societies for"

The parasites transmitted by Haemaphysalis spp. are Theileria spp., Babesia spp., and Hepatozoon spp. which likewise cause the following diseases, respectively: tropical theileriosis and sheep theilerosis; cattle, dog, and sheep babesiosis; and hepatozoonosis [7].\nDespite the importance of H. longicornis as an important pathogen vector, little is known regarding its microbiome. In this study, we employed high-throughput sequencing of the V3\u2013V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene to investigate the bacterial abundance and diversity between the nymph stage and the adult developmental stages of H. longicornis to evaluate the changes in the bacterial abundance and the maintenance of the bacterial community throughout the life cycle of the tick.\nTicks were collected within a radius of 50 m from vegetation (geographical location: 37.323366/129.233736) by flagging in Samcheok, Gangwon-do Province, Korea, in June 2020. Species identification of the collected ticks was performed by examination under a dissecting microscope, according to Yamaguti et al. [8]. Among the 140 H. longicornis obtained, 11 nymphs, 3 female adults, and 4 male adults were randomly selected for microbiome study.\nThe surface of each tick was sterilized using alcohol before DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from individual ticks using a NucleoSpin DNA Insect kit (Macherey\u2013Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nThe V3\u2013V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR using the following bacterial universal primer pair: forward primer, 5\u2032-TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3\u2032 and reverse primer, 5\u2032-GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3\u2032 [9]. A limited-cycle amplification step was performed to add multiplexing indices and Illumina sequencing adapters. The libraries were normalized, pooled, and sequenced using the MiSeq platform (600 cycles, Illumina MiSeq V3 cartridge; Illumina, San Diego, California, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nBioinformatic analyses were performed as described by Kim et al. [9]. Raw reads were processed through a quality check, and low-quality (Q <25) reads were filtered using Trimmomatic 0.32 [10]. Paired-end sequence data were then merged using PandaSeq [11]. Primers were trimmed using the ChunLab in-house program (ChunLab, Inc., Seoul, Korea), applying a similarity cut-off of 0.8. Sequences were denoised using the Mothur pre-clustering program, which merges sequences and extracts unique sequences, allowing up to 2 differences between sequences [12]. The EzBioCloud database [13] was used for taxonomic assignment using BLAST 2.2.22 [14], and pairwise alignments were generated to calculate similarity [15]. The UCHIME algorithm and non-chimeric 16S rRNA database from EzBioCloud were used to detect chimeric sequences for reads with a best hit similarity rate of <97% [16]. Sequence data were then clustered using CD-Hit and UCLUST [17,18]. All of the abovementioned analyses were performed with EzBioCloud, a commercially available ChunLab bioinformatics cloud platform for microbiome research (https://www.ezbiocloud.net/). The reads were normalized to 10,000 to perform the analyses. We computed the Shannon index [19], unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) clustering [20], and principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) [21] based on the generalized UniFrac distance [22]. We used the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test to test for differences in the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and used the Shannon index to compare microbiome diversity between the 2 age groups. We used linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis to identify significantly different taxa [23]. Swarm plot was created by the beeswarm package in R software (version 4.0.5).\nFor H. longicornis nymph, female adult, and male adult ticks, the average reads assigned to bacteria were 35,622, 59,365, and 51,859, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). The number of OTUs, which reflects species richness, was not significantly different between the groups (Fig. 1A, B; Supplementary Table S1). The Shannon index, which reflects species diversity, was significantly higher for nymphs (n=11) than the adult ticks (both males and females, n=7; P=0.026; Fig. 1C). However, it did not differ significantly among the 3 groups, and the average Shannon indices were 1.55, 0.83, and 0.78 for nymphs (n=11), female adults (n=3), and male adult (n=4) ticks, respectively (Fig. 1D; Supplementary Table S1).\nBeta diversity was analyzed to show the difference in bacterial composition between the samples. First, the PCoA result showed that the samples of the male adult group and those of the female adult group clustered well (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the bacterial composition of the 2 groups was different. In contrast, nymph samples were relatively scattered in the plot versus the other groups. Similarly, in UPGMA clustering, the male adult and female adult samples were clustered closely among their groups than the nymph samples.\nIn the composition, the most predominant bacterial species was Pseudomonas fulva, which was found in all ticks evaluated in this study with an average relative abundance of 48.9% (Fig. 3A, B). The second most abundant species was Coxiella-like bacterium (AB001519), a known tick endosymbiont [24], with an average relative abundance of 20.7% (Fig. 3A). Coxiella-like bacterium (AB001519) was found in all nymphs and female adult ticks although some nymph samples showed very few reads for this species (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Table S2). In contrast, among the 4 male adult tick samples, Coxiella-like bacterium (AB001519) was found in only one sample with 0.7% relative abundance (Fig. 3B). Relative abundance of Corynebacterium spp., including C. falsenii, C. xerosis, and C. resistens was more than 40% in 4 nymphs (N8, N9, N10, and N11) but it was not detected in other samples (Fig. 3B).\nTo identify significant differences in bacterial abundance between the nymph, female adult, and female adult ticks, we performed LEfSe analysis. The LDA scores for Coxiella-like bacterium (AB001519) was 4.88 and its average relative abundance was 66.4% in female adult ticks, 15.7% in nymphs, and 0.2% in male adult ticks (Table 1; Fig. 4A). The LDA score for P. fulva was 4.79 and its relative abundance was the highest in male adult ticks (86.9%, Fig. 4B). The LDA score for P. fluorescens was 3.51 and its relative abundance was the highest in male adult ticks (4.0%, Fig. 4C).\nKnown pathogenic species were also identified. Rickettsia rickettsii was detected in 3 nymphs and 3 male adult ticks and Coxiella burnetii was detected in 4 nymphs (Supplementary Table S2). In addition, Anaplasma bovis, which infects ruminants, was found in one nymph (Supplementary Table S2). Ehrlichia spp., Francisella spp., and Borrelia spp. were not detected in this study.\nH. longicornis is the most common tick species in the grass in Korea. According to previous studies, out of 7,973 ticks collected from farms in Korea, 7,758 (97.3%) were identified as H. longicornis [25,26]. H. longicornis is also known as a transmitter of several pathogens such as Rickettsia spp., Anaplasmataceae, Borrelia spp., Babesia spp., Francisella spp., Bratonella spp., Coxiella spp., and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus [27].\nIn this study, we investigated the differences in the microbiomes of H. longicornis nymphs, female adults, and male adults. The Shannon index was significantly higher for nymphs than the adult ticks (Fig. 1C). This suggests that nymphs harbor a more diverse bacterial community compared to adult ticks. In 6 species of ticks, including Haemaphysalis leporispalustris, microbiome richness and diversity were highest in the larval stage and eventually decreased in subsequent life stages; this result is in concordance with our findings [28]. Life-stage related differences in the microbiome of H. longicornis indicate that the tick loses most of the bacteria present in the early developmental stages and then reestablishes the bacterial community after molting [29,30].\nCoxiella spp. is known as an endosymbiont essential for the survival and reproduction of hard ticks [26,31]. Coxiella-like bacteria are a large group of yet-to-be-isolated and characterized bacteria phylogenetically close to the"

        "passage": " Heyer, 1962.<|endoftext|>The following is an 1874 Japanese map of Joseon Korea called, \u201cDetailed Map of the Country of Joseon\u201d (\u671d\u9bae\u570b\u7d30\u898b\u5168\u56f3).\nThe map shows Usando (\u4e8e\u5c71\u5cf6) as a small island to the south of Ulleungdo (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6). At the time, Korean maps were showing Usando as Ulleungdo\u2019s neighboring island of Jukdo, which is 2.2 kilometers off Ulleungdo\u2019s east shore, so that means that this map did not reflect the Korean preception of Ulleungdo at the time. In other words, the Japanese had an outdated map of Ulleungdo in 1874.\nThe following is text that was written at the bottom of the map and explained certain aspects of it.\nOne aspect the text explained was the island of Ulleungdo (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6). Here is a cutout of the section describing Ulleungdo.\nUlleungdo (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6), also known as Isotakeshima (\u5f13\u5d69\u5cf6 \u2013 \u30a4\u30bd\u30c0\u30b1\u5cf6), is part of Gangwon Province. It is located in the sea 1,000 ri from Samcheok (\u4e09\u965f). It has a circumference of 940 to 950 ri.\nUlleungdo (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6), also known as Isotakeshima (\u5f13\u5d69\u5cf6 \u2013 \u30a4\u30bd\u30c0\u30b1\u5cf6), is part of Gangwon Province. It is located in the sea 1,000 ri from Samcheok (\u4e09\u965f), and has a circumference of approximately 140 to 150 ri.\nThe above translation makes much more sense since the circumference of Ulleungdo was approximately 140 to 150 ri. At any rate, the above map is evidence that, in 1874, Japan knew that Usando was a neighboring island of Ulleungdo, but still did not know the exact location.\nAt any rate, the above map is evidence that, in 1874, Japan knew that Usando was a neighboring island of Ulleungdo, but still did not know the exact location.\nUTSURYO-TO Island(\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6), otherwise known as ISOMOYA-TO Island(\u5f13\u5d69\u5cf6), is an island attached to KOGENDO(\u6c5f\u539f\u9053). It is located 1000 ri(\u5343\u91cc) away across the sea from SANSYO(\u4e09\u6e09) and its perimeter is 945 ri(945\u91cc).\nI am not sure if \u201cISOMOYA-TO\u201d is correct because the third character of Kana letters written between lines is blurred.\nCaptitalized words show that they are read in Japanese.\nI think \u4e5d\u767e\u56db\u4e94\u5341\u91cc should be 940~950 ri, not 945 ri.\nThanks Madboots, Ponta, & Pacifist.\nI am curious about the name \u5f13\u5d69\u5cf6, which also appears on this 1806 Japanese map of Korea. Is it possible that \u5f13\u5d69\u5cf6 could have been another way to write Usando (\u4e8e\u5c71\u5cf6), which literally means \u201chigh mountain island\u201d?\nHe wrote \u201c\u5f13\u5d69 \u30a4\u30bd\u30c0\u30b1\u201don a mountain in Ullungdo.\nYes, I used to assume that the \u201cTakeshima\u201d in Isotakeshima was referring to \u201cBamboo Island,\u201d but the Chinese character, \u5d69, suggest that it was referring to the \u201ctall mountain\u201d (\u5d69 = tall mountain) on Ulleungdo. That is why I am wondering if the name \u201cIsotakeshima\u201d might have evolved from \u201cUsando\u201d (\u4e8e\u5c71\u5cf6), which also means \u201cTall Mountain Island\u201d?\ngroup in America, whose aim is empowerment of Japanese Americans.\nJPCL is the first Japanese group in America that publicly supports such a resolution.\nand on the Japanese government to correct its historic texts.\nresolution early next month.\nReally? What is JPCL?\nI can\u2019t believe this. Can someone confirm about this news?\nGerry again what you have is a Japanese copy of a Korean map. It\u2019s a huge error of yours to automatically assume the territorial perceptions of \u201cthe Japanese\u201d on maps made by other countries.\nJapanese cartographers copied maps from all countries. At this time in the 19th Century Japanese mappers were citing maps from all around the world. So to take one map from historical archives and say \u201cthe Japanese thought\u2026\u201d is not a very logical approach to history.\nThe Japanese mappers had confused perception of this region as whole. However for the most part their belief was that two islands existed in the East Sea. The Japanese were placing Dokdo (Matsushima) and Ulleungdo (Takeshima) all over the East Sea during this time. The position of the islands was usually wrong and the form was almost never correct.\nWhat happened to the Japanese in 1840 gives us insight as to how foreign maps affected Japanese maps. The first Europeans mapped Ulleungdo too far West and named it Argonaut later it was mapped correctly and named Dagelet. This created two \u201cUlleungdo\u2019s\u201d in the East Sea, the Westerly island was non-existent (Argonaut) and the Eastern (Dagelet) was correctly located.\nSee this European map.\nFrom there Japanese mapmakers copied the European maps and blindly drew \u201ctwo islands\u201d Ulleungdo and Dokdo more Westerly. Note the position and shape of this Japanese map is exactly the same as the European map above.\nWhen Seibold assigned the name Takeshima to the non-existent \u201cArgonaut\u201d and Matsushima to Dagelet the Japanese began to perceive Ulleungdo and Dokdo much farther West.\nIt is possible that \u5f13\u5d69 means a mound like an arch.\nmadboots Good job!!\nI don\u2019t know about the organization, but there are Japanese who support the resolution.\nI think it would be wired if people of the democratic country unanimously agree on political issue, though there are such countries in East Asia.\nThis could also be said of Korean maps. When the Japanese viewed Korean maps of the East Sea, they again saw two islands in the East Sea. At a glance they could see that the scale of these maps was off. Ulleungdo was much to close to the Korean mainland for these maps to be of accurate scale, so they too considered Usando to be Matsushima. The Japanese government had very little information of the islands directly next to Ulleungdo, only until 1880 did the Japanese government accurately record the existence of Ulleungdo\u2019s \u201cneighbour islands.\nThus during the investigation into Takeshima around 1878 the Japanese compared Korean maps and documents and some made the natural conclusion that Usando was Matsushima (Dokdo) This makes sense when you compare the Korean maps to Japanese maps.\nNot only that when Anyongbok protested Japanese fishing on Ulleungdo he clearly stated \u201cJasando (Usando) was Matsushima (Dokdo)\u201d This incident would leave an indelible impression on the territorial perceptions of both Koreans and Japanese for centuries thereafter.\nOn page 5 of the Anyongbok report found in the archives of the Murakawa family of Shimane Prefecture it was stated \u201cJasando is Matsushima\u201d It was said to be in the middle of the North Sea and part of Kangwan Province.\nTo the Japanese this would have only meant one island-Dokdo. This is because in 1667 the Japanese document Onshu-shicho-goki also recorded and two islands in the North Sea called Takeshima and Matushima.\nThe Japanese viewed many maps and documents to arrive at a general consensus about the East Sea, the most basic principle they relied on was two islands existed in the east sea and they followed this rule often with blind conviction.\nToadface, you have yet to show me even one Korean or Japanese map that shows \u201cUsando\u201d as Liancourt Rocks. I, on the other hand, have shown you several Korean and Japanese maps that show \u201cUsando\u201d as a neighboring island of Ulleungdo.\n\u5d69(Kasa) means height and size of piled thing, or Volume, capacity, and weight.\nGenerally, it doesn\u2019t use it to describe a huge thing.\nWhen the big mountain and the ranging of it are described, \u5cb3 or \u5dbd is handled.\nThough I do not percice an English nuance easily,bulkness(ly) or thik(ly) or luxuriant(ly) may have same nuance.\n\u5f13(yumi) means bow.\nSo, The outline of the island may be seen like thick, tall a little, arc of the bended bow from a distance.\nThis is only a my imagination.\nMaybe the Korean concept of \u5d69 is different from the Japanese?\nNot only that when Anyongbok protested Japanese fishing on Ulleungdo he clearly stated \u201cJasando (Usando) was Matsushima (Dokdo)\u201d.\nThe word in the second parentheses is only your imagination and not right.\nNot only that when Anyongbok protested Japanese fishing on Ulleungdo he clearly stated \u201c"
