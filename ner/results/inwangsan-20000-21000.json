Since Ray-Ban sunglasses are cut from a single piece of acetate and hand-polished, you shouldn't be able to feel any seams. Next, make sure the lenses are made of real glass. Then, look for low-quality metal hinges and poor engravings, which are red flags that the glasses are fake. Check the box for the serial numbers and inspect the booklet for errors.

What firmware version on your Telo do you have? Look at http://setup.ooma.com/ > Status at the top of the page.\nI will see what version of software the telo has - need to plug into it later tonight.\none thing that I wanted to report was that I plugged the phone into the base to charge from last night until i got home from work (at least 18 hours). The blue light was one and I saw the battery indicating charging. When I got home, I took it off the base to try and pair it and when I took it off, the battery indicator went to the single bar/sliver. Not sure if that means I have a defective battery that doesn't hold charge or what and whether that has anything to do with it no pairing, but thought I'd throw it out there and see if anyone has ideas.\nAnd the instructions say to charge the handset for how long?\ninstructions say to charge for at least 30 minutes before attempting to pair and also say that a full charge should take 10 hours.\nProcedure for a factory reset on the Telo, this will return all settings to default and wipe the previous handset registration.\ntried resetting the telo base with no luck. handset will still not register with base. will give ooma a call today and hope they can do something abou it.\nso after a month long adventure trying to get in touch with tier 3 support, they approved an rma and sent me a new handset. problem is, this handset doesn't register either. i'm wondering if there is a problem with my telo base now. is that a possibility?\ni'm at my wits end trying to get this handset to register with the base. why is it so hard??!!\nturtlebud wrote: so after a month long adventure trying to get in touch with tier 3 support, they approved an rma and sent me a new handset. problem is, this handset doesn't register either. i'm wondering if there is a problem with my telo base now. is that a possibility?\nThe only thing that comes to mind is your step 3 above. The \"A\" (actually an antenna icon) has two functions, one as a handset pager (for finding lost handsets by causing them to ring), and the second, desired function in your case to initiate registration. If you just tap the antenna logo it will start to slowly flash - indicating the page function has been activated. In order to start the activation function you must hold down the icon until it starts to rapidly flash while you are holding it down, which takes about three seconds.<|endoftext|>Popcorn ceilings in Rimforest homes and businesses were once very popular.

In consideration of its location, the museum was planned as an urban museum that exhibits contemporary artworks of various genres.\nMMCA Seoul preserves the architectural traces and memories of significant historical times ranging from the Joseon era (1392\u20131910) to the Japanese colonial era (1910\u20131945) and the Korean War (1950\u20131953) period. Architect Hyoun-jun Min tried to embrace these traces and memories to create a building that melds with the surrounding environment.\nAs such, the museum consists of three buildings of different periods\u2014a government office building from the Joseon Dynasty, a modern building built in the early 20th century, and a newly built contemporary style building. In particular, visitors can witness the remnants of different periods while sitting at the center of the museum\u2019s vast garden. They can also enjoy the beautiful landscape created by Gyeongbokgung Palace and Inwangsan Mountain on the west.\nThis museum sits on the foothills of Cheonggyesan Mountain encircled by nature. It offers visitors both art and relaxation amid nature through various programs and facilities (i.e. eight exhibition halls including the circular gallery, outdoor sculpture park, and Children\u2019s Museum).\nIt is situated in the west wing of Deoksugung Palace\u2019s Seokjojeon Hall, the first Western-style stone building in Korea. The beautiful garden next to the museum creates perfect harmony with the nearby buildings, and it adds to the elegant atmosphere of the museum. Another merit of the museum is that it exhibits renowned modern artwork from across the world.\nHoused in a former tobacco factory, MMCA Cheongju was designed to maintain the previous factory structure as much as possible to preserve its historical value. The museum exhibits approximately 11,000 pieces of artwork. In particular, unlike conventional storage, the \u201cVisible Storage\u201d allows visitors to enter and enjoy works of art that the museum stores behind glass windows.\nNot far from MMCA Seoul, Insa-dong is a popular tourist site among foreigners who want to experience traditional Korean culture. The streets are filled with antique shops, traditional handicraft stores, traditional tea houses, restaurants and galleries.\nShuttle bus operated between Gwancheon, Seoul and Deoksugung branches. Check website for schedule.\nMimesis Art Museum was designed by Alvaro Siza, who is called the \u201clast living master of modernist architecture.\u201d The owner of the museum had visited buildings designed by Siza in Portugal and the UK before asking him to design this museum. The design of Mimesis began from a sketch of a cat curled up and falling asleep under the warm afternoon sun. Indeed, the actual shape of the museum resembles a white cat lying on the quiet fields in Paju.\nExcept for the floors, both the museum\u2019s interior and exterior are white. Siza, known for his thoughtful consideration of the users/residents rather than pursuing external splendor, hid functional hardware such as switches and power outlets, and whitewashed the walls and ceilings to create an exhibition space ideal for displaying and viewing artwork. Siza contained variedly sized exhibition spaces into a single mass. Each small space is smoothly connected along curved walls. Plus, the gentle natural light coming through the skylight shines on"

Non Freemasons do not get to see a lodge meeting because everyone in the room must prove themselves to be a Freemason during the opening ceremony, however this page will give an insight to the rough layout of a normal meeting in the South Australian and Northern Territory Constitution (every constitution will do things a little differently).\nA lodge room is laid out East to West and North to South, with seating along the walls of all sides. In the middle of the room is a rectangular black and white tessellated pavement along with a few other objects central to the moral teachings of Freemasonry.\nThe Master of the Lodge sits on the East side where he presides over the entire meeting; next to him is the Immediate Past Master who, having been the previous Master, provides advice and support. Opposite the Master on the West side sits the Senior Warden, second in charge of the Lodge, while the Junior Warden sits along the South of the Lodge room. Each officer has moral reasons for sitting where he does, for example the Master is placed in the East to represent the sun, which rises in the East.\nTo demonstrate what a lodge room looks like during a meeting, see the interactive image below. It was taken at the April 2011 Grand Communication and so depicts a meeting of the Grand Lodge of South Australia and Northern Territory when the Grand Lodge officers for the year are installed in their respective positions. The bulk of the Freemasons in the photo are therefore Grand Lodge officers or representitives of lodges.\nDrag your mouse to move the image around.\n(As this was a meeting of Grand Lodge, the officers in the positions are Grand Officers hence their titles would actually contain the word Grand, eg Grand Master, Senior Grand Warden etc.).\nIf you can not see the images above, please install Adobe Flash.<|endoftext|>The newspapers of the City Condal center in the party of Anoeta more than in the security of the Classic one.

The photographed spaces are presented with no identification as to the specific locations they were taken or any chronology. The combination of text and drawing infuse the photographs with emotional and psychological allusions.\nReferencing both the filmic frame and a story- board and blending narrative and documentary, the notes explore narrative moments and attempt to construct the landscape of a personal geography. The hand-tinted process brings to mind the childlike activity of colouring books, as an attempt to make sense of space, colour, architecture and perspective, but can ultimately be read as the artist\u2019s attempt to question representation and to situate the photographed spaces in one\u2019s personal imagery.<|endoftext|>No gymnast gets to the Olympics without making major sacrifices along the way. For teens, that can mean skipping out on the traditional academic experience in favor of long days plowing through floor routines and mastering maneuvers on beam. Where does Laurie Hernandez go to school? The gold medalist is homeschooled, according to The Ringer.\nHernandez hasn't attended a brick-and-mortar school since she was about 10 years old, The Ringer reported. Instead, she spends most days at one of two gyms to chip away at her 35 hours of weekly training time. It's a grueling schedule, but Hernandez's hard work earned the 16-year-old an early acceptance to college: she made a verbal commitment to the University of Florida. After making Team USA, though, she decided to give up the gymnastics scholarship. Hernandez announced she's going pro on Instagram on Thursday: \"I am so proud and excited to announce that I've turned professional and given up my NCAA eligibility; although I will always be a Florida Gator at heart\ud83d\udc99 I'm looking forward to continuing to represent USA at the highest level of gymnastics for several years to come!\"\nThough Hernandez likely won't be going to college anytime soon, she may opt to finish high school. A Beka Academy provides Hernandez's homeschooling curriculum, according to Team USA. The school focuses on providing Christian education, with offerings of independent study options for high school students outlined on the academy's website. A Beka Academy coursework looks a lot like what most high schools offer, but the curriculum requires four credits in Bible studies. Though Hernandez often talks about faith being a big part of her life, Hernandez's USA Gymnastics profile indicates that her favorite school subjects are science and art.\nThough most students plan their lives around school, Hernandez plans school around her training schedule. Hernandez's typical training day starts at 8:30 a.m., NBC reported. She spends six days of each week at the gym, though she generally gets two half days. When she's finished flipping and flying, she heads home to get through her classwork. If she's training at Monmouth Gymnastics Academy, it only takes her about 15 minutes to get home to Old Bridge, New Jersey, according to The Ringer. Her other practice space, Gymland, is about an hour away. And after earning her place in the USA Gymnastics elite program, she's had to pencil in about 12 journeys per year to the famed Karolyi Ranch in Texas.\nThough her schedule doesn't allow her much free time, Hernandez still has hobbies outside of gymnastics; her USA Gymnastics profile reveals that she likes to go swimming, ride her bike, and even paint nails. Though she's known for her artistry in competition, she's also an artist off the floor: Hernandez is a writer who loves to draw.\nShe may not get the full high school experience, but she finally got to go to the Olympics as a member of The Final Five. Earning a silver medal on balance beam and getting the gold with her team, Hernandez got to see her dreams come true.<|endoftext|>Oh thank God.

Chef Park continues to travel to Italy every year to learn regional cuisines and develop new dishes for Gallina Daisy. The restaurant is a converted 1950\u2019s residence in the Hanok-filled neighborhood of Seochon. The main dining hall is located on the first floor, the second floor provides dining rooms open for cooking classes, and the third floor is a private dining space that offers an amazing view of Inwangsan mountain. The softly-lighted dining hall and dark-wood furniture create a warm, inviting atmosphere accompanied by elegant dishes.\nGallina Daisy strives to serve seasonal Italian pastas using simple but flavorful local ingredients. Chef Park believes Italian food doesn\u2019t require imported ingredients from Europe, and instead, incorporates Jeju black pork, local fish, pork from Jirisan and other ingredients from around the country. One great example is the fish carpaccio dish that\u2019s both local and seasonal. Another signature dish is the spaghetti with bottarga, zucchini and Moresca olive oil. The bottarga, or mullet roe, is air-dried in Jirisan with moonbaeju. The flavors come solely from the fresh ingredients as the kitchen doesn\u2019t use artificial seasoning. Everything is made on site, from the breads to the desserts.\nCaf\u00e9 Dimi is a neighborhood stalwart. Numerous bistros and caf\u00e9s have come and gone in the Seochon area, but Dimi has stayed its course, serving fresh pastas, pizzas and wine at surprisingly affordable prices for nearly a decade. It\u2019s easy to pass by the corner-shop restaurant as there\u2019s no blaring sign. Neighborhood regulars know that the food is great, but the caf\u00e9 views of Gyeongbok-palace road are hard to top. Grab a seat by the window at dusk and drink in the Seochon views as you dig into their pastas and pizzas.\nEach morning, the Dimi kitchen is busy at work making the doughs for their pastas, pizzas and breads. The restaurant focuses on quality ingredients that are local, seasonal and organic. They realize that while Seochon is a popular day-tripper neighborhood, the key to survival is to attract dangol or regular customers. Dimi does this with good quality sandwiches, pastas and pizzas around the KRW 10,000 price range. The lovely views come free of charge.<|endoftext|>This slip-on boot keeps it simple \u2014 clean lines, a perfect fit, and splash-ready protection.

The new Midlock grip features the deepest pistol dimension allowed by the USGA and is positioned sideways which pushes the shaft angle away from the forearm to reduce the typical 9 degrees of loft in as seen in an Armlock putter to just 4 degrees. This comfortable and effective setup produces a much more consistent one-piece putting stroke for reliability at short and long ranges.\nThe face used in ER11v MidLock features variable groove separations across the width of the face. By having deeper, and wider spaced grooves in the centre with shallower, more frequent groove spacing towards the heel and toe, golfers can rely on much greater consistency and ball speeds even on off-centre strikes.\nER11 v1 has a dual black and classic silver satin finish which perfectly contrast together for exceptional ease of alignment, particularly over short putts.\nWith a toe hang of 7\u00b0 this putter suits players with a slight rotation in their stroke.<|endoftext|>Stanbic Bank Botswana, a member of Standard Bank Group; the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), the U.S. Government\u2019s development finance institution; and Botswana Finance LLC, a subsidiary of Lazare Kaplan International (LKI), have signed a $ 125 million loan guarantee, which will encourage and support lending to diamond manufacturers and polishing companies while allowing the organisations to share credit risk.\nThe aim is to encourage diamond beneficiation, promote job creation locally and help in diversification of the economy, drive the development of the local financial sector and give local companies access to financing, the three partners noted.\nIn keeping with Standard Bank\u2019s objective of driving growth in Africa, Stanbic Bank has been lending to diamond beneficiation companies in Botswana for over ten years and this facility will support and allow the expansion of availability of financing for the sector.\nThis is the second tranche of a $ 250 million OPIC loan guaranty \u2013 the first of which was fulfilled by Barclays Bank of Botswana in 2016.<|endoftext|>A Staffworks expanded executive team reflects an aggressive growth initiative.\nTodd has 27 years of experience in staffing services and has held various Staffworks management positions for 19 years.

They capture a number of \"barbarians,\" bring them back to town, torture them, kill some of them, and leave for the capital in order to prepare a larger campaign against the barbarians. In the meantime, the Magistrate becomes involved with a \"barbarian girl\" who was left behind crippled and blinded by the torturers. Eventually, he decides to take her back to her people.

        "passage": " divided. When that happens, leaders face a dilemma: they can advocate for the point of view they think is right, or they can work to hold the community together. Most of the time community is more important\u2014but not always.\nSome fences are just too hard to straddle. It\u2019s fine to say, \u201cWe\u2019re one big family. We agree to disagree.\u201d But when the disagreement is about a matter of fundamental principle, such as who can be recognized as a full member of the family, it\u2019s not so simple.\nToday a number of denominations\u2014including the United Methodist Church\u2014are struggling over how and whether to ordain gay and lesbian people. The easiest difference for outsiders to see is simply between \u201cprogressives\u201d who want to recognize a wider range of people and \u201cconservatives\u201d who hold to older standards of acceptable behavior.\nBut another difference is more visible to the participants themselves\u2014between those whose first priority is to achieve what they think is the right outcome and those who want to hold the community together.\nI first encountered this dilemma when I was in college, writing for the student paper. The local Episcopal church was divided over women\u2019s ordination. Almost all the members of that congregation agreed that the church should ordain women\u2014but some wanted it to happen through an orderly decision process while others insisted it should happen right away.\nThis situation was hard to explain to my student editors, who kept trying to simplify the story into a battle between \u201cliberals\u201d and \u201cconservatives.\u201d It was hard for them to understand how anyone was willing to live with the suppression of women\u2019s gifts and calling\u2014even temporarily\u2014if that\u2019s what it took to bring everyone along.\nChurch or sect?\nSome faith traditions specialize in righteous action to right wrongs, while others favor unity, even at the cost of ambiguity about important points. Each denomination transmits family traditions about how to handle this dilemma, often by telling stories about faith heroes.\nIf we talk about prophetic souls who clung to the right even unto martyrdom, we frame ourselves as a \u201csect\u201d\u2014an outpost of purity against prevailing views. But if we speak with pride of famous presidents and business leaders who once belonged to our faith group, or recall the days when the town high school held its graduation in our sanctuary, we\u2019re seeing ourselves in \u201cchurchly\u201d terms\u2014as a religious home for everyone in the community.\nOf course none of us inherits one tradition pure. Most of us resonate with both the \u201csect\u201d idea of holding to the right regardless of the cost and the \u201cchurchly\u201d hope of holding a diversity of viewpoints under one big tent. We all know people who belong to congregations for all kinds of reasons\u2014habit, family, music\u2014that have little to do with their opinions on theology or social issues.\nWho counts as a member?\nThe broad-church style has great appeal: \u201cIf we agree in love, no disagreement can do us any harm. If we do not agree in love, no other agreement can do us any good.\u201d This broad-church sentiment and others like it have been attributed to the founders of a number of denominations.\nBut the \u201cchurchly\u201d way of understanding faith community is often founded on unstated assumptions about who counts as a full member. Once upon a time it seemed normal to ask a woman to join a church that put a ceiling on her leadership. More recently, congregations plausibly could say they loved gay people\u2014so long as they stayed closeted and celibate. Still today, many congregations that claim to be inclusive hold transgender people at arm\u2019s length.\nThe \u201cbroad church\u201d idea depends on a certain level of consensus about who counts. That\u2019s why many of our most established churches split over slavery and the Civil War, and it\u2019s why so many churches have split\u2014or will split soon\u2014over boundaries to inclusion based on sexuality and gender. When people become fully visible, it is no longer plausible to claim to be inclusive while excluding them.\nIn our time, when religious affiliation has become an option rather than an obligation, congregations need to declare their principles out loud in order to project a clear identity. This situation favors splitting over holding too wide a range of viewpoints in one space. Two congregations, each committed to consistent principles, may fare better in a marketplace of people who increasingly demand reasons to affiliate at all.\nFor leaders, straddling the fence feels sensible and safe. A little ambiguity can go a long way when it comes to holding a community together. Until it doesn\u2019t. Some issues are too central to a congregation\u2019s purpose and identity to fudge. Excluding people in the name of keeping \u201ceverybody\u201d under one big tent makes no sense at all.\nOne of my church clients posed a profound question to itself: \u201cWhat are the core values for which we would sacrifice our unity?\u201d It\u2019s a worthwhile question for a congregation of integrity to ponder. Straddling the fence can be a good move tactically, but sometimes leaders have to make a choice.<|endoftext|>Hiking Seoul Fortress (\uc11c\uc6b8\uc131\uacfd) is one of the best ways to experience a conspicuous remnant of Seoul\u2019s ancient past.\nFirst constructed in 1396 \u2013 just five years after King Taejo founded the Joseon Dynasty \u2013 the earthen wall was built to join the ridge lines of the four small mountains that surrounded Seoul proper \u2013 Namsan (\ub0a8\uc0b0) in the south, Inwangsan (\uc778\uc655\uc0b0) to the west, Naksan (\ub099\uc0b0) to the east, and Bugaksan (\ubd81\uc545\uc0b0) in the North.\nAlthough much of the old Seoul Fortress wall has been torn down, significant portions remain and others are being rebuilt.\nAs you\u2019re hiking Seoul Fortress, you can tell from the size and shape of the stones which era in which it was built. The original walls, built in the late 14th century were constructed of medium-sized round stones held together by mud.\nThe next major expansion, which took place during King Sejong the Great\u2019s reign in the mid 15th century, are marked by rectangular stones closely fit together.\nAnother major restoration in 1704 was when King Sukjong rebuilt sections of the wall using large, uniform stone slabs joined so tightly that even a sheet of paper can\u2019t fit in-between.\nAmong what\u2019s left of the Seoul Fortress wall, the stretch from Bugaksan to Inwangsan mountains provide some of the best preserved stretches that, along with spectacular views, make for a great day hike.\nRecently reopened to the public, the trail begins at Waryong Park (\uc640\ub8e1\uacf5\uc6d0). Turning left after a short break in the wall, the trail leads past a virtual tunnel of blooming vines.\nA boardwalk extends throughout the forest, whose canopy provides welcome relief from the summer sun. After several hundred meters, the forest gives way to open sky, and the upscale neighborhood of Seongbuk-dong (\uc131\ubd81\ub3d9) comes into view.\nOnce you reach the Sukjeongmun gate Rest Area, it\u2019s mandatory that visitors register with the office. It takes just a couple of minutes to furnish your passport, provide your contact information, receive a badge, and then your on your way to see the Great Northern Gate, Sukjeongmun (\uc219\uc815\ubb38).\nAmong the four main gates that mark each of the cardinal points, Sukjeongmun is the smallest. Primarily constructed to comply with geomantic principles, it\u2019s mountain-top location meant it didn\u2019t see much traffic.\nNevertheless, from its perch on the slopes of Bugaksan, a great view of northern Seoul can be had.\nWhile hiking Seoul Fortress, every 200 meters or so you\u2019re bound to see a young man patrolling the area.\nFriendly but hardly chatty, their presence reminds you that this area just north of the presidential house and less than two hours from the border with North Korea, remains a highly sensitive area as it was centuries ago.\nWith that in mind, photos are, for the most part, restricted, but the views from on high are definitely worth the trek, even if you can\u2019t keep a memento.\nAfter reaching Bugaksan\u2019s 342 meter peak, it\u2019s time to wind your way back down. As the trail becomes increasingly steep, you\u2019ll thank me for taking you on the westward route.\nAfter the precipitous descent, the stately secondary gate of Changuimun (\ucc3d\uc758\ubb38) signals your arrival in the peaceful hamlet of Buam-dong (\ubd80\uc554\ub3d9), and just in time for lunch!\nOpen: Most sections are open 24 hours. However, the section between Waryong Park and Changuimun\u2019s hours vary. Closed Mondays.\nDirections: The Mt. Bugaksan section of the Seoul Fortress can be accessed via Anguk Station on Seoul Metro Line 3 (exit #2). Immediately outside the exit is a bus stop. Take bus #02 to the Sungkyunkwan University rear gate.<|endoftext|>Science sure is neat when it is either presented in a way that doesn\u2019t put you to sleep, or is so mind-blowingly interesting that you couldn\u2019t possibly fall asleep.
