        "passage": ", Red Lining, Scorched Earth, Mass Incarceration for crimes not committed or receiving massive sentences for petty crimes, Devil\u2019s Punchbowl Concentration Camp (freed hostages from the human trafficking of Africans) were put in concentration camps and killed by the thousands, Tulsa & Rosewood Massacres (when black people built wealth, their cities were burned to the ground and hundreds murdered). The system of racism was set up to prevent black advancement.\nWe never want to forget 9/11 or the Holocaust, yet hid Concentration Camps for black people and torturing/killing millions of them. We cannot hide from the skeletons in the closet.\nPresident Hoover stated he would never allow a Negro (not the word he used) to rise to power like Malcom X or Dr. Martin Luther King Jr unless the government formed that man. During the Black Panther Party era, government officials were sent into black neighborhoods to loot, start riots, and hurt people and blame it on the black community.\nI have had my own experiences with racism even the past few weeks.\nI believe racism stole parts of my childhood.  You are brilliant, yet must work twice as hard.\u201d I did not get as much play time. I did college level work in secondary school. I was moved into a school for the gifted and I hated that school. Parents did not want their kids to be with me or come to my house. I am not that old people! This is recent stuff.\nI recall going to an all white church and the lady telling me, \u201cThis used to be a white church.\u201d She grabbed her purse and moved. She turned to me and said, \u201cI am not moving because you are black.\u201d Racism seems to find comfort next to religion, this should not be. I think it\u2019s because sometimes in circles of faith excuses are made for sin and Sunday mornings are typically the most segregated day of the week. People are not forced to relate to anyone who does not look or think just like them.\nKudos to pastors trying to diversify their church! Heaven is a multiethnic place. If you don\u2019t like brown people, just wait til you see Jesus and most saved people in the Bible. They were brown, dark brown.\nI recall my years working in a laboratory where white people, especially white men would take credit for my work. Sometimes their names were put on reports I wrote. Sometimes those with far less qualifications would complain when I was promoted and work against efforts. One lady told me, \u201cWell, at least your job is secure because you are a minority.\u201d Obviously it was affirmative action. There was sometimes resentment, pushback, lying, and some nasty parts too.  It\u2019s a misunderstanding or you get shunned.\n I have worked twice, if not three times harder than some of my peers and have faced dishonor for the way God created me to be. I thank God for who I am. I am not seeking any sympathy. \nThere are more black men in college than in jail, which is a miracle considering racism and profiling. There are more black women getting advanced degrees than any ethnic group. There are 107 historically black universities in America. There is a group on Instagram called the Dad Gang, they showcase black fathers caring for their kids. I was raised by an upstanding black man. We are not ignorant, poor, thieves, violent, nor fit any of the stereotypes. We are also not the anomaly.\nMedia paints the pictures it wants society to believe. I had a friend who\u2019s mom became racist after watching the news daily.  I do not trust all things shared in media.\nRacism is woven into all 7 mountains of influence, including the church. \nI saw how professing Christians have bullied others online, threatened ministers who supported black lives matter, and black out Tuesday. I have watched threatening of businesses too. One platform minister told me she lost thousands of followers. Just for saying black lives matter. Threats, tantrums, name calling\u2026all in the name of Jesus. I have been called some colorful names and threatened too!!  I rebuked one last week. She deleted me. God bless you, yet not apologizing for calling sin what it is. Narcissism must be addressed in church and thinking the world revolves around us. The Gospel revolves around Jesus.\nWhether we recognize it or not, the world sees our hypocrisy. The world sees the disparity regarding the causes of injustice we support. The world sees when we don\u2019t seem to care. The world sees racism in the church even if Christians bury their heads in the sand.\nIn this racial unrest, some professing Christians have not demonstrated the heart of a Good Samaritan. I met with protestors, let some cry on me, listened to stories. While some of the Christians I knew watched from their comfy homes passing judgement and denouncing Black Lives Matter, focused on looters/rioters, they missed the whole point.\nIt took protests and unrest to get the two men who murdered Ahmaud Aubrey and filmed it arrested. He was not a criminal. He was jogging down the street.  It took protests and unrest to get the cop arrested who knelt on George Floyd for 8 minutes and 46 seconds arrested. Many others have never been prosecuted.  The autistic boy who played violin was just walking home. Dead. Why are people so upset? Why are they rioting? Why are people crying? We don\u2019t have a racism problem in America! The system is just.\n The police even took him to get food. Yet George Floyd supposedly had a fake 20 dollar bill and was lynched on film. If you think this is a just system, tell me the last time you saw a white person lynched and it broadcasted? Our white serial killers and rapists are treated with greater dignity.\nI grow weary from deleting abrasive, prejudice, and racist comments on my social media. People have been combative, angry, refusing love if they do not agree politically. It\u2019s made me sad to be labeled a Christian. Yet who am I to judge. My job is to roll up my sleeves and keep jumping in the ring. I keep trying to educate people online even when they call me mames or call me racist (they do not know what that word means). I do know because I have lived it! Oh my I have lived it. My parents lived it. My grandparents lived it. My Native and Jewish ancestors lived it.\nWe keep getting back up even if the world or church seemingly chants, \u201cWe don\u2019t truly care about you! You don\u2019t matter. If you say you matter, then you are excluding others and racist.\u201d I keep getting back up when exposed to some of the worst of humanity. That will be our legacy! Overcomers. We have come a long way, yet we still have a long way to go.\nI hope something said here helps someone. If you have been an ally and genuinely care, thank you! God bless you. I am thankful for anyone willing to stand up against injustice.\nBefore I go, I do care about the injustice to police who are doing their jobs or businesses owners looted. I also recognize the catalyst for all the unrest. I do not know how I would respond to all this if I did not know Jesus.\nWe can deny it, deflect from it, look away, or ask what we can do about the problem. It is a problem. Cities should not have to be burned to get a murder on film taken care of\u2026and for those who say, \u201cWhy can\u2019t they just pray or peaceful protest.\u201d The football players tried that; they were called unpatriotic and by our leadership sons of $&!\u201d?\u2019s. Dr. King peacefully protested and he was violently beaten, water hosed, his friends beaten/murdered, dogs let loose on him, threatened, and he was murdered. Can we stop pretending that the protest is the issue and look at racism/rage against people of color. If we do not pay attention, I believe history will keep trying to repeat itself.<|endoftext|>Geographically, Dokdo is located 87.4 km from Ulleungdo of Korea and 157.5km from the Oki Islands of Japan. Dokdo is visible to the naked eye from Ulleungdo, but not from the Oki Islands.\nHistorically, Korea has been aware of Dokdo's existence since the sixth century, whereas Japan only began to know about Dokdo from the seventeenth century. This can be confirmed through a number of Japanese historical records and old maps which acknowledge that Dokdo is not part of Japan's territory.\nFrom the standpoint of international law, the Korean Empire legally proclaimed Dokdo as its territory in Imperial Decree No. 41 (1900), stipulating that Dokdo is under the jurisdiction of Ulleungdo. Later, Japan's Shiname Prefecture illegally incorporated Dokdo into its territory by issuing Notice No. 40 (1905).\nThe \u201cEast Sea\u201d is a geographic designation Koreans have been using for over 2,000 years. Unfortunately, the widespread use of the name \"Sea of Japan\" started settling in the international community around the time of Japan's colonial rule over Korea and persists to date. This is why efforts are currently being made to internationally reinstate the geographic name \"East Sea\" for the waters where Dokdo stands.\nUnequivocally, Dokdo in the East Sea is the rightful territory of the Republic of Korea from the standpoint of geography, history, and international law.<|endoftext|>A Bible story is read and then discussed by the children, lead by the local Pastor.\nThen a CRAFT project that the children they put together.

The discovery was made at 9:48am on Sunday 15th July at a depth of approximately 1,400 feet beneath sea level.\nThe island of Ulleungdo, situated in the Sea of Japan. Image courtesy of Google Maps.\nThe video below shows footage of the discovery by the salvage team from their two submersibles. The film shows that the hull, masts, and the stern of the Donskoi are damaged, but the upper deck remains intact and the hull is also well preserved. The video also shows the ship\u2019s anchors and machine guns still in place.\nThe Shinil Group has said it will take several months to orchestrate salvage work and raise the wreck, estimating that the ship would be raised in October or November this year.\nThe group plans to give half of the recovered gold back to the Russian government, and then give 10% of the remaining half (\u00a34.985 million) to the island of Ulleungdo for tourism purposes, including a museum dedicated to the ship.\nThe Shinil Group who discovered the wreckage initially stated that they were the first team to find the Dmitrii Donskoi, but this has since been proven incorrect by the Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology (KIOST).\nThe government-funded team found the wreckage in 2003 but failed to raise it. Their discovery was reported by Korean and regional media organisations and the public can still see the photographs the team took from their dives 15 years ago.\nThis previous discovery could jeopardise the latest team\u2019s claim to the salvage, as they wouldn\u2019t be the only right holders to the wreckage, but KIOST also claim that the Shinil Group found the Donskoi through unauthorised use of information that was the intellectual property of the institute.\nThere are further obstacles for the Korean treasure hunters to overcome too. The Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries has told BBC Korea that the Shinil Group has not yet applied for salvage rights and were it to do so it would owe 10% of the salvage value to the Korean government.\nEven if the Shinil Group and their associates from Britain and Canada ARE successful in getting permission and being the sole rights holders for the salvage, some experts are saying that the ship couldn\u2019t physically hold 200 tonnes of gold as well as the crew, rations, and munitions, while others question why the Donskoi would even hold that much gold in the first place given the easier travel arrangement of gold bullion to go by train to the port of Vladivostok.\nDmitrii Donskoi in New York Harbour on Thursday April 27th, 1893 on a goodwill visit coinciding with the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America by Columbus. Photo courtesy of Wikipedia and the Creative Commons license.\nThe Dmitrii Donskoi (\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0414\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439) was a first-class ironclad Russian cruiser named after the Grand Duke of Moscow. It was built in 1885 and weighed 5,800 tonnes. It served for 20 years in the Russian Baltic Fleet and was used in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905 to protect slower transport ships.\nThe ship was taking part in the Battle of Tsushima when it was separated from the rest of the Russian Fleet in low light. The ship\u2019s captain elected to make a break for it, choosing to race north towards Vladivostok, through the Japanese fleet. The first attack by the Japanese was unsuccessful in damaging the cruiser but later in the night it was spotted again and suffered critical damage, with 60 of the 591 crew members killed in the firefight and a further 120 injured.\nCaptain Lebedev elected to weigh anchor at Ulleungdo for the night and disembark, before scuttling the ship the next day on May 29th, 1905. It is believed this was done so that its cargo \u2013 the alleged gold hoard \u2013 would not fall into Japanese hands. The team from the Shinil Group claim that this vast wealth was the wages for the entire Russian navy.\nTo read the official press release given by the Shinil Group to PR Newswire, click here.<|endoftext|>Hiring a Crook Defense Lawyer A criminal defense lawyer is a legal professional who concentrates on safeguarding people as well...<|endoftext|>Great SE location-Village at Fossil Lake.Lovely & Bright 3 bedroom,2 bath,2 car garage & balcony faces East.

In essence, we give conditions for the stability of the fixed points of any real polynomial map with real fixed points. In order to do this, we have introduced the concept of Canonical Polynomial Maps which are topologically conjugate to any polynomial map of the same degree with real fixed points. The stability of the fixed points of canonical polynomial maps has been found to depend solely on a special function termed Product Position Function for a given fixed point. The values of this product position determine the stability of the fixed point in question, when it bifurcates, and even when chaos arises, as it passes through what we have termed stability bands. The exact boundary values of these stability bands are yet to be calculated for regions of type greater than one for polynomials of degree higher than three.\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe theory of discrete dynamical systems with iteration functions given by polynomials is an intensive research subject where a wide variety of discrete models have been proposed to describe and to analyze different mechanisms in various areas of science. For example, in Biology and more specifically in Population Dynamics there are many simple models that are used to study the asymptotic behavior of some species that live in isolated generations; see, for instance, [1][2][3][4][5][6][7].\nAlthough the dynamics of parametric polynomial discrete systems are very complex their bifurcation diagrams have proved to be a very useful visual tool. A new method for constructing a rich class of bifurcation diagrams for unimodal maps was presented in [8], where the behavior of quadratic maps was analyzed when the dependence of their coefficients was given by continuous functions of a parameter. Conditions on the coefficients of the quadratic maps were given in order to obtain regular reversal maps. Our first goal is to restate the results for more complex systems (cubic) than the quadratic systems analyzed in [8] and to state the results in the frame of a new formulation that would allow for generalization. Our second goal is to generalize the existing results on real quadratic maps for arbitrary real polynomial maps within a framework that allows us to understand the dynamics for a larger set of discrete systems. It is important to remark that our results are analytical and depend only on the parametric derivative of"

        "passage": " visit in Korea this season.\nAutumn foliage is beautiful viewed from the ground, but imagine getting a complete 360 degree view from above.\nDanyang is a popular destination in Korea for paragliding, as the mild weather and ideal geographic conditions provide the ultimate paragliding experience almost 300 days out of the year. The experience is particularly stunning during the autumn months, when the surrounding mountains take on shades of warm orange and gold.\nYou do not need any prior experience with paragliding. Professionals will guide you each step of the way, from registration to driving up the mountain to takeoff and landing. There is even a video recording option, in which you can receive a video at the end of the journey of the entire 11 minute flight. It\u2019s a fun keepsake to remember your time in Korea!\nWhile you are in Danyang, try some dishes with garlic, as garlic is a local specialty.  If you are not a fan of chicken, you can also find garlic tteokgalbi (beef) and garlic dumplings.\nLocated just an hour away from Seoul, Chuncheon is a city located in the beautiful natural retreat of Gangwon Province. Home to many lakes and mountains, the city is a popular destination for outdoor activities even for locals. While there are plenty of options to choose from, one activity we recommend is canoeing on Chuncheon Mulle-gil.\nChuncheon was the first place in Korea to introduce wooden canoes. The owner first encountered canoes while studying abroad in Canada, and to his disappointment, he found they were not widely known in Korea. He decided to change that and began making his own wooden canoes and in 2011, Chuncheon Mulle-gil was opened.\nChucheon Mulle-gil soon gained even more recognition after appearing in popular Korean TV Shows including \u201cTwo Days, One Night\u201d and \u201cRunning Man\u201d. There are a total of three courses available, as well as a range of programs for different skill levels and group sizes. It is a fun teambuilding activity for groups, allowing members to spend time together while taking in the beautiful natural scenery of Korea.\nAfter a long day of canoeing, satisfy your appetite by visiting Chuncheon Myeongdong Dakgalbi Street for a taste of the city\u2019s specialty food \u2013 Dakgalbi. Dakgalbi, or spicy stir-fried chicken, is a mouthwatering dish made by stir-frying a combination of sweet potatoes, cabbage, scallions, rice cakes and diced chicken marinated in a spicy gochujang sauce. You can even fry rice in the remaining sauce for a delicious end to your meal. Typically served in a large skillet in the middle of the table, it is a fantastic dish to share as a group.\nTIP: On weekends, special sunset canoe tours are available. Rowing through the lake during sunset is an experience not to be missed.\nMany people are probably familiar with the island of Jeju, but there is another island off the east coast of mainland Korea that is often overlooked but definitely worth a visit.\nUlleungdo offers a taste of island life that is more authentic and closer to nature than the more industrialized Jeju or the mainland. Perhaps that is one of the reasons why the island is often tagged with the labels \u2018mysterious\u2019 or \u2018spiritual\u2019. The unobstructed natural scenery is unlike what you will find in other parts of Korea. Boasting plenty of ocean views, sweeping mountains and beautiful sunsets, a visit to Ulleungdo will offer a healing, immersive experience in the great outdoors.\nThe best way to explore Ulleungdo is by foot or bike to take in the natural beauty up close, and the island offers both walking and biking trails that will put your right along the coastline, with views of the crashing waves below and the lush mountain ranges. A walk along the Haengnam Coastal Walking Path will bring you to the Dodong Lighthouse, where you can get a beautiful view of the surrounding oceans and even see out to Dokdo on a clear day.\nAfter exploring the island, be sure to taste some of the local specialties. Fresh seafood is in abundance, and the island is especially known for their grilled squid. For those that prefer meat over seafood, the island is also famous for its special bulgogi (roast beef) made from cows that graze on the island\u2019s herbs. The special diet of medicinal herbs results in a fragrant and flavorful meat that is unique to the island.\nWhat\u2019s great about visiting Gyeongju in autumn is the wide variety of sights. If you head over to the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site Bulguksa Temple, you will find the ancient temple surrounded by golden autumn leaves. If you head over to the area around Cheomseongdae Observatory, you will find endless fields of pink muhly, providing the perfect backdrop for photos. Or head over to the Bomun Lake Complex for a leisurely walk or bike ride around the lake.\nAs Gyeongju is a popular tourist destination, you can easily find small shops renting out bicycles, tandem bikes, and scooters. Hop on a bike, feel the crisp autumn breeze and enjoy the clear blue skies and colorful sights of Gyeongju\u2019s autumn.\nWith a recent boom in trendy cafes and restaurants in the Hwangridangilarea, there is no shortage of places to grab a bite, but be sure to try the Hwangnam-ppang, a local specialty. Many shops in Gyeongju sell the small sweet pastries filled with red bean paste. They are sold in gift boxes as well so be sure to pick up a few on your way home!\nDid you know, you can walk all the way around the island of Jeju? The Jeju Olle Trails are a set of 26 routes, consisting of 21 main routes and five sub-routes. The trails connect to make its way around the entire island, plus a few small surrounding islands. Trails range in difficulty from low to high, and durations range from one hour all the way up to eight hours. The routes offer an opportunity to observe the landscapes and seaside views of the island from up close, and each trail offers a unique experience. You can even get a passport where you can receive stamps for every trail you complete.\nFall is a great time to hike the trails, as the sun can be quite brutal when walking during the summer months. In the fall, the temperature is mild and perfect for a leisurely walk. In fact, Jeju Island hosts an Olle Walking Festival each year in the fall, and during festival time, you can spot long rows of people making their way along the trail together. It makes a great teambuilding activity. After your walk, be sure to fill up with some of Jeju\u2019s delicious fresh seafood!<|endoftext|>Healthcare systems around the world are in crisis. In both developed and developing countries systems are struggling to meet the needs of citizens.\nOne of the most critical challenges these systems face is a shortage of healthcare professionals. In developed countries, national healthcare systems periodically experience shortages of nurses or physicians. Usually these shortages are simply a function of demand growing faster than supply. This is most often corrected by introducing greater incentives into the labour market. By contrast, developing countries have long experienced chronic shortages of healthcare professionals.\nThese shortages are usually rooted in a lack of resources that prevents the training or retraining of sufficient numbers of nurses, physicians, or other healthcare professionals. However, in recent years, a number of demographic and societal changes have combined to create significant and long-term shortages in both developed and developing countries. There is an almost universal shortage of registered nurses (RNs), caused by increased demand in the face of a declining supply. Many countries also face significant shortages of medical doctors (MDs).\nThe recruitment of healthcare workers from less developed countries has emerged as one of the main responses of developed countries to the shortage of healthcare professionals. The latter are increasingly being recruited for temporary or permanent positions abroad. Though some of this movement occurs between developed countries, most is from developing to developed countries. The globalisation of the labour market for healthcare professionals has major implications for individual practitioners, for healthcare systems, and for governments. Some of these implications are positive, including the opportunities for nurses and physicians to improve their professional and personal lives and for developed countries to address the shortages of RNs and MDs they face. There are also significant negative consequences, primarily the drain this represents on the ability of less affluent countries to provide adequate healthcare for their citizens.\nThis policy brief begins by describing the extent of worldwide labour shortages in the healthcare sector as well as some general trends in the migration of healthcare workers. It then continues with a brief discussion of the factors which cause and influence this movement. The following section addresses the costs and benefits of the migration of healthcare workers, in both the sending and receiving countries. Finally, the brief presents some policy options which could be implemented by sending and receiving countries in order to mitigate the negative consequences of migration in this sector while balancing the rights and the needs of the main actors involved: healthcare professionals, developed countries and developing countries.\nSome of the material included in this brief first appeared in Clark, P.F., Stewart, J.B. and Clark, D.A. (2006): \"The Globalization of the Labour Market for Healthcare Professionals.\" International Labour Review 145 (1-2): 37-64.\nSee Clark, Stewart and Clark (2006).<|endoftext|>New construction on the golf course in Wildewood (Par 3 hole #6)!

TXNIP increases reactive oxygen species production and oxidative stress and thereby contributes to apoptosis. Recent studies indicate an evolving role of TXNIP in the pathogenesis of complex diseases such as metabolic disorders, neurological disorders, and inflammatory illnesses. In addition, TXNIP has gained significant attention due to its wide range of functions in energy metabolism, insulin sensitivity, improved insulin secretion, and also in the regulation of glucose and tumor suppressor activities in various cancers. This review aims to highlight the roles of TXNIP in the field of diabetology, neurodegenerative diseases, and inflammation. TXNIP is found to be a promising novel therapeutic target in the current review, not only in the aforementioned diseases but also in prolonged microvascular and macrovascular diseases. Therefore, TXNIP inhibitors hold promise for preventing the growing incidence of complications in relevant diseases.\n\n\nIntroduction\nThioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) was first identified in cancer cells as a vitamin D3 target gene and later known as vitamin D3 upregulated protein 1 (VDUP1). Its activity or expression is regulated at metabolically essential sites, such as liver cells, adipose tissues, and skeletal muscle, while it is most abundantly expressed in the glomeruli of human and rat kidneys [1]. TXNIP belongs to the \u03b1-arrestin protein family; these scaffolding intermediary proteins play key roles in multiple signaling pathways. TXNIP interacts directly with two cysteine (Cys) residues at the active catalytic site of reduced thioredoxin (TXN), further blocking its potential for scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). The interaction between reduced TXN and TXNIP through a disulfide linkage is essential for their basic protein-protein interaction. TXNIP further modulates TXN's protein structure while reorganizing de novo disulfide bond synthesis on Cys, with unique residues at positions 32 and 247, respectively [2,3].\nSeveral antioxidants, such as thioredoxin, glutaredoxin, and glutathione, help to maintain the activity of the TXN-system via a cell-based redox (reduction/oxidation) mechanism, which could face direct oxidative stress if ROS production is dysregulated [4]. The TXN system is an important regulator for the maintenance of a cellular reduced environment involving nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), TXN reductase, and TXNIP. TXNIP interacts with TXN and activates it as a negative regulator, which directly affects the redox balance [5]. TXNIP is involved in maintaining cell integrity by participating not only in proliferation, differentiation, autophagy, pyroptosis, inflammation, and 2 of 21 apoptosis but also modulating gene expression, metabolism, and redox reactions [6][7][8][9]. Several studies have revealed upregulation of TXNIP in diseases like type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [8], type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) [10], cardiovascular diseases [11], ischemic stroke, and cataract [9] as well as neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) [12,13]. Conversely, other studies have emphasized reduced TXNIP expression in tumor cells [14], mostly solid cancers [15,16]. Recent research has indicated its regulation via mechanistic controls such as heat shock and hypoxic conditions as well as biochemical controls,"

        "passage": " buy our tickets and hotel for this trip, and holy did it make it easier. We told them about the ferry tickets we wanted on Kakao, then they found and purchased everything. We paid them and got our ferry tickets in the chat. Same with the hotel \u2013 most hotels on Ulleungdo don\u2019t have websites so it means you\u2019d need to call. We basically told Ask Ajumma what we wanted and when. Then they got back us with options and we chose and paid. Even at the hotel when there was confusion with the check-in counter they called in and sorted everything out for us. It felt pretty good having concierge at our fingertip when we were on the go. Honestly, we\u2019ve used it a few other times and really recommend it for travelling Korea. Their Kakao ID is \u2018askajumma\u2019 if you\u2019re interested.\nA problem (or a blessing) with getting to Ulleungdo is the total absence of an airport. One must take a ferry from 1 of 3 ports on Korea\u2019s east coast. You can depart from Mukho, Pohang or Gangneung. Be sure to get your ticket in advanced if possible, since it\u2019s a hot item in travel season. The ferries were nice and modern. We had a window seat on the way there from Pohang, though we were boxed in by an ajumma/ajoshi party on the floor next to us. The older group hung out and drank the trip away despite attempts by the ferry staff to stop it. The ferry had a little snack bar with various Korean snack and ramen. As for the smoothness \u2013 the trip from Pohang went off without a hitch. You could barely feel it rocking. The way back to Mukho, however, was a different story! It was rocking pretty good and we had the sounds of seasickness all around us. So I\u2019d recommend the anti-sickness medicine on sale at the departure terminals if you have a weak stomach. Just ask for \uba40\ubbf8, pronounced mol-me, at the counter and you\u2019ll be all set! All the ferry contact info was on the map we got on the island. It\u2019s really useful so here\u2019s a photo of it if you need ferry times, prices and phone numbers. We found it had more information that we could find on the Ulleungdo travel site.\nThe first thing you need to do once you arrive at the island is find the tourism information booth and get your bus schedule and island map. My girlfriend and I found them extremely useful throughout the trip. After you walk off the terminal bridge turn left towards the police station and there\u2019s a tiny little booth giving out free maps and schedules to get started. Everything we did was done with either bus or taxi. Note, it was really difficult to get a taxi on the far side of the island, and we were once left waiting a couple of hours for a bus.\nThis one is a must. It was pictures of this walking trail that sealed the deal on Ulleungdo. A walkway has been laid around the rocky cliff shoreline between Dodong and Jeodong, allowing people to experience a landscape that was previously totally off limits. Blue water, black rocks, huge cliffs \u2013 this place is a great hike. For an added bonus, check it out at night for a view of the squid boats on the horizon, and listen to nothing but ocean waves.\nUlleungdo has numerous annual festivals, and some impromptu ones \u2013 which we were lucky to stumble onto. All the tourists turned out for the Dokdo Sovereignty concert to watch. Complete with pyrotechnics, kpop stars, and adorable performing children. There\u2019s even a famous squid festival where you can catch a squid with your bare hands (if that\u2019s your thing).\nAt the end of the bus line in Jeodong you can walk up to a beautiful waterfall where most of the community gets its drinking water from. It was SCORCHING hot when we went but a nice man selling photos up there offered to take our photo for free. He was full of photo ideas, that\u2019s for sure\u2026 Afterwards on the way down you pass a wind cave, where highly cooled air from underground jets out of a hole in the rocks to create an extremely cold cave to cool off. It was great after being outside in heatwave temperatures. People were napping inside and cooling their water bottles, too. The funny thing is in Korean it\u2019s literally referred to as Air Conditioning.\nThe Dokdo observatory is situated on top of a mountain peak that overlooks Dodong Harbour and is reached by a cable car a short walk from Dodong. It was still way too hot when we went up, but we made it to the 2 separate lookouts for some sweet photos of the town and island. It was too hazy to see Dokdo on our day, but the hikes and views were nice nonetheless. And who did we run into on top of this mountain lookout? The freakin\u2019 ajumma/ajoshi party from our ferry ride in. They were better this time and it was funny to recognize each other again and try to talk to each other.\nDepending on your location and transport options, it this could be a difficult one. Our hotel was in Jeodong and a short walk to the Haengnam walkway so we chose that spot. There are several other sunrise locations on the island though. Most would either require a car, a campout or an extremely early morning hike. We managed some great photos and it was incredibly peaceful.\nUlleungdo is one large volcanic relic.  The highest point in Seonginbong at 984 metres. From there you get a spectacular view of the entire island and the Nari Basin \u2013 the only flat land on the whole island. There are a few recommended routes by the Korean tourism site. I recommend the KBS relay station as a starting point. We had told our taxi driver to take us to the foot of Daewonsa Temple but he said it was too steep and suggested we go to the KBS starting point. It was definitely a better choice, as we climbed at least 100 m in the car before going out a foot. It was a welcome reduction in the hike given how hot it was. From Jeodon it was only 10,000W to the KBS Relay station. We hiked down into the Nari Basin on the way down, and effectively crossed the island on foot. From the basin there is a bus to Chunbu or you could walk. Be sure to check out the traditional houses scattered in the basin while you\u2019re there, too!\nAfter we caught our bus out of the Nari Basin, we found ourselves in Cheonbu \u2013 the bus terminal point of the far side of the island. Nearby people were swimming and there was an underwater observatory. It was a building at the end of a long pier with an elevator that took you 6 metres under the under to watch hundreds of fish and sea creatures swimming on by. It was actually pretty cool and no one was in the ticket booth on the day we went so it was also free!\n9. Go Swimming!\nUlleungdo is an island. It might not be filled with white sand beaches, or even and sandy beaches, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t find a beautiful spot to cool off. We swam at a few different locations, and each one had breathtaking scenery. Rocks jutted out of the ocean and were surrounded by cliffs on all sides, with very few people to spoil it. The downside of these beaches is their composition \u2013 they are mostly made of large rounded pebbles that are hard to walk on and a little slippery. We did find one beach that was very small pebbles that didn\u2019t hurt your feet.\nThere was a great beach near the village of Tonggumi and Gajaegul-bawi. It had the small rocks which were easy to step on, and was enclosed by two enormous rocks on either side, creating a secluded feeling. Around us were some other families, diving classes, and people diving for seafood. Highly recommend!\nAnother beach was near Gwaneumdo Island. We ended up waiting for a couple hours for a bus and decided to go for a dip. The rocks were clean and the water was so warm! To get to the water, you need to walk behind the building and you\u2019ll see an old staircase leading down to the shoreline. It\u2019s a great spot if you have time to kill, there\u2019s shade, bathrooms, and food trucks.\nThere is a list of boat tours available on the map. The most popular trip travels around the entire island in about 2 hours, showing the stunning rock formations. You can buy tickets for it from a ticket booth just outside the main Dodong ferry terminal. It turns out when we went that the ship was undergoing maintenance and wasn\u2019t doing tours! We had an idea though and caught a ferry from Jeodong port to Gwaneumdo. For 4,000W each it took us towards the recently opened Gwaneumdo island. On the 30 minute boat ride we saw some great views of Ulleungdo and even nicer parts of Gwaneumdo. This included a pirate cave which was thought to be a refuge for pirates back in the day. And everyone feeds the seagulls on the boat! People came with snacks and held them up off the back of the boat. Seagulls would swoop in and snag them from your hand. A friendly korean person offered us some snacks to feed the birds with, which is more fun than it looks. I really recommend doing some"

The flame has already gone through Ulleungdo, Baengnyeongdo and Jejudo islands and has now arrived on the mainland. The torch relay will continue along its course and arrive at the main stadium in Incheon for the opening ceremony on September 19. The \"Light of Peace\" will stay lit throughout the games.\nOn August 14, the flame arrived on Baeknyeongdo Island, the northernmost South Korean island in the Yellow Sea. A total of 106 fishing boats sounded their klaxons to greet the flame. Some 55 participants consisting of residents, marines and students ran a 3.4 kilometer relay. They ran hoping for peace and the reunification of the Korean Peninsula. Then the flame left the island and headed to Jejudo Island via airplane.\nThe flame arrived on Jejudo Island and traveled a total of 4.8 kilometers, divided into 16 sections. Female divers, police officers on horseback, disabled people and boys and girls who are already heads of their own households, as well as foreign residents, all took part in the relay, taking in the beautiful scenery of the island.\nThe flame arrived on Uleungdo Island on August 18. Five torch bearers, including residents, athletes and students, ran 2.5 kilometers, divided into five sections. Residents welcomed the arrival of the torch despite bad weather and showed their support for the upcoming Asian Games.\n\"Incheon is far away from Ulleungdo Island, but I wanted to contribute to the Asian Games and so I applied,\" said Kim Min-gu, a student. \"I am glad to become a torch bearer and I hope that the Incheon games will be successful.\"\nThe torch left the island and arrived in Gyeongju, Gyeongsangbuk-do (North Gyeongsang Province), the next day on August 19. Torch bearers ran 1.5 kilometers in Gyeongju. Some 41 participants ran along eight sections around the city and arrived in front of Gyeongju City Hall.\nSix foreign residents took part in the relay for the Asian Games, representing a continent of 4.5 billion people. There were welcoming ceremonies, such as a b-boy dance performance, musical performances that were a fusion of traditional Korean music and modern pop music, and a boys and girls choir performance. There was also asamulnori performance of the traditional percussion quartet.\nThe flame later arrived in Ulsan on August 19. Torch bearers ran from the Ulsan Culture Art Center to Ulsan City Hall, a total of 1.6 kilometers, divided into 13 sections. Ulsan residents waved and applauded, hoping for a successful hosting of the games. The torch bearers ran to cultural spots across the city to entertain the spectators. The flame arrived at Ulsan City Hall and there was a traditional dance performance by the Ulsan municipal dance company.\n\"The gathering of the flame atop Manisan Mountain, a sacred place for the Korean people, is to wish for a successful hosting of the games and to hope for peace,\" said an organizing committee official. \"Now it is united with the flame from New Delhi and it will be lit throughout the games.\"<|endoftext|>This 29 Sea Ray has a double berth forward, convertible dinette to port with a mid-cabin sporting a double berth and full galley on the stbd side.

Also, those gridlines and the shape of Ulleungdo make me wonder how Seoul National University dated THIS MAP, which is believed to have been made sometime between 1750 and 1768.\nMaybe, someone should go back and reevaluate some of these maps?\nActually, this map is a little confusing for me since the name \u8d8a\u677e (Weolsong) comes just before \u9b31\u9675\u5cf6\u9577 (Ulleungdo-Jang) on the map, which suggests that the Ulleungdo-Jang was from Weolsong. If that is true, then the map should be dated from 1888 to 1894.\nI am not exactly sure how to interpret all the writing, so I think more study is needed.\nI especially interested in the \"1859-65.19C\u4e2d\u671f\u3000\u6771\u8f3f\u3000\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6 \uff08\u5199\u672c\uff09\" which Korean National Central Museum (\u97d3\u56fd\u56fd\u7acb\u4e2d\u592e\u535a\u7269\u9928) owns.\nIt also has gridline but the picture is somewhat blurred.\nTha map was made in Japan but the information was brought by Kim Okgyun (\u91d1\u7389\u5747, \uae40\uc625\uade0), the Korean reformist. The map showed the Argonaut island as Takeshima and Ullengdo (Dagelet) as Matsushima. There is no mentioning of Liancourt rocks. So this map means that one of the intellectual Koreans in those days who once worked in Ulleungdo didn't know about Liancourt rocks.\nKim Ok-gyun was not only a Korean intellectual; he was the man in charge of moving settlers to Ulleungdo until he had to flee Korea in 1884, which means he should have known better than anyone the situation on Ulleungdo in 1884. And since his map did not show Liancourt Rocks, we can assume that he either did not know of the rocks or did not consider them to be a part of Korean territory.\nYes, I read Aki's post, which was very good.\nFor example, the 1865 map which was made in Paris indicated Ousan precisely just next to Ulleungdo.\nI saw some German-made maps of Korea which were made in 1892, 1894 & 1897.\nAll these maps are very accurate, as they show Ulleungdo as \"Matsushima (Dagelet I.)\" and Liancourt rocks as \"Liancourt Rocks (Hornet rocks)\", and they don't include the ghost island of Argonaut.\nAdditionally, all these maps coloured both \"Matsushima (Dagelet I)\" and \"Liancourt rocks (Hornet rocks)\" as the same colour as Japan.\nIt seems that western countries in those days recognised as Ulleungdo as Japanese territory, although this was not true, but which may mean that there is no chance for Korea to claim that Liancourt rocks to be their territory.\nP.S. I got a few of these maps from e-Bay recently.\nInteresting maps, Pacifist. I have bookmarked that page.\nI think we have already talked about one of the maps HERE.\nBy the way, did you see the maps on the link that Kaneganese told us about HERE?\nYes, I saw some of the maps in the site (of Alabama Univ) and noticed that although American maps usually conveyed Argonaut I (as Take I.) until early 20th century (1902-1903), German maps (printed in Leipzig) excluded Argonaut I even in 1890's.\nP.S. Some maps can be seen too in the following Texas site, although not so many.\nTo follow is American-made map of Korea. It doesn't include Liancourt rocks, although it includes Ulleungdo.\n\"I am not exactly sure how to interpret all the writing, so I think more study is needed.\"\nI couldn't really understand what you are trying to say\u3000(Sorry...), but if you are not so sure about the year when the map was made right now, maybe the title sould be written as \"1884 - 1888?.... \" in order to avoid any confusion for the readers at least until you become sure about it? I think it would be more friendly to the readers. Not everyone read comment section. But posting your ideas and findings itself is great since it would give us a chance to study more about the map, and hopefully, someone gives us more information about it.\nGood idea, Kaneganese, but I think I will put \"1884 - 1994\" without a question mark since I am pretty sure of that date.\nAnyway, what I was trying to say was that if the \"Ulleungdo-Jang\" (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6\u9577) was the \"Manho\" (\u842c\u6236) out of Weolsong-jin (\u8d8a\u677e\u93ad), then that would mean the map could be dated between 1888 and 1895 since that was the time the Weolsong-jin Manho was Ulleungdo-Jang.\nBetween 1884 and 1888, the Camp Commander at Samcheok replaced the Ulleungdo-Jang, but was called \"Ulleungdo Cheomsa,\" instead.\nIf you look at the writing on the map, you will see that \"Weolsong\" (\u8d8a\u677e) is written just before, which would suggest he was out of Weolsong, but in small letters next to \"Ulleungdo-Jang\" (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6\u9577) is written \"Pyeonghae, Samcheok-po Jin\" (\u5e73\u6d77\u4e09\u4e09\u965f\u6d66\u93ad), which suggests he was out of Samcheok-po Jin. Do you see my confusion now?\nThe fact that Ulleungdo appeared on the Samcheok map makes me believe that the map was made when the Ulleungdo-Jang was the Samcheok commander, which was between 1884 and 1888. The only problem with that is that he was not called \"Ulleungdo-Jang,\" but was called \"Ulleungdo Cheomsa.\" However, I am thinking that \"Ulleungdo-Jang\" could have been his unofficial title since he replace the previous Ulleungdo-Jang.\nYes, I know it is a little confusing.\nAt any rate, I think we can safely say the map was made between 1884 and 1894. I stopped it at 1894, instead of 1895, because that was the upper limit for the map given by Koryo University, who probably had a good reason for dating it up to 1894.\nSo, I think this means this was the last Korean map of Ulleungdo made before the 1900 Imperial Edict that made Ulleungdo and her neighboring islands a county of Gangwon Province. Of course, it is possible that U Yong-jeong (\u79b9\u7528\u9f0e) made a map of Ulleungdo that we do not know about since he inspected the island in 1900, before the edict was proclaimed.\nI got it finally. Besides, as long as \"\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6\u9577\" is listed, it is highly unlikely to be made 1700's, in the first place, right?\n\"I think I will put \"1884 - 1994\" without a question mark since I am pretty sure of that date.\"\nYou mean \"1884 - 1894\"? As long as you are sure about it, yes, it's good. Anyway, good find, Gerry. By the way, isn't it possible to send some question to Koryo University to ask how they defined the year of the map was made, like Shimane prefecture site?\nI'm not sure if this non-official map has anything to do with 1900 Imperial Edict or not, but the text on the map does include some new information on Usando and Ulleungdo, so it is a very important for us. I really hope Korean make all the documents \u79b9\u7528\u9f0e supposed to submit to Korean government public.\nYes, I meant 1884 to 1894. Sorry.\nIf Koryo University dated the map between 1835 and 1894, then that means they do not know the date of the map.\nKorean maps are usually dated by the name change of some village or mountain that is recorded in Korean records. If the map reflects that change, or does not reflect it, then scholars can use that to narrow down the date of Korean maps. In the case of this map, the person looking at it obviously overlooked the mention of \"Ulleungdo-Jang\" (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6\u9577) because that is a clear indicator that the map was made after 1883.\nI guess there is someone at Koryo University who may know about this map, but I think we now know more about it than he or she does. Even the Dokdo Museum could only date"

There are no transportation methods to Ulleungdo Island apart from passenger ships and upon arrival, rent car companies and customers both frequently experience difficulties in confirming reservations and assigning cars. Accordingly, Car More revealed that from 5th September, it can solve real time the rent car reservation and payment using its application that targets tourists visiting Ulleungdo and Dokdo Islands.\nCar More supports a reservation system that supports the unique characteristics of the Ulleungdo Island region. If the customer inserts the departing port and departing time of the ship through the application, the available cars can be viewed and once reserved, it can find beforehand the Ulleungdo Island port that the customer will arrive at.

I am by no means an expert, but I have kept several of this species for some years, so I do have a bit of experience with them. I currently own four IJs (Irian Jayas) and will hopefully have babies that I produced in a month or two.\nThe Irian Jaya Blue-Tongued Skink (Tiliqua sp.) does not currently have a species designation (I had to put this review under Tiliqua scincoides since there was no option for the Irian Jaya). They originate from the Irian Jaya province of Indonesia and come in a wide variety of patterns and colours.\nAppearance: Irian Jayas are arguably one of the most variable blue tongue (at least outside of Australia) in terms of colour and pattern. Some are darker with browns and blacks, some have pinks and yellows, some are very orange; there is a huge amount of combinations. Pattern-wise, some IJs will look more like \"gigas\" (Indonesian blue tongues), and some will look more \"scincoides\" (such as Tanimbars, Northerns, and Eastern blue tongues).\nHandling/Temperament: In general, blue tongues tame down fairly well. Out of my four IJs, one of them is very interactive and \"social\", one is less interactive but still curious and explorative, one tries to avoid humans but will investigate what someone is doing occasionally, and one is terrified of people. From my experiences and what I've seen with other people, IJs, and blue tongues in general, typically are very curious and will investigate what you are doing, but the levels of interactivity will depend on the individual. Your best bet on getting a blue tongue that is more likely to be friendly toward people is to buy captive bred from a reputable breeder. Most IJs in the pet trade will be wild caught or captive born (pregnant female was imported and gave birth in captivity). However, the amount of people breeding IJs is increasing. If you are outside of Australia, Northern blue tongues (Tiliqua scincoides intermedia) should always be captive bred since Australia does not allow export of their reptiles. When it comes to handling, some blue tongues will sit still, and some will always want to move.\nVisibility/activity level: This can depend on the individual to some extent. Many blue tongues like to bury themselves in substrate and sometimes won't come out for a day or two. Some will cruise around their enclosure fairly often, whereas others are lazy lumps.\nHabitat: The set up for these guys is simple. The standard for blue tongues may vary between continents/count"

        "passage": " with both staking claim to the island. In 1905 Japan incorporated the island into its territory by claiming that it was terra nullius (land belonging to no one). Korea was a Japanese protectorate at the time and in no position to object.\nAfter World War II, the San Francisco Peace Treaty of 1952 explicitly gave Korea control of Jeju, Ulleungdo and Geommun-do, but Dokdo was left out of the agreement completely and the islands have been under de facto Korean control ever since. To this day, Japan continues to claim their sovereignty which proves to be a very sore point in Japan-Korea relations.\nAccess to visitors was limited until Japan's Shimane prefecture declared a \"Takeshima Day\", inflaming the already volatile situation. The Korean government responded by opening the island up to tourists on March 24, 2005. Since then, an average of 80,000 visitors visit the island every year.\nA fisherman by trade, Kim Sung-Do and his wife Kim Shin-Yeol are the only permanent residents on the island. There are also a small dispatch of security police officers, representatives from the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries and three lighthouse keepers who reside there on rotation.\nJapanese citizens should check in advance before attempting to travel to Dokdo. All other nationalities should have no issue.\nQuestions (in Korean) can be directed to the Ulleungdo and Dokdo Administrative Office under the telephone number |||PHONE_NUMBER||| ~6.\nTo get to Dokdo, you must first get to Ulleungdo. There is only one charter company that has boats ferrying you to and fro. The Dae-A-Express has two ports, Pohang in North Gyeongsang-do and Mukho in Gangwon-do. From Pohang, it takes about three hours to get to Ulleungdo from the mainland. It takes a little less time from Mukho, about two and a half hours. The boats leave once a day. From Pohang the ticket fare is \u20a958,000. From Mukho it's a little cheaper at \u20a949,000.\nThe Dae-A-Express and the Tour and Shipping Company [dead link] operate ferries to Dokdo. There are three boats that leave daily. However the ferry schedule is subject to frequent changes. So it is advisable to reserve seats to Dokdo before reserving them to Ulleungdo. Prices range from \u20a942,000 to \u20a945,000.\nThe island is tiny, and you can access everything by foot.\nDokdo is an important part of modern Korean national identity, but doesn't actually have much, if anything, to offer foreign tourists. If you like the idea of a long and bumpy sea trip followed by views of an interesting rocky outcrop then it may be for you, but be aware it is a rather niche destination generally.\nThe small island is mainly volcanic rock with patches of lush grass. The two islets that make up Dokdo, each have their own particular features. Seodo (West islet), the smaller of the two, is where the fisherman and his wife live. Their house is at the bottom of the steep cliffs. Dongdo (East islet) has a large crater at the top that runs right to the water. The other highlight is the \"Hyeongje\" Cave. It is also where the security officers are stationed. Between the two is another cave, the \"Cheonjang-gul\".\nBecause the warm and cool currents converge in the surrounding area, a great variety of fish thrive there. Also Dokdo is home to a multitude of birds. One of the reasons the island was closed off to the public was to preserve the natural ecology. Dokdo meaning is rock island and alone island.\nTypically you would have just 20 minutes to look around, so just some limited walking is possible.\nSince the island is so far from the mainland, the weather can get extremely erratic and at times the boats will not run because sea storms or choppy water. It is prudent to call ahead of time.\nMany Koreans are concerned about the possibility of a military attack by Japan in order to reclaim the islands. Whilst Japan does indeed contend the ownership of the islands very strongly, any suggestion of military action is extremely farfetched.\nThe three main South Korean Telecom Providers (KT, SK and LG) offer fast LTE internet connectivity over their mobile phone networks, with dedicated base stations on the rocks.\nOn the same boat back to the island of Ulleungdo.\nThis city travel guide to Dokdo is a usable article.

You can have your entire world delivered to you a la carte, all while you have an international meeting from your living room! Millennials have turned the traditional work environment into an RSS feed.\nThe world has changed, but communication and information has become better, more accessible and yielded more models for working together than ever before.\nBut, Why Don\u2019t They Like Face to Face?\nThe real rub with Millennials is not the ease and accessibility they desire for much of life\u2019s basic needs. It\u2019s more the communication preferences that seem to have most folks irked. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t like speaking, it\u2019s that they recognize it\u2019s a skill set many have not mastered. We gravitate towards things we like doing and we usually like doing thing that we are skilled at.\nGrowing up, I was eager to learn handwriting. Cursive was par for the course in 4th grade, and I loved it. Later when word processing really came on the scene, I learned to type like a madwoman. Pagers opened up a world of secret codes: 143 means \u201cI love you\u201d and 121 means \u201cI need to talk to you\u201d. And then Nokia\u2019s came on the scene and texting started to change our world. And true to form, just like everything else, we found a faster, more efficient way to do something. Why spell out y-o-u when U communicates just as much? With each new innovation, we learned and adapted to the language of the time. It took a full school year to learn cursive and only after spending PreK through 3rd learning how to print.\nFast forward to 2017, I can learn to make a meme from my phone in a matter of minutes and then post it to the world to convey an emotion or idea to people I have never met before. That\u2019s powerful, and it\u2019s easy to master.\nMaybe, the best way to get Millennials to speak to you is to start a conversation. I guarantee both parties will walk away better for it.\nFacebook, Twitter, and Instagram have helped us connect more, and not just communicate with words, but with images like memes, emojis, and live video. If a picture is worth a thousand words, my generation has taught us all how to say more in a 40 second video or well constructed photo collage, than anyone else. That\u2019s doing more with less. That\u2019s efficiency in action.\nThe advances in written communication astound us, but spoken communication has not advanced in the same way. In person communication is still nuanced, and full of human subjectivity, cultural bias, non verbal cues and anxieties. Regardless of when you were born, the spoken word, though intensely powerful when done well, is most often done terribly wrong, and is riddled with physical signs of anxiety \u2013 sweaty palms, heart palpitations, nausea, panic \u2013 for the speaker.\nThe fix? There are some great public speaking courses out there that address raising your skill in this area. But, while waiting to join Toastmasters or take a course to Own the Room, maybe, the best way to get Millennials to speak to you, is to start a conversation. I guarantee both parties will walk away better for it.\nBaby Boomers and Gen X-ers would have you believe, that Gen Y (the Millennials) has ruined the world, and made it overly complicated, but doesn\u2019t every generation come to a point where they wish for \u201csimpler times\u201d and curse \u201ckids today\u201d? Change is uncomfortable. We all get that. The only difference is now, those \u201ckids\u201d are at work, sitting across the table from you, running the cool exciting start up you just joined, and vying for leadership positions. And those \u201ckids\u201d communicate differently. Don\u2019t be mad that Millennials are changing the world of work. Be happy they have found new ways to communicate \u2013 and then learn the language so you aren\u2019t left in the dark.\n Reclaim your millennialism. Talking \u2018bout my generation? You should. We are awesome and we are forever changing the world. Millennials stand up!\nWhat\u2019s your preferred communication method"

U.S. small caps (Russell 2000 Index) have been the worst performing index for two straight weeks while emerging market equities (MSCI EM) also lost ground. Real estate and consumer staples were the top performing sectors whereas consumer discretionary and communication services lost ground this week.\nThe S&P 500 Index forward price-to-earnings ratio (PE) is at over 21 and presently 35% above its 10-year average. Looking at the developed international markets, the PE for the MSCI EAFE Index is 17, which is 23% above its long-term average. The story is the same for emerging markets (EM) equities, with the MSCI Emerging Markets (EM) Index PE over 14, 27% above its long-term average. Despite the recent rise in interest rates, LPL Research continues to believe low interest rate levels support elevated valuations globally.\nBonds, as represented by the Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate, gained ground this week as the 10-year Treasury yield moved lower. Many other bond sectors also moved in tandem, as investors took advantage of lower bond prices.\nAfter a strong year thus far, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Crude Oil sold off for the third straight week. In addition, natural gas recovered after a two week selloff. Moreover, the major metals, gold, silver and copper, ended lower this week.\nThe Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) increased 0.2% month over month in February. February\u2019s gains in the LEI were generally broad-based among their indicators. While this suggests future economic growth ahead, the LEI fell short of expectations.\nSales of new homes last month fell over 15%, but they remained higher than February 2020. Poor weather was blamed for the drop in home sales. Higher rates could be a culprit, but given tight inventories and demographics, the market should remain solid.\nThis week jobless claims beat estimates as over 680,000 Americans filed for unemployment. This was better than the Bloomberg consensus forecast of 730,000 and the lowest level since pre-COVID 19. In addition continuing claims fell to over 3.8 million vs. the Bloomberg consensus of over 4 million.<|endoftext|>Perfect service, professional and friendly staff The Pho Hoi II Hotel is well known for perfect service, professional and friendly staff.

But he still refused to apologise for any action he took over the past number of years. \"In relation to my own position, of course I don't claim I got everything right in my political career. Only a fool would suggest that. But I do say I take full responsibility for them,\" he said.\nShortly after that, however, Justice Minister Dermot Ahern, admitted the Government could not afford to go ahead with the plans for the massive prison complex. \"What is now needed is a new project which reflects the current economic and fiscal realities and protects the taxpayers' interests,\" he said.\nThe Prison Service said the project \"was simply unaffordable at the price being quoted\".\nThe ditching of the existing Thornton Hall plans immediately drew comparisons with previous cases where money was squandered -- the e-voting machines and the failed PPARS computer project.\nThe site for Thornton Hall, a 150-acre greenfield plot at Kilsallaghan near Swords, was bought in controversial circumstances for \u20ac30m in 2005 to replace Mountjoy, which inspectors branded unacceptable and unfit for inmates.\nThe price per acre was far higher than any other land sales in the area at that time.\nAlmost \u20ac11m has already been spent on consultants' fees for the Thornton Hall scheme.\nA row over the cost of the massive new jail complex led to the state body responsible for running the country's prisons breaking off talks with the project's preferred bidder.\nAnd it is now expected that the original plan will be replaced by a far cheaper and scaled down version of the multi-jail campus.\nThe Department of Justice also confirmed that the project was unaffordable at the price quoted by preferred bidder Leargas and a more affordable solution was required.\nMr Ahern said the Government was still strongly committed to pressing ahead with a prison development at Thornton Hall and, in the meantime, the problem of increasing bed capacity in the nation's jails would be tackled by the provision of an extra 400 prison spaces this summer.\nBut the opposition parties dismissed Mr Ahern's claims and said the Thornton Hall project was PPARS and the e-voting machines all over again.\nFine Gael justice spokesman Charlie Flanagan said the announcement to abandon the plan was an indictment of the Government's incompetence.\nEarlier yesterday, Mr Cowen claimed the worldwide economic downturn hit just when the Government was going to address the economy's over-reliance on construction.\nMr Cowen said the Government had recognised by 2007 the dangers posed by its heavy dependence on housing-related taxes and revenue.\nHe said it was about to plan for a"

In the picture, from left to right, Hans-Juergen Koch, Executive VP, Business Area Industry, Management and Automation, Phoenix Contact Electronics GmbH, Friedrich Wegener, Specialist Software Standardization, Phoenix Contact, Oliver Winzenried, CEO and Founder, WIBU-SYSTEMS AG, Roland Bent, General Manager, Phoenix Contact. \u00a9 Phoenix Contact.\nPhoenix Contact, a global market leader and innovator in the field of electrical engineering, electronics and automation, and Wibu-Systems, a global leader in secure license lifecycle management for business and industrial environments, announce the integration of their flagship technologies at the Hannover Messe 2018. CodeMeter, the comprehensive solution for protection, licensing, and security, has been selected by Phoenix Contact as the best-in-class technology to streamline license and entitlement management of their PLCnext control system solution.\nPC Worx Engineer, known as the comprehensive programming software engineering solution suitable for lots of Phoenix Contact controllers, can be used to implement complex automation concepts and is therefore offered in different payable or free of charge versions, available with additional add-ins. In a global scenario influenced by the emergence of Industrie 4.0 and with captains of industry shifting their attention from hardware to software in the value chain, a centralized license lifecycle management solution became of the essence.\nIn this first stage of the project, Phoenix Contact has focused primarily on the ability to offer their software in a modular, scalable, and efficient fashion. Additionally, their requirements included the need to protect their digital know-how and support the different ERP implementations that were installed at their various locations around the globe.\nCodeMeter was able to completely fulfill their expectations. With AxProtector.NET, they automatically encrypt classes and methods of their software and shield it with a safety shell against piracy and reverse engineering. With CmActLicense, an encrypted and signed file, they bind the license of their software to a fingerprint of the target system. Alternatively, they can associate licenses with CmDongle hardware secure elements that come in several form factors, including USB sticks, memory cards, and ASICs. With CodeMeter License Central, they create, deliver, and manage standalone, network, demo, and emergency licenses of their software and its add-ons.\nThe ERP integration challenge was overcome with the use of CodeMeter License Central Connector, which made it possible for Phoenix Contact to interface their enterprise resource planning systems ranging from different versions of SAP to Baan with Wibu-Systems\u2019 online database derived solution. Orders for PC Worx Engineer are sent from the worldwide subsidiary offices of Phoenix Contact to the SAP system located at their headquarters, and processed almost instantaneously.\nOliver Winzenried, CEO and founder of Wibu-Systems, is excited by the opportunities that have come forth from this first step in cooperation: \u201cData driven applications, cloud centric platforms, and security technologies are fueling the current IT spending of companies; these are not mere costs though, but rather an investment in a digital, global, and secure marketplace. Our fruitful collaboration with Phoenix Contact reflects the digital transformation of the engineering field and a new business approach built on immediate and diversified responses to the market needs\u201d.<|endoftext|>\u201cThe Sea That Shall Not Be Named\u201d?\nYonhap News is reporting that David Wynford, the chairman of the general meeting of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), has proposed to Japan and Korea that the name of sea between the two countries be completely omitted in the fourth edition of the IHO oceanographic chart. Mr Wynford then requested that Seoul, Pyongyang, and Tokyo submit their official positions on his proposal after studying it on their own.\n\n\nI seriously wonder if he\u2019s not taking the piss here.\nAccording to NAVER\u2019s article which seems deleted, Korean representatives were waiting for other country\u2019s representatives in front of the building every morning and at the doors of rest rooms and smoking rooms any time.\nBy the way, there is clearly indicated \u2018Mer de Japon\u2019 in the map which they exibited to claim Dokto was their territory.\nNot only does the 1894 map you linked to show the sea labeled as \u201cMer de Japon,\u201d the island on the map it claims to be \u201cDokdo\u201d is actually Ulleungdo and its neighboring island of Jukdo. If it is not Ulleungdo, then where is Ulleungdo on the map?\nI think exploring new place or finding new species and naming it \u201cKorean \u25cb\u25cb\u201d or \u201cChosen \u00d7\u00d7\u201d would be a bit more constructive and contributing against the world. Rewiting and redrawing the maps and documents that exists now seems (to me) plenty much waste of time and money. I wonder who is going to shoulder the costs.\nAt all, IOC surrendered for the paranoiac stalking,,, oh typing mistake, sorry,,,,considerate elegant grace-full behavior of South Korea.\nThey are surely proud.\nI can do nothing but smile wryly.\nI\u2019m getting tired of Westerners pussyfooting around these \u201csensitive\u201d issues. What has happened? Why can\u2019t we recognise a manufactured controversy when we see one?\nTo all the blog readers. I urge you to write Dr David Wynford Williams an email urging him to reverse his drastic and illogical experement.\nI would also like to put forth a new name for that body of land beteeen China and Japan in East Asia. It should be called ho-rea.\nHe may also want to know about Ho-rean culinary tips.\nI googled about it but right now, only Sankei (among Japanese media) seems to report about the issue and it is only quoting Korean media. I cannot get the whole perspective. What has happened? And do you think Korean source reliable?\nBy the way, are you suggesting to act like Vank? Isn`t it better to wait until the Japanese government announces something?\nThanks for asking Egg.\nKorean sources (north, south and Kyopo) are not usually reliable. Koreans will lie about anything as long as meets their goals.\nI only suggest people tell the truth about Korea.\nSo sorry if my words sounded like a teacher. No intention of that but please forgive me if it was.\nAfter reading the Korean Dong Ilbo, I think I agree with you Egg. Spamming the good doctor would just lower the Japanese position to the Koreas level.\nJukdo is the island where bamboos had grown wild and so was named such, Chikuto in Japanese pronucation, isn\u2019t it?\nThe other pronunciation of the same Chinese characters is Takeshima, which is confused by Koreans.\nBy the way, Korean delegation of IHO was said to incur antipathy from other country\u2019s delegations that were annoyed at 200 e-mails a day from Korean address.\nMr. Shiozaki, the Chief Cabinet Secretary of Japan held a press conference and told that the proposal by chairman of the IHO was not decided.\nI am relieved for a moment.\nAnd in the movie \u2018The Departed\u2019, they had some nice vocabulary that I\u2019d like to try using on somebody. Will you take the honor to be that \u2018somebody\u2019?\nYou\u2019re not a Japanese, are you?\nAnd in the movie \u2018The Departed\u2019, they had some nice vocabulary that I\u2019d like to try using on somebody. Will you take the honor to be that \u2019somebody\u2019?\nHere. This might help you.\nbefore the annexation.\nScroll down, you can see Korean official reports and textbook of Korean geography before the annexation.\nDr David Wynford Williams should be fired.\nNot quite. The Sea of Japan will continue to be called the Sea of Japan.\nThe International Hydrographic Organization, faced with opposition from Tokyo, has put off voting on its chairman\u2019s proposal to delete the \u201cSea of Japan\u201d appellation from an IHO chart for the body of water that South Korea wants called \u201cEast Sea,\u201d Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuhisa Shiozaki said Friday.\nPerhaps \u201cworthless asshole\u201d is too much. He is, however, either spineless, gullible or scared.\nThe name \u201cThe Sea of Japan\u201d(\u65e5\u672c\u6d77) was used in \ub300\ud55c\uc9c0\uc9c0(\u5927\u97d3\u5730\u5fd7)(1899), Korean Government\u2019s report and newspaper.\nThen, we can doubtlessly judge that the insistence of South Korea is a flat-out lie.\nOf cause, South Korean Government knows this facts.\nSo I can openly call her concerning this issue as \u201cLiar\u201d and \u201cChildish selfishness\u201d.\n"

Ulleungdo is Korea\u2019s administrative and military defense base for Dokdo, which the Japanese call Takeshima.\n\u201cWe\u2019re closely monitoring the situation after learning from news media about the Japanese lawmakers\u2019 plan for a visit,\u201d Yonhap News quoted an unidentified ministry official as saying.\nLast week, Shindo Yoshitaka, a lawmaker of Japan\u2019s opposition Liberal Democratic Party, told a press conference in Tokyo that he would tour Ulleungdo on Aug. 2-3, along with three other DLP lawmakers.\n\u201cWe will go see ourselves why Koreans do things that we, the Japanese, can not accept,\u201d Japan\u2019s Kyodo News Agency quoted the lawmaker as saying.\nHe referred to the Korean move to strengthen sovereignty of Dokdo through Ulleungdo. Seoul, which keeps a naval defense base in Ulleungdo, plans to build a maritime research center on the island, with some facilities to be installed on nearby Dokdo.\nThe planned Ulleungdo visit comes amid aggravated bilateral relations after Korea\u2019s flag carrier conducted a test flight over Dokdo last month.\nTokyo told its officials not to fly with Korean Air for a month starting Monday and Seoul on Friday requested it revoke the boycott.<|endoftext|>DROP TABLE Habitantes;\nDROP TABLE Km2;\nDROP TABLE Municipios;\nDROP TABLE provincias;\nDROP TABLE CCAA;\n\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Habitantes (\n\tID_MUN\tINTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE,\n\tHyM\tINTEGER NOT NULL,\n\tHombres\tINTEGER NOT NULL,\n\tMujeres\tINTEGER NOT NULL,\n\tPRIMARY KEY(ID_MUN)\n);\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Km2 (\n\tID_MUN\tINTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE,\n\tSuperficie\tREAL NOT NULL,\n\tPRIMARY KEY(ID_MUN)\n);\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Municipios (\n\tID_MUN\tINTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE,\n\tNombre\tTEXT NOT NULL,\n\tF_Inscripcion\tTEXT,\n\tID_PRV\tINTEGER NOT NULL,\n\tN_Municipio\tINTEGER NOT NULL,\n\tPRIMARY KEY(ID_MUN)\n);\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Provincias (\n\tID_PRV\tINTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT UNIQUE,\n\tNombre\tTEXT NOT NULL,\n\tID_CCAA\tINTEGER NOT NULL\n);\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS CCAA (\n\tID_CCAA\tINTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE,\n\tNombreId\tTEXT,\n\tNombre\tTEXT,\n\tPRIMARY KEY(ID_CCAA)\n);\nINSERT INTO Habitantes VALUES (1001,2882,1491,1391),\n (1002,10263,5099,5164),\n (1003,1518,797,721),\n (1004,1829,908,921),\n (1006,244,123,121),\n (1008,997,542,455),\n (1009,1647,834,813),\n (1010,2927,1477,1450),\n (1011,311,169,142),\n (1013,905,500,405),\n (1014,467,237,230),\n (1016,526,312,214),\n (1017,1069,565,504),\n (1018,1765,953,812),\n (1019,182,98,84),\n (1020,362,209,153),\n (1021,608,318,290),\n (1022,1051,521,530),\n (1023,353,175,178),\n (1027,509,281,228),\n (1028,1471,759,712),\n (1030,163,87,76),\n (1031,1520,782,738),\n (1032,679,350,329),\n (1033,860,449,411),\n (1034,216,107,109),\n (1036,18300,9046,9254),\n (1037,712,404,308),\n (1039,233,117,116),\n ("

The enhancement system is super frustrating. I have about 300 hours in the game and at this point I've stopped trying to upgrade. It does feel super bad to grind for awhile just to LOSE progress. This is my problem with it. I think if the common broke the gear so you have to repair, but didnt lose a fortification, it would be much better. Or maybe have an item you can include with the upgrade for better chance at success. The glaring issue is that the enhancement system doesnt respect the time you put in, even for the most dedicated players.  If there isnt content to do after the prestige quest grind, then that is a fault on the devs for releasing an unfinished game. They should at least set that expectation up front because right now it just feels like they're haulting progress intentionally to slow people down. That in itself is all good, except now that I'm hearing theres no content after that til may, I'm pretty salty. I'm tired of running the same content (regionals, dailies) for the past two weeks.

See HERE\"\nFollowing this, many Japanese who believed there to be a Japanese island called \"Matsushima\" (\u677e\u5cf6) in the sea of Japan started sending numerous petitions to Minstry of Foreign Affairs between 1876 and 1878 asking that they be allowed to develop the island. Though Japanese in the Edo era had been clearly aware of the locations of Takeshima (\u7af9\u5cf6 = today's Ulleungdo) and Matsushima (\u677e\u5cf6 = today's Takeshima/Liancourt Rocks/Dokdo), the non-existent island on Western maps called \"Argonaut\" and the turmoil in the Japanese government following the fall of the Edo Shogunate caused confusion and debate on the names and locations of islands in the Sea of Japan between Japan and Korea. See HERE.\nIn order to resolve these questions, Foreign Minister Terajima Munenori (\u5bfa\u5cf6\u5b97\u5247) finally ordered an on-site survey of Ulleungdo in 1880 (\u660e\u6cbb\u5341\u4e09\u5e74) and dispatched the warship Amagi to the Ulleungdo area to clear up the name confusion concerning the islands in the region. The Amagi discovered that \"Matsushima\" (\u677e\u5cf6) was actually Ulleungdo and \"Takeshima\" (\u7af9\u5cf6) was a small island off the northern shore of Ulleungdo, which Koreans pronounce as Jukdo (\u7af9\u5dbc). The map made during the survey confirms that Takeshima was Ulleungdo's neighboring island of Jukdo (\u7af9\u5cf6).\nKitazawa Masanari (\u5317\u6fa4\u6b63\u8aa0) wrote an account of this survey in the Takeshima Kosho (\u7af9\u5cf6\u8003\u8a3c - \"A Study of Takeshima\"). In his account, he concluded that Matsushima was Ulleungdo and confirmed that both Ulleungdo and the island he called Takeshima, which was Ulleungdo's neighboring island of Jukdo"

The app itself was not updated and we already tried evry possible combination of the username and the @-Sign encoding.\nNote that I had to replace all real data with dummy data (<USER>, <DOMAIN>, <IPADDRESS>, <SERVERNAME>).\nI also noticed the port change but using the non-proxied port did not make any difference.\nI am able to access CalDAV from Lightning but that one does encode the @ sign as %40; other clients might not encode it at all.\nThis looks odd and like 2Go did double-URL-encode the @-sign: %2540 But with all the encoding happening some info might have been lost; could you have a look at the file nginx.access.log and post the corresponding line from there?\nHowever, CalDav in general works. Some of our users use the native Calendar in Apple iOS which works great.\nThis looks like a bug in the 2Do app. Notice the string \"<USER>%2540<DOMAIN>\". That %25 is an URL-encoded percent sign. So 2Do is requesting the calendar for the user \"<USER>%40<DOMAIN>\". What it probably wanted to request is the URL \"<USER>%40<DOMAIN>\" which would be, after URL-decoding \"<USER>@<DOMAIN>\".\nAll other CalDAV applications work since they either request the calendar as \"<USER>%40<DOMAIN>\" or plain \"<USER>@<DOMAIN>\". You should find some requests with their user agent in your log.\nIt is possible that Zimbra was a bit more lenient in previous versions and accidently did the right thing here. Or that Zimbra changed the way it returns the principal URL. There is a bug report about what Zimbra returns here from the DAVdroid author where (at least to my understanding) all involved parties agreed that Zimbra's behaviour is (was) fine. Ah, I found it, it is Bug 84857.\nI'd get in touch with the 2Do app authors. It is still possible of course that this is a Zimbra issue but right now everything points in their direction.\nI already submitted a support request at 2Do and they are investigating at the moment.<|endoftext|>We are but simple creatures on this old and misty isle.

Epub 2020 Sep 23.\nDepartment of Biology Education, Chonnam National University, Gwangju 61186, Korea.\nJeju Island is located at a marginal edge of the distributional range of East Asian evergreen broad-leaved forests. The low genetic diversity of such edge populations is predicted to have resulted from genetic drift and reduced gene flow when compared to core populations. To test this hypothesis, we examined the levels of genetic diversity of marginal-edge populations of, restricted to a few habitats on Jeju Island, and compared them with the southern Kyushu populations. We also evaluated their evolutionary potential and conservation value. The genetic diversity and structure were analyzed using 40 polymorphic microsatellite markers developed in this study. Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM) has been employed to develop our insights, which can be inferred from historical distribution changes. Contrary to our expectations, we detected a similar level of genetic diversity in the Jeju populations, comparable to that of the southern Kyushu populations, which have been regarded as long-term glacial refugia with a high genetic variability of East Asian evergreen trees. We found no signatures of recent bottlenecks in the Jeju populations. The results of STRUCTURE, neighbor-joining phylogeny, and Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) with a significant barrier clearly demonstrated that the Jeju and Kyushu regions are genetically distinct. However, ENM showed that the probability value for the distribution of the trees on Jeju Island during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) converge was zero. In consideration of these results, we hypothesize that independent massive postglacial colonization from a separate large genetic source, other than Kyushu, could have led to the current genetic diversity of Jeju Island. Therefore, we suggest that the Jeju populations deserve to be separately managed and designated as a level of management unit (MU). These findings improve our understanding of the paleovegetation of East Asian evergreen forests, and the microevolution of oaks.\nAn unexpected genetic diversity pattern and a complex demographic history of a rare medicinal herb, Chinese asparagus (Asparagus cochinchinensis) in Korea.\nDepartment of Life Sciences, Hallym University, Chuncheon, 24252, South Korea.\nRange-wide population studies of wide spread species are often associated with complex diversity patterns resulting from genetically divergent evolutionary significant units (ESUs). The compound evolutionary history creating such a pattern of diversity can be inferred through molecular analyses. Asparagus cochinchinensis, a medicinally important perennial herb, is in decline due to overharvesting in Korea. Eight A. cochinchinensis populations in Korea and three populations from neighboring countries (China, Japan and Taiwan) were examined using nine nuclear microsatellite loci and three chloroplast microsatellite loci to characterize molecular diversity patterns. The average within-population diversity was limited likely due to long-term bottlenecks observed in all eight populations. High pairwise F values indicated that the populations have largely diverged, but the divergences were not correlated with geographic distances. Clustering analyses revealed a highly complex spatial structure pattern associated with two ESUs. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) suggests that the two ESUs split about 21,000 BP were independently introduced to Korea approximately 1,800 years ago, and admixed in secondary contact zones. The two ESUs found in our study may have different habitat preferences and growth conditions, implying that the two genetically divergent groups should be considered not only for conservation and management but also for breeding programs in agricultural areas.\nDevelopment and characterization of 30 microsatellite loci for (Berberidaceae).\nAppl Plant Sci 2018 Dec 4;6(12):e01200.

In this study, 30 microsatellite loci, including 25 polymorphic loci, were developed for for use in population-level genetic analyses.\nMethods And Results: We carried out transcriptome sequencing and isolated a total of 30 expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeat markers from using Illumina HiSeq high-throughput sequencing. To test utility of the developed markers, we genotyped 60 individuals from three populations and estimated the number of alleles and levels of observed and expected heterozygosity. Expected heterozygosity levels ranged from 0.000 to 0.594, 0.000 to 1.000, and 0.000 to 0.744 in the three populations, respectively.\nConclusions: These transcriptome-derived simple sequence repeat markers are highly polymorphic and can be widely used in characterization of the endangered.

Mr. Watanabe was researching the location of Dagelet Island, which was the Western name for Korea's Ulleungdo Island, and he used this map as an example of Western maps that showed Dagelet Island at the coordinates 37 degrees 25 minutes N. latitude and 130 degrees 56 minutes E. longitude.\nBritain's \"Royal Atlas\"\nMr. Watanabe wanted to confirm the location of Dagelet Island because he suspected the Japanese name \"Matsushima\" (\u677e\u5cf6) was being used together with \"Dagelet\" to refer to Korea's Ulleungdo Island.

This is something manufacturers should be proud of.\nHowever, compared to last year, we can doubtless see that the trend is heading in the wrong direction and the great performance of 2017 has not been replicated in 2018.\nAfter the positive pick-up reported in the third quarter of the year, output balances have gone down to 22%. The result is still positive and over the trend of the last six years, however, it is heading down from the heights reached in the second half of 2017.\nLooking at the numbers, some concerns are linked to the divergence between output balance and total orders. The gap between the two indicators is the largest seen since 2015 and it might hint that part of production is more related to stockpiling rather than actual demand.\nIn the last year and a half, we highlighted several times how export was the big factor behind manufacturing expansion and although the balance in q4 remains in positive territory, it is a worrying sign to see such a sharp contraction from 24% to 12%.\nSlowdown of the global economy, in particular of the EU market which remains the largest UK destination by far.\nThe \u201cexhaustion\u201d of the sterling devaluation effect. The competitiveness gain obtained after the EU-referendum currency plunge has almost completely faded away.\nConcerns about Brexit and related disruption to trade. The risk of delays or goods stuck in UK and EU ports are pushing international partners to hold-off some of their orders. This seems to be confirmed by the expected pick-up in export orders in the next three months when, hopefully, we will have more clarity around the future trade landscape.\nHowever, on a positive note, only 18% of the respondents were not able to identify any notable pick-up in demand from any foreign market.\nNot surprisingly considering the slowdown in orders, the expansion of the previous quarters, and the increase in q3, employment balances are also down. Here as well, the balance remains positive, however the 12% recorded is the lowest level in the last two years.\nInvestment intention in the next 12 months is a similar story, with a tiny positive balance of 7% after the surprisingly high level registered in q3.\nThe gap between employment and investment intentions remain an interesting story. Since the aftermath of the EU-referendum, companies have shifted their preferences to employment and this is confirmed both by official data, which continues to see a very strong labour market and contracting business investment, and also by our latest Investment Monitor which highlighted how uncertainty has pushed companies to hire more and invest less to keep a high degree of flexibility.\nIf this is good news for someone looking for a job, or a pay rise, it\u2019s not great for productivity which is the key for long-term prosperity.\nOn Thursday, we will talk about sector forecasting and our thoughts on manufacturing sub-sectors.<|endoftext|>Author and social activist Mab Segrest has spent 30 years fighting against racism and homophobia. Her book 'Memoir of a Race Traitor: Fighting Racism in the American South' became the seminal book on white antiracism and still remains relevant today.\n But social activism was an unlikely career path for a woman whose grandfather was a klansman and whose parents who fought to keep schools segregated.\nShe first published her autobiography 25 years ago, but its re-release this year is prescient as the nation sees a rise in hate crimes. The book \u201cMemoir of a Race Traitor: Fighting Racism in the American South\u201d (The New Press/2019) is considered a classic text on white anti-racism. A graduate of Duke University, Segrest recently returned to North Carolina to find that her social activism is still needed.\nSegrest joins host Frank Stasio to discuss the role race plays in the current political climate. She gives a history lesson in hate and how she was branded a race traitor. Segrest will speak at The Forest at Duke on Saturday, Oct. 19 at 7 p.m. and join other North Carolina activists in conversation on Thursday, Oct 24 at the Rubenstein Library on Duke\u2019s campus.\nDuring my lifetime there [it] had the largest percentage of black people of any county in the United States \u2026 By \u201854, \u201855, the Civil Rights Movement had erupted.

But they were coming to pray on the steps when the doors were locked. My father was one of the door lockers... I know my bible verses, and I know it says: Knock and it will be open to you... Not so long later white men beat up those demonstrators with baseball bats.

I\u2019ll be a three-day-reporter of 2016 Dokdo camp to give you glimpse of this camp:) This year camp was the luckiest camp ever, and you\u2019ll know why in a moment. Also, there are some bits of interviews added so as to hear real story from the members.\nYJ: So, What made you here to spend the last days of your summer vacation? Also, before you tell us more about this camp, would you please introduce yourself?\nS: I\u2019m Seo-won Byun and I\u2019m a student studying at Philippines. As I have more foreign friends than Korean friends, I could easily realize how foreigners have some wrong information regarding Korea. So, I was searching how to explain such wrong information in a right way and rectify them. That\u2019s how I reached VANK and this camp. As Dokdo and East Sea are the most representative errors regarding Korea, I wanted to learn more on this matter.\nD: Last not but not least, I\u2019m Dogyun Kim from Gimcheon! Currently, I\u2019m on the way to set up a VANK club at my school. Initially, this club started out as \u2018Comfort Women\u2019 club but we extended to other issues such as Dokdo and East Sea. And, while we were researching on these issues, we met VANK and decided to change this club into VANK club. With my club members, we participate in one-day lecture to learn more about VANK and the issues. During the lecture, I was moved and motivated to accomplish all the tasks from the lecture, and I was chosen as the camp member!\nAfter we landed on Ulleungdo, we went straight to Dokdo museum and Sigaji observatory. This camp started off with learning more about Dokdo and experience whole view of Ulleungdo. It was much meaningful as the first spot was implicitly intended for members to address Dokdo with objective approach, rather than emotional appeal.\nAt last, back at seminar room, we finally had time to introduce ourselves to others. Before we move into an actual team activity, we had two valuable lectures to help our members to understand more on the topic we are addressing. First lecture was truthfully motivated to bring out each member\u2019s passion to act toward wrong information. Gitae Park, head of VANK, has strongly urged members to make actual action toward the issue, rather end up being mad and complain to others. Although there are limits, there are always ways to confront this issue and take action as a student.\nNext lecture was informative lecture from Sori Lee to give utmost important information regarding Dokdo. She especially pointed out that we should not be cynical toward Japan, but to understand them. Furthermore, we should learn our situation and the perspective of the world, and thus deliver our history wisely.\nThen, the first team activity started out with exciting music and the performance that was created by each team member. It was only after few hours since team members met each other, but they tried their best to become a one team and deliver their thoughts on Dokdo. Just wait for a moment to hear more stories about the team activity.\nThe weather was perfect for our trip to Dokdo, two and a half hours away from Ulleungdo by ship. The wave was so still that we were not even supposed to take a medicine for seasickness. This is why this camp was so lucky! Thanks to the weather, we were able to spend about an hour at Dokdo, which rarely happens. We went to the eastern island of Dokdo where police guard of Dokdo stays. And, back again with our three wonderful interviewees to tell us more about our exploration!\nYJ: The climax of this camp, exploring Dokdo! How was it to actually visit and step on Dokdo? You guys might have felt something that is hard to put into words!\nSeo-won: To be honest, at first, I didn\u2019t have much expectation. I just thought that it won\u2019t be that different from the photo of Dokdo. However, I realized at a second as soon as I landed that photo cannot express beautiful scenery of Dokdo. It was much more beautiful compare to any other photos taken by photographers. I thought to myself that I need to protect Dokdo not because we have to. But, because we need to protect the beautiful view along with valuable ecosystem within the island.\nTaegeon: Visiting Dokdo made one of my dreams come true! It was my life dream to visit and explore Dokdo as my future dream is to protect the island. First, I wanted to become police guard to protect Dokdo physically. However, I wanted to protect Dokdo in other perspective such as becoming international lawyer and act towards it. Dokdo is a true motivation and crux of my dream.\nReporter YJ: Then, let\u2019s hear from other members who are also thrilled to tell us more! Let\u2019s invite our lovely friend, Juyeon:) So, Juyeon, how was the Dokdo trip?\nJuyeon: Hello, I\u2019m Juyeon and I just stopped by because I wanted to share my thoughts, too! Well, Dokdo would be the most memorable trip ever in my life. Some people would be questioned on why it is meaningful to visit Dokdo. I think this leads to same question why we go traveling. People these days enjoy traveling around the world, visit new places and experience new culture and unique life style. And these trips become bits and pieces of our memories that stay in our mind for a life time. It\u2019s same with Dokdo! As we traveled to Dokdo with our friends who share similar hopes and dreams, this also becomes haunting experience that could never be forgotten. The reason we act on Dokdo became our own efforts to protect our precious memories with our friends, not because we need to protect our territory. Trip to Dokdo has built unforgettable memory to all of us!\nAfter putting aside the sadness of leaving Dokdo, back at Ulleungdo, We had the second team activity. For team activity, each team had to discuss on specific ways of responding to major media, which is the primary source of spreading wrong information around the world. Such media includes CIA World Fact Book, Lonely Planet, Google Map, Microsoft Bing Map, and etc. All of teams were having common basis that they all have credibility on such media and this is the very reason why they should rectify the mislead information. So as to give credible information to all the readers around the world, media should not provide information that was intended to promote imperialism.\nAs the last day of the camp, we gathered in seminar room for wrapping up our camp by each of us sharing personal comments on the camp. And then, we went to last trip around the Ulleungdo that extended our haunting memory from Dokdo. As it is our last part of trip, let\u2019s get back to interview to hear the overall comment of this memorable camp!\nReporter YJ: So, our long but short journey to Dokdo & Ulleungdo has come to an end! It would be a bittersweet moment for all of us. Still, I would like to hear overall comment! There must be a lot of things that you learned and thought to yourselves.\nDogyun: Well, before I came to the camp, I was both excited and worried as I get to spend three days with people I first met. But, as soon as I arrive and meet my team mates, all my worries were gone and spend the days with excitements. Also, this camp would be a great help for me to set up VANK club in my school. Now, I understand VANK vision and right response toward Dokdo and East sea issue as in student level. With my club members, I would actively take action and pile up small changes to bring bigger changes. Personally, I have come up with approach to myself, as well. To myself, as my dream is to become researcher of biotechnology, I always dreamed of promoting peace in my own field of expertise. However, it seemed contradictory to be interested in global issues and disregard domestic issues. I would always try to be interested in both aspects along with building up my expertise. In short, this camp has become one of turning point for me in various ways!\nTaegeon: Personally, I thought I know many things about Dokdo. But, I realized that knowing is not enough, taking action is the most important part. The most memorable"

        "passage": " stretching from the Silla period, through Koryo, and into Joseon has attracted the interest of the academic community.\nFormer head of the Metropolitan Air Quality Management Office and \"Dokdo\" researcher, Seonu Yeong-jun (55), who has recently received a doctorate from Seonggyungwan University, published a book on the 8th entitled, \"Dokdo during the Koryo and Joseon Periods,\" which made public the result of his research on the names of Dokdo and its dominium.\nAccording to the book, the first documentary evidence that both Ulleungdo and Dokdo were Korean land was in the \"History of Koryo,\" when, in the 13th year of King Taejo (930 A.D.), \"Uleungdo\" (\u828b\u9675\u5cf6) appeared. Uleungdo was an abbreviation of \"The Two Islands of Usan/Muleung\" (\u4e8e\u5c71\u6b66\u9675\u4e8c\u5cf6), which was \"one name two island\" (\u4e8c\u5cf6\u4e00\u540d) name for the islands Usanguk (\u4e8e\u5c71\u570b - Ulleungdo) and Muleungdo (\u6b66\u9675\u5cf6).\nDuring the Silla period, the formal name of Ulleungdo and Dokdo was \"The Two Islands of Usan/Muleung,\" which was used together with its abbreviated name \"Uleungdo.\" Dr. Seonu claimed that he has confirmed that the name, \"The Two Islands of Usan/Muleung,\" was used formally in documents, but that \"Uleungdo\" was used in everyday life.\nBefore 512 A.D., the people who set up a country on Ulleungdo were cognizant of \"Dokdo\" and used it as an essential territory. At the time, the concept of \"the two islands were not far apart, so they could be seen on a clear day\" (\u4e8c\u5cf6\u76f8\u8ddd\u4e0d\u9060\u98a8\u65e5\u6df8\u660e\u537d\u53ef\u671b\u898b) was established.\nDr. Seonu said that in 512 A.D. Usanguk became a part of Silla, the name \"Muleungdo\" was formed, and then the written expression \"The two islands of Usan/Muleung are in the sea due east of the hyeon\" was established.\nWhile the name \"Uleungdo\" (\u4e8e\u9675\u5cf6) was used for Ulleungdo and Dokdo in Silla and Usanguk, the name \"Ulleungdo\" started to be used as a dialect in the east coast region of Gangwon. In 1018 A.D., Usanguk fell, and the Gangwondo dialect name also became the commonly used name during the Koryo period.\nDr. Seonu determined that the final name for Ulleungdo and Dokdo went from \"Muleungdo\" (\u6b66\u9675\u5cf6) to \"The Two Islands of Usan/Muleung in the Sea Due East of the Hyeon\" (\u4e8e\u5c71\u6b66\u9675\u4e8c\u5cf6\u5728\u7e23\u6b63\u6771\u6d77\u4e2d), to \"Uleungdo\" (\u4e8e\u9675\u5cf6), to Ulleungdo (\u851a\u9675\u5cf6), to Ulleungdo (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6).\nSince \"Ulleungdo\" (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6) was the very last name for Ulleungdo and Dokdo, it is assumed that when Kim Bu-sik was compiling the Samguksagi, he mistakenly wrote \"Muleungdo\" (\u851a\u9675\u5cf6) as \"Ulleungdo\" (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6).\nOn maps in the latter Joseon, Usando was shown as Ulleungdo's Jukdo (Daetseom), and it is believed that during the time of [King ] Jeongjo and [King] Kojong, the name \"Songjukdo\" [\u677e\u7af9\u5cf6] applied to Dokdo, which demonstrated management and intent.\nDr. Seonu said, \"When you look at the name transition of Dokdo, the possesion of Dokdo was already established during the time of Usanguk and continued unbroken through Silla, Koryo, and Joseon.\" He added, \"Based on international law, Dokdo was never Japanese territory, and Japan only failed in its attempt to make it its territory.\"\nDr. Seonu advocates, \"We need to use Dokdo's original name of \"Muleung\" as a basis and compose a 'Muleungdwon' [Muleungdo Garden?] using Dokdo and ecological technology. Then we have to occasionally promote a plan that uses 'a place of dreams and romance.'\"\nFrom \"Korea and Her Neighbors\" by Isabella Lucy Bird.\n1904 February 20th Japanese map of Korea and Manch...\n1736 ~ 1767 - Yeojido (\u8f3f\u5730\u5716) - Ulleung/Usan (\u9b31\u9675\u4e8e\u5c71\u5169\u5cf6...\n1794 June 3 - Han Chang-guk (\u97d3\u660c\u570b) Inspects Ulleung...\n1786 June 4 - Kim Chang-yun (\u91d1\u660c\u80e4) Inspects Ulleung...\n1863 - Description of Ulleungdo from Kim Jeong-ho'...\n1807 May 12 - Lee Tae-gun (\u674e\u6cf0\u6839) Inspects Ulleungdo...\n1827 May 19 - Ha Si-myeong (\u6cb3\u59cb\u660e) Inspects Ulleungd...\n1831 May 14 - Lee Gyeong-jeong (\u674e\u6176\u9f0e) Inspects Ulle...\n1905 January 28th: Cabinet Decision to Incorporat...\nMid 1700s - \"Paldo Yeojido\" (\u516b\u9053\u8f3f\u5730\u5716) - Ulleungdo Ma...\nKorean Scholar Says \"Usando\" Was Ulleungdo's \"Jukd...\nFrom \"Korea and Her Neighbors\" by Isabella Lucy Bi...\n1900 Oct 27 - Imperial Edict Makes Ulleungdo a Cou...\n1888 - 1895 - Map of Samcheok District & Ulleungdo...<|endoftext|>First and foremost is the striking exterior.

When exposed to sunshine, the human body creates serotonin which is effective in relaxing the brain and contributes to feelings of well-being and happiness. Phytoncides and their refreshing scents given off by plants stimulate the human central nervous system to relieve tension and stabilize the body and mind. Nature seems to be the most important thing for both physical and mental health.\nAs we enter into the winter months, the Korea Forest Service came up with six recommendations of recreational forests good for visiting in winter. The six destinations share one thing in common: they are where people can enjoy everything that both forests and romantic winter seas have to offer.\nDaegwallyeong Recreation Forest located in Gangneung, Gangwon-do (Gangwon Province) is the nation\u2019s first forest built for recreational purposes.  Some of the trees, grown from seeds artificially sown from 1922 to 1928, are of high academic value. The forest has a lot to offer for travelers: forest trails, botanical gardens, straw-thatched cottages in red clay, waterwheels and charcoal kilns. A pavilion overlooking the forest offers a wonderful panoramic view of Gyeongpodae Beach on the East Sea.\nGeombongsan Recreation Forest in Samcheok, Gangwon-do is one of the most popular sites for mountain biking enthusiasts. The magnificent ridgeline stretching out toward Yukbaeksan Mountain has posed a challenge for numerous mountain bikers. Standing on the peak of Geombongsan Mountain, you can get a beautiful view of the boundless open sea to the east and the tall Sageumsan Mountain (1,092 meters) to the west. On a clear day, you can see as far as Ulleungdo.\nHuirisan Pine Tree Recreation Forest located in Seocheon, Chungcheongnam-do (South Chungcheong Province) is surrounded by majestic pine trees maintaining its beautiful greenness all year round. An outstanding landscape begins to unfold from the entranceway in which a reservoir and pine trees meet in great harmony. The"

According to SheFinds, the franchise implemented an 8.1% surge in pricing in 2021 and at the onset of 2022, another 10.5% was tacked on to cover the increasing cost of food and more competitive wages.\nAs a result, several folks have come up with \u201ccreative\u201d ways to get more food for less (much to the ire of employees).\nThe brand\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Brian Niccol, expressed confidence in Chipotle\u2019s ability to maintain a strong customer base in spite of swelling item costs. \u201cI really believe the value proposition that we sell today is our strongest proposition. We looked really hard at this. When you look at a chicken burrito, steak burrito and you compare that to your alternatives, the value is there,\u201d he told SheFinds.\nDon\u2019t count TikToker Tyler Funke (@fylertunke) as one of these patrons. Like a fellow user on the platform @robertbuckmon, Funke was gobsmacked by the cost of a Chipotle burrito bowl and couldn\u2019t understand how two barbacoa burrito bowls and two medium drinks came out to $40, even though only one of the bowls had guacamole in them.\nIn the clip, Funke also implies that the chain\u2019s prices are dishonest, stating that with toppings and add-ons, the cost of the items seemingly doubled when it finally came time to pay at the register. Fast Food Menu prices currently list the cost of a Chipotle barbacoa burrito bowl as $7.50.\nViewers shared Funke\u2019s frustration, stating that they too feel they\u2019re paying way too much every time they visit the franchise. Others have stated that they\u2019ve given up visiting the chain because they claim it\u2019s becoming more and more expensive for the food that they\u2019re getting.\n\u201cChipotle used to be 6.50,\u201d one user wrote.\n\u201cNO FR ITS SO EXPENSIVE FOR NO REASON!\u201d another urged.\n\u201cThe new steak is 12.10,\u201d a third user claimed.\nSome stated that the franchise\u2019s affinity for miscellaneous fees is what ultimately results in higher item costs.\n\u201cNo they charge $16 for an extra scoop of corn and it infuriates me,\u201d one viewer complained.\n\u201ci went to a chipotle that was out of guac, lettuce, beans, cheese, and salsa\u2026.i just asked for queso on top and they said $3 A SCOOP \u2026YALL HAD NOTHING,\u201d a second shared.\n\u201cAnd let\u2019s not talk about how they purposely skimp when u DoorDash it\u2026 extra chicken was 13 pieces. 13,\u201d a third added.\nA Yahoo Finance article shared some tips on how to maximize the amount of food you\u2019re getting with your Chipotle order without getting charged more. The outlet claims asking for \u201chalf and half\u201d of rice and beans usually results in more of the toppings without an extra charge. Chili-corn salsa and fajita veggies can also be added in at no additional charge, the article advises.\nBut even with these hacks, it seems like there are a lot of Chipotle customers who are not happy with the prices the chain\u2019s been charging.\n\u201c$100 is the new $20,\u201d one viewer suggested.\n\u201cI never get drinks at restaurants anymore lol they add up so much,\u201d a further user wrote.\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like customer anger towards these prices is affecting the chain\u2019s bottom line, however, as Chipotle has reported significantly increased profitability in 2022.\nThe Daily Dot has reached out to Tyler via Instagram direct message and Chipotle via email for further comment.<|endoftext|>1. My name is Hong Jae-hyeon. I came to Ulleungdo from Gangneung, Gangwon-do Province 60 years ago and have lived here since. I am 85 years old.\n1. The residents of the island have known that Dokdo belongs to Ulleungdo all along since the human settlement on the latter island.\n1. I myself have made four or five visits to Dokdo over the past 45 years together with other villagers, Kim Yang-gon and Bae Su-geom, to collect sea mustard and catch sea lions.\n1. For my last visit to Dokdo, I borrowed a Japanese vessel and hired its owner Murakami and crewman Oogami. I hunted together with them.\n1. Dokdo can be clearly seen from Ulleungdo on fine days, and some of Ulleungdo\u2019s ships sailing the East Sea have drifted ashore on Dokdo. It is only natural for Ulleungdo residents to take a keen interest in Dokdo.\n1. I am aware that a group led by the Oki Islands magistrate from Japan visited Ulleungdo in the tenth year of Gwangmu, or 1906, and made the absurd claim that Dokdo was Japanese territory.\n1. I then heard that then County Magistrate Sim Heung-taek protested the unreasonable claim by the Oki Islands magistrate's party and reported this to the higher authorities after discussion with village head Jeon Jae-hang and other many community leaders in order to prevent any unjustified threat by the Japanese.\n1. I was fully aware that this was an important issue for Ulleungdo as I had social contact with Jeon and often visited the administration office.\n1. Then, when they heard about the claim of ownership over Dokdo by the Japanese party, the residents, fishermen in particular, became outraged.\n1. It was deplorable that, despite the report by the magistrate, as the overpowering of Korea by the Japanese forces was then in full swing, we did not hear any good news and Korea became annexed by Japan.<|endoftext|>Press Release \u2013 The Wyoming Highway Patrol recently commissioned four recruits to the rank of Trooper upon the completion of their intensive training academy.

Cold air but blue sky: wonderful conditions to play this beautiful undulating woodland course. I agree with a previous review that reversing the course order (1-9 becoming 10-18 and vice versa) would indeed be an excellent idea. The beauty of the course is revealed by the first nine holes. The last nine are more demanding from a golf perspective (except for hole n\u00b05 \u2013 stroke index 2, a real challenge requiring length, precision and finesse) but miss a bit the look.

The official doubts if this will be successful, because the charges against her are not very severe.\nAccording to the Ministry of Justice and the Immigration Department, there were 1,501,761 foreigners residing in Korea as of Sunday.\nAs of April, Chinese\u2014including ethnic Koreans from China\u2014accounted for 49.9% of Korea\u2019s foreign population. They were followed by Americans (9.3%); Vietnamese (8.1%); Japanese, Filipinos and Thais (3% each); Uzbeks (2.5%); Indonesians (2.3%) and Mongolians (1.8%).\nIn the comments to that post, some wondered just how many of these foreigners are ethnic Koreans. The answer to that question can be found in the most recent immigration report (from April), which can be found here.\nOut of 1,486,367 foreigners in Korea in April, 461,023 were Korean Chinese. If we subtract them from the largest dongpo (overseas Korean) visa categories, we're left with 3,600 on the F-4-1 visa, 61,000 on the F-4-2 visa, 7,700 on the F-4-11 visa, and 8,000 on the F-5-7 visa, or about 80,000 in total. Add that to the number of Korean Chinese and that makes for about 540,000 ethnic Koreans (though there are probably more on other visas), or more than one third of the total.\nOf the 80,000 ethnic Koreans who aren't Chinese, around 43,000 are Korean American (one third of the total 138,924 Americans; those connected to the US military make for another third), 13,000 are Korean Canadian (making for more than half of the 24,003 Canadians here) and 4,594 are Korean Russians.\nGlancing over at the E-2 stats, there are currently 20,965 E-2 visa holders here, which shows that numbers are continuing to decrease. It's quite a drop from the all-time high of 24,107 here in February 2011 (when incoming and outgoing public school teachers overlapped).\nOh, and just because we crossed the 1.5 threshold on Sunday doesn't mean that it will stay above that point. That figure includes tourists, and fluctuates depending on the time of year.\nHere are some stories about foreign teachers that have popped up over the past few weeks and months.\nLooking first at Chungcheongnam-do, on Monday the Joongdo Ilbo published an article titled \"Married native speaking teachers rescue woman who fell into water.\"\nOn June 2 at around 3pm the couple, who work at a middle school and high school in Daejeon, were walking in Maenyeon-dong in Seo-gu near the Expo bridge when they heard a strange sound and, running toward it, came upon a woman in her 30s who had fallen into the water. The husband and wife jumped in and together pulled her to safety and turned her over to 119.\nThe couple modestly said that it was just something they had to do, and that they didn't want their photos taken or names recorded.\nAs well, News 1 reported that native speaking teachers took part in a Korean cooking culture experience on May 25. Cultural experience programs for NSETs like this are often reported in the press.\nEnjoy it while it lasts, I suppose - back in March, the Daejeon City Journal reported that 760 Korean public school teachers were being trained by the Chungcheongnam-do office of education in order to replace native speaking teachers. Around the same time the Joongdo Ilbo reported that Hwadong Elementary school in Taean was having internet lessons every day for twenty minutes with Filipino native speakers in a program which helped 20 students from grades 3 to 6.\nIn less good news, the Chungcheong Ilbo reported that a 'foreign teacher' was booked without detention by police for stealing a cell phone worth a million won from a bar on May 17 in Cheongju's Sachang-dong. Since the words 'English' and 'native speaker' don't appear, I'd assume he wasn't an English teacher, but who knows?\nAs for the Busan area, Yonhap reported on May 27 that seven native speaking teachers as well as students at Busan International Middle and High School were organizing a fundraising drive for an orphanage in Kenya which one of the native speaking teachers worked at previously as a Peace Corps Volunteer.\nIn not-so-good news, Yonhap (and several other outlets) reported on May 24 that 54 year-old Mr. Shin was arrested for stalking a female American English teacher for two months. It started on April 1 when he saw the high school teacher in Busan's Bugok-dong, near where she lived, and began following her and speaking to her in English. He'd wait near where she lived when it was time to go to work and follow her, and even threatened to kill her if she contacted the police.\nIt would appear female foreign teachers haven't had the best luck in Busan. Yonhap also reported back in March that on March 9 a Canadian hagwon instructor was crossing the street near Haeundae Station when she was hit by a 125\u33c4 motorbike without a license plate and suffered a fracture to her femur. The 17 year-old driver fled but later felt guilty and turned himself in.\nAs for teachers from Gyeongsangbuk-do, several media outlets have reported that last weekend 16 native speaking teachers from Uljin went on a trip to Ulleungdo and Dokdo; this report even has a photo.\nThere are a few reports (such as this one about Gyeonggi-do and this one about Busan) about NSET cuts in public schools that I'll save for later.\nThe Joongang Daily took a lengthy look at the mess that is the Yongin EverLine last week. For more details on the project, have a look at Kojects, which has been covering it for some time.\nDaegu English teachers become honorary ambassadors...\nBits and pieces in the news about foreign teachers...\nA look at statistics related to foreigners in Kore...\nThe Joongang Daily took a lengthy look at the mess...<|endoftext|>SharkBite brass barb to female FNPT drop ear elbow.

Although the actual day of Chuseok is only celebrated on one day, school was out on Monday and Tuesday, which gave me an extended 4-day weekend.\nAlthough I\u2019ve been itching to travel outside of Korea, I decided to not venture off too far because of the short amount of time given. I signed up to join a travel group to Ulleung-do, an island east of Korea\u2019s mainland. I typically like to plan my own travel, but Korea often makes it difficult to book tickets and accommodations unless you are a native. For this reason, I opted to pay 295,000 KRW (~$295) for Seoul Hiking Group to provide bus travel, ferry tickets to and from, accommodation, a few small meals, and also lead us to the island\u2019s must see places.\nThe ferry boat.\nTo put a long story short, this trip was one of the most unorganized trips I have ever been on. First off, there was no \u201ctrip leader\u201d to help guide the group of 40 people who paid to go. More than half the time, people were confused about where to go and there was no one to get answers from. Luckily, the only guy who could speak Korean stepped up and volunteered to help lead the group.\nI knew nothing about Ulleung-do prior to coming on this trip, and I still know very little about it. But if I had to sum up the island in a few words based on observation, I\u2019d say they\u2019re big on pumpkin, squid, and rock formations that look like animals or human genitals. The salty water surrounding the island is a gorgeous blend of blues and greens.\nCan you see the turtle behind me?\nClimbed up on turtle rock.\nSquid racks, a common sight here!\nIn front of the Pumpkin Goodies factory!\nPumpkin makgeolli, rice wine.\nBuddhist temple stop during the bus tour!\nThe \u201cbeach\u201d @ sunset.\nKorean flags galore!\nLast day by the seaside!\nThe scenes are picturesque and yet somehow I found myself feeling unpleased. I kept comparing what I was seeing to what I have seen before in other places, and my appreciation for it was lacking. I knew I shouldn\u2019t compare, because each place has its own uniqueness that should be revered but I just couldn\u2019t seem to kick my salty attitude to the curb. Maybe it was a buildup of shitty sleep on rock hard floors, dingy bathrooms, annoyances with the travel group, and more notably the 20+ mosquito bites all over my face and body that had me scratching like a crack feign.\nI knew that the main reason for my misery on this trip was all in my head. I\u2019ve been dealing with bigger stresses and negative feelings that I have tried to suppress, and they often resurface at the most inconvenient of times. I tried my best to enjoy Ulleung-do, which required me to break away from the group at times to explore not only my physical surroundings, but also my own restless mind.\nI had to remind myself that sometimes the best kind of vacation involves doing absolutely nothing, rather than trying to do everything.\nWell, even though it wasn\u2019t the best trip ever\u2026I did enjoy some of the bomb Korean fried chicken! When all else fails, turn to fried food!\nThe BEST boneless chicken I\u2019ve ever had! Gangjeong Chicken from BHC, Better & Healthier Chicken restaurant chain.\nCrispy, light fried boneless chicken strips with fries!\nBasket of fried goodness: KFC, Korean Fried Chicken.\nLast meal in Ulleung-do was Donkatsu, fried pork cutlet.\nThis entry was posted in #KimmyeatsKorea, EAT, Food, Korea, TRAVEL, Travels, WATCH and tagged Adventure, Korea, Koreancuisine, KoreanFood, Koreanfriedchicken, makgeolli, pumpkin, Sikhye, SouthKorea, Squid, Travel, travelblog, Travels, Ulleung, Ulleungdo, Vlog.

The liturgical book was designed in 1716 for the chapel of a wealthy Venetian family, the thread's silver colour now a dull grey and the pink ribbon markers have yellowed. The book is a rare example of an embroidered binding and yet its significance was never recorded in the library's catalogue \u2013 to the world it had ceased to exist.\nThe book's binding was discovered on Monday, the first day of the library's inventory \u2013 the first in 40 years \u2013 which aims to go through many of the library's 800,000 books in two weeks. Home to the rarest books in the country, the library is closed for this period, and librarians and archivists are gently, one by one, removing books and manuscripts off the shelves, organizing and looking for items that may have been misplaced, lost or stolen.\n\"As long as humans are doing their jobs, error is going to creep in, even if your staff is 99 per cent accurate all the time, there is still that 1 per cent and over 40 years things can go astray,\" said Pearce Carefoote"

        "passage": " from school, but it reads like that today if you look at the basic Chinese textbook. We've got two happy kids learning from a teacher, and they're learning to uphold party line.\nOn the one hand, that's totally anachronistic, and yet I as a teacher don't know what the kid is going to take away from that. Is the kid going to take away the story line, or is the student going to memorize the verb form?\nDEVIN STEWART: Every friend that I have who has studied Chinese language has been taught to recite communist doctrine as part of the language class. Is that pretty typical?\nALEXIS DUDDEN: I don't think it's abnormal. That's the rub right here. I think that doesn't necessarily make someone a communist, and I think of our so-called \"China hands\" in the State Department, many of whom were not even allowed to study in China until 1972; Taiwan was where you went for the language for so long. But it doesn't make you a communist to learn the language.\nThe thing that is causing concern is the way that these institutes insist on picking their own instructors and insist on having the students memorize language policies that are not necessarily open speech. I think of my best Japanese language instructor in Tokyo in 1991 at Keio University who looked at the textbook and said: \"Oh, this is completely not how Japanese people speak. This is not how we read,\" and he threw the textbook away. This was on a Ministry of Education fellowship at one of the best universities in the world, and he was fine. Nobody censured him. It was no problem. We all did great on the Japanese foreign language exam.\nThat's not allowed in the obverse, in the Confucius Institutes, and that's where the issue of freedom of academic expression and freedom of inquiry is at stake.\nIs China alone in that? At the moment, maybe.\nALEXIS DUDDEN: I'm just thinking this in the way that you've asked the question, in terms of South Korea, Japan, and the United States. There have been times in the last four decades that, say, the United States would have had similar influence on picking certain professors, the South Korean government certainly in the 1990s had similar influence.\nDEVIN STEWART: That's what happened with 38 North, right?\nALEXIS DUDDEN: That one's a little murkier in terms of right now.\nDEVIN STEWART: The Korea center at SAIS, the government wanted to select who the fellows were.\nALEXIS DUDDEN: Right. That works against the image of any society as an open society. So if a government is going to issue cash to an American university or a Japanese or\u2014work in circles here\u2014any of these places, then they should be willing to allow that university's faculty engagement with the institute because that is the point of an open-learning system.\nSpin it to something else like the Chinese government's commitment to new broadcasting techniques to rival CNN, to rival NHK World-Japan, then it's easier to say, \"Okay, you're spinning doctrinaire policy.\" That's up to the viewer to be able to figure out and parse.\nAgain, it's easy to target the Confucius Institutes. I guess while they remain at the level of language instruction, I think that's one thing. If the Chinese government starts saying to Columbia University or to Yale, \"You can't hire that person in political science or history because that's not the history of China because we've always had Taiwan,\" things like that would obviously be more overt interference.\nDEVIN STEWART: Talk to me a little bit about the history claims that the Chinese or Japanese want to put out there.\nALEXIS DUDDEN: Right now we have the example in which the Chinese government wants to ban international airline carriers from going to Beijing if they don't change their maps to read \"Taiwan, China.\" So far really only U.S. carriers are pushing back. Lufthansa has gone with the Chinese government. I was just flying on All Nippon Airways (ANA). This is a huge market. Are airline carriers going to say that Taiwan is its own country, or are they going to go with that market that they need for business?\nThere was a Japanese clothing company called Uniqlo\u2014I think there are several branches in the city\u2014that had a map of the world, and Hong Kong was not listed \"Hong Kong, China.\" The Chinese government protested, and the company changed the T-shirt\u2014if it's a T-shirt, it's a bag, it's a map\u2014on a piece of clothing.\nBut the Chinese government has just recently ratcheted up to include Taiwan and is testing first interestingly not in a university setting, not in a government setting, but something that they know needs business in China, which is airlines. Most airlines have actually succumbed to the demand because the market is more important than some notion of history. But that's how China is testing its ability\u2014at least as I see it\u2014to push this authoritarian approach to rule and society.\nIt's a tricky moment insofar as around the world liberal democracies are, if not in crisis, certainly having enormous moments of self-reflection and pressure. If there are movements within the great societies of the West to tighten control, to shut down, and to say egregious things that are now being supported from on high in the United States, England, and France, then why wouldn't the Chinese government pounce right now?\nAt the moment, yes, it's easy to see what the Chinese government is trying to do to shape ideas, but it's really up to the liberal order to stand up to that and withstand it by saying: \"No. We don't teach this way. If you would like to put a language institute in our university, we'll pick the textbook.\"\nDEVIN STEWART: You mentioned before the podcast that a similar eruption happened over a mango mousse. Can you tell that story?\nALEXIS DUDDEN: I think about these complaints, which on the one hand seem frivolous. Example, Taiwan on a map: Does it really affect your life as a Taiwanese person?\nDEVIN STEWART: Or does it affect the average passenger? Are they going to be brainwashed from now on?\nALEXIS DUDDEN: Especially if you got a really cheap ticket and you want to go to China for the weekend from X, Y, or Z. If you want to fly from Sydney, you're going to get the cheap ticket, so why shouldn't Qantas change? Who cares, in the one way of thinking.\nDEVIN STEWART: The blue one, right?\nALEXIS DUDDEN: The blue one, but it has both islands. It has Ulleungdo and Dokdo, the latter of which the Japanese refer to as Takeshima. Instead of just taking a pause and saying, \"Isn't it good that the Koreas are talking?\" the Japanese government lodged a formal complaint against the South Korean government saying that that was not their territory, that was Japan. It's a mango mousse with a frosting on it.\nThese are games at the top level that may be amusing to the people in charge, but they really do breed this kind of nationalist performance. I guess that's where I'm hesitant to condemn the Chinese government for language institutes if they can pull back, because that's a performative moment. Let as many people in the world learn Chinese as possible with Chinese government money, but don't tell them how they have to speak.\nAt the same time, yes, we should pay attention to things like the infiltration of the United States patent market. Things that are actually going to change societies are based in economics, and that is not just Marxian economics, that's the real world, and that is where China is making enormous gains, and it has nothing to do with language institutes.\nDEVIN STEWART: Your example about the Japanese officials getting wound up about the dessert and probably ended up being self-defeating in doing so reminds me of Jeffrey Kingston, who has written extensively about how he sees Japanese attempts to influence global narratives as quite inept, that Japan has not been the best producer of effective propaganda. I'm wondering, could you try to give us a sense of what are these countries trying to achieve with these campaigns, and who is the best at it do you think?\nAgain, the Fulbright program is not a Marshall program, it's not a pernicious program, but it brought an awful lot of important Japanese future leaders to the United States in the 1950s and 1960s including the future governor of Okinawa, \u014cta-san, who went to Cornell and didn't learn to be anti-American, but he learned to stand up as a liberal democrat for the people of Okinawa and lead the anti-U.S. base movement. Is that a bad result, or is that the most successful example of nation-building out there?\nIf we're really true to this whole 70 years of nation-building program, which has brought more wealth to more people than in any time in world history, then we have to say: \"Okay, we are going to be passing the baton at some point during the 21st century to China in terms of economic leader,\" and the trick will be to make it in China's interest to be the leader in an open way.\nI think Howard French's book China's Second Continent: How a Million Migrants Are Building a New Empire in Africa is absolutely important for everybody to read because this is maybe the future of the 21st"

        "passage": " share with the community. The videos Blaine personally enjoyed the most to make are interviews (like the nice interviews with the creators of Akira or Zorin OS), comparison videos, nerdy stuff videos, and the best of type of videos.\nWendell, formerly known from the Tek Syndicate, but now the face of Level1Linux, is a man with an enormous amount of in-depth Linux knowledge. If you are at the point that you are comfortable using your Linux distro, you may want to go to the next step and get some deeper technological knowledge. In that case you should definitely visit Level1Linux. According to Wendell they cover on their channel \u201cmore in-depth videos for mostly basic and intermediate level projects with open source operating systems based around (but not limited to) Linux and FreeBSD\u201d.\nEven though on my website RealLinuxUser.com I focus mainly on the productive use of linux and related software and much less on the technology, because I think that\u2019s the way to warm up potentially interested people to make the move to linux, from a personal point of view I also love to read or hear about the nerdy stuff as well and like to grow my knowledge on the underlying technology. If you are interested in this stuff as well, you will definitely find this depth and authority on the Level1Linux channel. Level1Linux is all about Linux gaming, modding, graphics adapters, processors, networking, and servers.\nOne of my passions is photography. For a while I worked as a wedding and portrait photographer in addition to my regular job as a solution designer, but my real passion is in landscape photography (www.johnbeen.nl). That is why I am very interested in photography related workflows based on Linux and open source software. So I am always looking for other people who also try to base their photography workflow on open source solutions. One of those people is Shane Milton. Shane Milton is a professional wedding and portrait photographer who uses Linux as his main daily driver to run his photography business and to do all of his photo and video editing.\nShane has already built up a lot of experience with this workflow and likes to share this via his YouTube channel with others who share his passion for both photography and Linux. Shane is a relaxed storyteller who talks relatively little about Linux distributions and related issues, but focuses primarily on the pure application areas around photography. That makes his channel also interesting for people who are not specifically focused on Linux, but who are interested in for example applications such as darktable and Rawtherapee, but also in photo editing and data storage. So his channel is about photography workflow, color management, storage, darktable, Rawtherapee, Gimp, Kdenlive, Blender, Natron, Rapid Photo Downloader, etc.\nHis tutorials are always divided over multiple videos, where he uses each video to highlight a specific focus area of an application and how to use it. When you follow these tutorials you will be taken by the hand by the applications and you will know enough at the end of the tutorial to start a creative project yourself, such as video editing, photo editing, animation and drawing. I think what he is doing is really amazing and deserves some attention from you all.\nAbove I have mentioned and described five vloggers. Of course there are many more YouTube channels where quality content is available, so this list could have been much longer. But my intention was to share some really different types of vloggers, to show what diversity is available on the topic of Linux and open source. As I have stated before, I think the above channels deserve a visit from you. Your knowledge will be enriched by it.<|endoftext|>Ousan, Considered Usando on Western Maps are not Liancourt Rocks, but It is Jukdo.\nSome Korean so-called professor, scolor claimed that Ousan is Lianocurt Rocks.

A company or battalion-sized force of marines and Assault Amphibious Vehicles will be stationed on the island by 2018.\nIt is the first time the Korean military has mentioned any definite timing for the deployment.\nAlthough the South Korean military claims it is seeking to protect the island from Pyongyang, Japan\u2019s Kyodo News reported the move could also be to deter military action by Tokyo.\nLocated 120km (74.5 miles) east of South Korea, the Liancourt Rocks \u2013 known as Dokdo in Korean and Takeshima in Japanese \u2013 lie in rich fishing grounds which are believed to contain large deposits of natural gas.\nThe new base could rile the US, which is a strategic ally to both South Korea and Japan, and is thus obligated under mutual defense treaties to defend both countries from attack.\nUS President Barack Obama has so far remained neutral in Seoul and Tokyo\u2019s disagreement over the gas-rich Liancourt Rocks.\nThe US, however, has already pledged support for Japan\u2019s claim over the Senkaku (Diaoyu) islands, which are contested by China, and may be forced to pick a side in the disagreement over the Liancourt Rocks if the dispute descends into a stand-off.\nSouth Korea has made clear it considers the islets to be national territory and therefore subject to its military treaty with the US.\n\u201cOur government\u2019s stance is that Dokdo is a territory under South Korea\u2019s administrative control as stipulated in the South Korea-US Mutual Defense Treaty,\u201d Foreign Ministry Spokesman Cho Tai-young told reporters in 2014.<|endoftext|>Lightweight warmth doesn't get any softer than this high-pile fleece jacket that's crafted with a tailored waist, a cozy oversized collar, and comfortable stretch cuffs and hem for a flattering fit.

In a culture increasingly on the move and offering a thousand different ways to get shrink-wrapped stories, reading novels can seem daunting. Some people only find the space in their schedules for entertainment; others are tempted to reject fiction in favor of \u201creal life\u201d (the news or the latest biography).\nSo, why read literature?\nSome of our most important lessons are conveyed not by Buzzfeed list or instruction manual, but through stories, metaphors and recurring symbols. To truly understand the weight of the Holocaust, we do not introduce statistics but instead ask young people to read Anne Frank\u2019s diary. This is certainly not that to avoid the facts but quite the contrary; some things are so blindingly true they can only be approached effectively through story.\nRather than getting swamped in overwhelming amounts of data, literature helps us to focus our vision. Literature helps the scales fall from our eyes.\nNot only does it help us to approach and cope with the indescribable \u2013 reading also teaches us humility and empathy. Literature demands that you truly listen to the author and perform the work of interpretation. Without camera angles or music cues, without retweets and reports, the novel demands from us our full attention, with no promise of perfect certainty. We must imagine and reflect, admit our confusion, and allow for our hopes.\nThis work, this patience and honesty, I would argue, is essential for our souls. We must engage in stories larger than our need for expertise or entertainment.\nLiterature forms in us a posture of receptivity and curiosity, an attitude which directly contradicts the world\u2019s clamor for opinion.\nBy teaching us how to listen, literature also teaches us how to converse with one another the way we ought \u2013 with compassion and humility rather than instant judgment.\nWhen we meet characters, we are able to see others with mercy in a way we would not if they remained merely issues and abstracts. The saint and the sinner become complicated in the web of story that teaches us to reflect on our complexities. Rather than feed us information, books raise questions, questions that will not simply send us racing to the next course of action or"

That stands for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. The Obama-era program allows many undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to remain here. Again, President Trump plans to end DACA in March unless Congress acts.\nEarlier I spoke with Congressman Pete Aguilar, a Democrat from California. He's one of the original cosponsors of a bipartisan DREAM Act which would put these protections into law. Welcome to the program.\nPETE AGUILAR: Thanks for having me, Ari.\nSHAPIRO: Democrats had promised not to support a government spending bill unless it includes DACA protections. Here's House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi earlier this month.\nNANCY PELOSI: I stand by that statement. We will not leave here without a DACA fix.\nSHAPIRO: And yet now a short-term funding measure will pass with Democratic votes without addressing DACA. Immigration activists say your party caved. The group United We Dream called this a vote to deport immigrant youth. How do you respond to that?\nAGUILAR: Well, we don't want a delay. We want to fix this issue. We want to do it as quickly as we can. The bottom line is this. Every day we delay, hundreds of people are at risk from the president's order. This is a crisis that the president created. It's up to Congress to fix it. And every day, 122 individuals lose out on their ability to continue through the DACA status. So it's our charge and responsibility in order to get this done.\nSHAPIRO: And yet this is the moment that Democrats had leverage to either force a shutdown or force a vote on DACA. And immigration activists say the Democrats blinked.\nAGUILAR: Well, I'll be voting no. And I encourage my colleagues to do the same. You know, we made a commitment that we would work to get this done. We will work to get this done each and every step of the way. There are going to be more deadlines and more opportunities in the future. Should this chance go by, I will represent my communities and be a strong no vote on the CR today because it doesn't solve this problem.\nSHAPIRO: The program officially expires on March 5, but thousands of people have already been losing their protection since President Trump announced in September that he was ending the program. What advice do you have for those young people?\nAGUILAR: Stay strong. Continue to work with us in order to get this done. We have their back. We will continue. As a member of the Hispanic Caucus, we have been out front in advocating for these young people to make sure that they have the protections to continue. But keep in mind, you know, what I've cosponsored with the DREAM Act you know, it includes those DACA individuals as well as those DACA-eligible individuals who never signed up because they didn't have the money or because they didn't want to give their information to the government.\nSo our responsibility is to fix this. We will continue each and every step of the way, each and every day to make progress, at times working with our Republican colleagues who agree with us on this issue in order to solve this.\nSHAPIRO: Republicans say that this will have to be part of a bigger package of immigration measures which will include stricter enforcement, perhaps including a border wall. How much increased immigration enforcement are you willing to swallow in order to get a deal?\nAGUILAR: Look; I think it's important to have conversations like you articulated with our Republican colleagues. We do not have a majority in the House of Representatives. Our responsibility is to try to count to a majority in order to get this done. Democrats haven't shied away from border security, and in fact we've passed some measures in the past. So you know, our responsibility is to make sure that some of these silly requests that the president and the administration have put forward don't move forward. But if there are reasonable places in order to meet Republicans, we're willing to do that.\nSHAPIRO: Do you consider a border wall silly?\nAGUILAR: You know, I think it's a waste of taxpayer resources in many ways to build a ocean-to-ocean border wall. Yeah, I do. So you know, there are opportunities. And if there are funding ways to repair and replace some pieces, you know, that's another conversation.\nSHAPIRO: How much of a price do you think Democrats will pay if this does not get done?\nAGUILAR: You know, we're going to get this done. I'm not going to, you know, deal in hypotheticals if this doesn't. You know, we want to get this done at the first available moment, whether that is today on the on the CR, whether that is in the next couple weeks when government hits a sequestration deadline as well as this CR could potentially expire. We will use every ounce of oxygen and leverage in order to make sure that we are advocating for our communities and making sure that we pass the DREAM Act.\nSHAPIRO: Congressman Pete Aguilar, Democrat of California, thanks for your time.\nAGUILAR: Thank you so much.

The Swans were ranked 2nd in the 2016 H&A season averaging 395.8 Disposals per game, they were ranked 1st with 40.4% of pure AFL Fantasy Midfield listed players scoring team total points.\nHannebery was a popular selection for fantasy coaches at the beginning of the 2016 season, despite regressing by 1.2pts and averaging 107.4pts for the season including Finals he proved his selection worth. Hannebery began last season well averaging 109.7pts between Rounds 1-11 (AFL Top 10 Rank), he remained consistent throughout the 2nd half of the season averaging 107.0pts between Rounds 12-23 & 102.3pts in the Finals. Hannebery scored 100pts or more at a 69.2% S/R (Strike Rate (AFL Top 10 Rank), he was able to convert those games in to scoring 120pts or more at a 30.8% S/R. Hannebery was consistent as they come across all player splits, he will again be a popular selection in 2017 and quite rightly so.\nKennedy again delivered a strong fantasy season especially in the back half of 2016, having averaged 101.3pts between Rounds 1-11 he finished the season off well averaging 114.5pts between Rounds 12-23 & 111.5pts in the Finals. Kennedy scored 100pts or more at a 64.0% S/R, he scored 120pts more at a 28.0% S/R which included a season high 156pts against Fremantle in Round 19. The debate will rage amongst fantasy coaches again this pre-season of who and how many to take from the Swans, selecting Kennedy at any stage throughout the 2017 will be a very sound move.\nParker averaged a career season high 107.1pts including Finals in 2016, his start to the season was explosive as he averaged 118.8pts in his opening 6 games. Frustration soon immersed fantasy coaches between Rounds 7-12 when he averaged just 85.5pts but that was short lived as finished the season off well averaging 119.2pts between Rounds 13-23. Parker scored 100pts or more at a 57.7% S/R (lowest out of Hannebery, Kennedy & Parker), he scored 120pts or at a 30.8% S/R which included a season high 158pts against the Bulldogs in Round 15. With Mitchell having moved clubs during the off-season the opportunity for Parker to take his game to the next level is quite possible, he does have a huge ceiling of points and hopefully can eliminate his poor scores in 2017.\nHaving played a full 26 games last season Lance Franklin couldn\u2019t quite get back to the 100.0pt average in 2016 (93.4 Ave), his only 100.0pt season average was back in 2012 with the Hawks. Since moving to the Swans at the beginning of 2014 Franklin has averaged 91.2pts, he has played in 86.7% of a possible 75 games again having played all games in 2016. Franklin scored 100pts or more at a 34.6% S/R last season, having got a start in quite a few games he only converted 11.5% of all games above 120pts. Franklin kicked 81 goals in 2016 at an average of 3.1 per game, often moving away from goal last season as part of the Swans game plan he recorded his highest Sydney Disposal average of 17.6. Whilst there is always the chance that Buddy can have another breakout season it is likely he will again average in the mid-low 90s, he is quite durable but his volatility in scores can be a negative.\nProbably one the most popular forward selections heading in to the 2017 season will be that of Isaac Heeney, after averaging 78.0pts last season including Finals the upside is looking more than bright for the upcoming 2017 season. Heeney averaged 101.0pts in the Finals which is a strong indicator of a good fantasy career ahead, he scored a career high 132pts in the Preliminary Final against Geelong. There is nothing to suggest that there will not be any growth from Heeney\u2019s opening price in 2017, just click away and enjoy the day.\nHeeney or Caddy for the forward line?\nThe full prices and positions for Greater Western Sydney and aflratings.com.au\u2019s top five potential...<|endoftext|>The Korean Peninsula is located in North-East Asia.

Tbh I feel kind of stupid, as I actually think in terms of value I should be above this woman. She's good looking, but I feel I have most other elements going for me. \n\n&gt;She's in the relationship still so while she's all about getting validation from other dudes, she is still observing other parts of the relationship. And while she has no problem pretending as if you're in the opening phases of the dating process because of the validation you give her, she has no intention (at least now) of following through.\n\nThat is very true. She's enjoying the attention. I mean, I maybe should view it in the way in that she thinks i'm someone worthy of dating if she wasn't prior engaged. I'm not sure if thats even the case in these situations. I mean I knew the gig and still went wit it. \n\n&gt;She's in a really pathetic state at the moment, from the sound of it.\n\nShe's a pretty girl with plenty of options, but yeah I don't agree with what shes doing.

Which is what I need to remind myself. \n\nIts kind of funny, I know better than to catch oneitis, but even knowing whats going on it's still sometimes hard to avoid.<|endoftext|>If a website requires you to scroll to load more data, you can build an interactive extractor with infinite scroll to extract from it.\nAn interactive extractor with infinite scroll allows you to record the steps required to scroll on a webpage, and the extractor will combine all screens to extract web data.\nCaution: Your account will be charged per page paginated using this method. For example, running a paginated extractor with 1 input with 10 pages and screenshots enabled should consume 11 queries (10 pages + 1 screenshot).\nTo add infinite scroll to your interactive extractor, simply click the Add Infinite Scroll button.\nOnce you've added pagination to your interactive extractor, record the interaction steps required to navigate to the next page. For the example below, we're extracting Tweets from https://twitter.com/google. We simply record ourselves scrolling to the bottom of the page to load more data.\nFor this example, we only want the most recent 6 pages of Tweets. By setting the screens variable to 5, the extractor will scroll to the bottom of the page 5 times and extract the from the entire webpage.\nTo modify what element is being scrolled to, you can modify the selector of the scroll action for the extractor to scroll to.\nOnce the pagination is done, you can train the extractor like you would normally. You can modify the number of screens to scroll by modifying the value in the settings for the extractor.<|endoftext|>Dokdo consists of two main islands, Dongdo (East Island) and Seodo (West Island), and 89 tiny rocks and reefs.

Negative antigens. Symptoms continued into Wednesday, negative antigen that morning and then a positive one at lunchtime. Positive antigen then on Thursday and Friday.

island.\nAverage rating 8 from 681 reviews.\nArriving early to the party allowed it to snag one of the best locations on Samet: a wide expanse of tree-lined land fronting a beautiful beach with views to Khao Laem Ya and the mainland.\nThe resort made the most of the property by building 21 detached wood-and-concrete villas under towering trees and padded by tropical foliage; roofs and decks were adjusted in places to preserve the trees. Beachfront and second-row villas come with wide furnished wood decks, while the cheaper \u201cgarden\u201d villas have smaller terraces facing inland towards rain collection pools and forest. All rooms come with firm beds on raised platforms, vaulted ceilings, rattan touches, Thai-style cushions and several windows. Bathrooms in the pricier villas feature outdoor rain showers with bamboo walls. Mod-cons like fridge, TV, WiFi and safe are also included. Though some show wear and tear, the rooms were refurbished a few years back and looked well kept when we last passed through in 2016.\nWith loungers, hammocks, a Thai massage pavilion, a swimming pool and bar placed directly over a beach that feels almost completely private, Mooban Talay has a very romantic atmosphere. Buffet breakfast is served in a large seaside restaurant, and the staff offer kayak rental and tour bookings. Given the setting, we feel that Mooban Talay offers better value than other mid- to upper-end resorts in Ao Noi Na, like Bar and Bed, Samed Club, Samed Cliff and Baan Ploy Sea, though any of these will also provide a comfortable stay.\nMooban Talaly does not advertise low-season rates but discounts can be expected in the rainy months. Expect rates to jump by 2,000 baht from mid December to mid January.\nCheck rates at Mooban Talay Resort on Booking.com.\nGarden villa. 4,500 for second row; 5,500 for beachfront.\nRoom: Superior double room, low season: 3,800 baht, high season 3,800 baht.

That is all the information the Japanese Foreign Ministry gives regarding the incorporation of Takeshima/Dokdo on their website. But why in 1905 did Japan feel a sudden sense of urgency to include these two islets?\nAt the time of the Shimane Prefecture Inclusion Japan was a nation at war, fighting for regional dominance in Northeast Asia.

It can be divided into three basins: the northern Japan Basin is the lowest region, the Yamatobecken located in the southeast and the Tsushimabecken in the southwest. In Yamatobecken the water is shallowest on. Where the base is located at approximately 285 meters below sea level. The coasts of the eastern islands are wide and relatively flat, however, are the mainland coasts, especially in the west along the coast of Korea, steep, rough and rocky.\nThe Sea of \u200b\u200bJapan, although even more colder than the Pacific on the other side of the islands is of great importance to the temperate climate in Japan. The fishing is an important economic factor for the littoral states; An inter alia the resulting conflict that affects the fishing areas, led to a dispute over the ownership of the Liancourt Rocks, which are claimed by Japan and South Korea and controlled since 1950 by South Korea.\nIn the Sea of \u200b\u200bJapan, there are also deposits of minerals that are mined, but especially the sea is a major shipping route.

In particular, students of international relations have associated democracy with a reluctance to wage wars against other democracies. This chapter examines the relationship between democracy and peace primarily in the context of the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict, but also in the Middle East more broadly defined. Clearly, the democratic peace hypothesis cannot explain the trend away from war in the early and mid-1990s in this democracy-deprived region. Furthermore, this trend was superseded by a return to convulsive violence in the Palestinian\u2013Israeli conflict by the end of the decade. Yet democratization as a process may have something to say about the prospects for stable peace. This chapter provides a profile of democratization throughout the region, highlighting the central dilemmas it faces and distilling some preliminary lessons from the 1990s regarding the impact of democratization on both furthering and inhibiting war and peace in the region. The region-wide political crisis triggered by the tragic terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 (9/11) brings into relief the importance of taking stock of earlier experiences with democratization and peace.\nPublication information: Book title: Democratization in the Middle East:Experiences, Struggles, Challenges.

        "passage": " is because most of them have died, and the generations born after the war came into power.\nOur presidents up to Kim Dae-jung all spoke Japanese fluently because they experienced the annexation. Park Chung-hee was anti-Japanese publicly, but in private he shared drinks with Japanese politicians speaking in Japanese. When the Japanese emperor Hirohito died in 1989, Kim Dae-jung went to the funeral and took a deep bow toward Hirohito\u2019s coffin. This would be unthinkable with our last three presidents.\nSo it will take some time, but when we have a president who were born in the 1980\u2019s or later, we will not be talking about our anti-Japanism.\nHopefully the anti japanism will die down plus the minjok myth that is causing ideological issues with North Korea.\nI feel this is seriously undermining Korea\u2019s geopolitical position. It\u2019s refusal to cooperate with Japan and align with it as well as other SouthEast Asian countries to counter China.\nOn the subject of Minjok and 5000 year history myth.\nHere\u2019s a lecture on the truths and myths of Korean history.\nHi. I\u2019ve just watched Prof. John Duncan\u2019s lecture on Korea, and found an error about his short comments on the Dokdo/Takeshima dispute (in the Q&A). In fact, the Korean king Kojong\u2019s 1900 decree referred to Ulleungdo, Jukdo, and Seokdo, and never Dokdo because the name Dokdo didn\u2019t even exist till later. This 1900 degree was about the Ulleungdo district, including the two tiny small islands nearby, but today\u2019s Koreans insist that this \u201cSeokdo\u201d meant Dokdo. Prof. Duncan says, \u201cKing Kojong told Japan not to fish near Dokdo,\u201d but in reality what the king said to Japan was not to go near Ulleungdo. \nAn interesting article in yesterday\u2019s Chosunilbo.\nLet me summary translate it in a few paragraphs.\n\u201cI am tired of reading daily articles on comfort women in the South Korean media. The group that hosts Wednesday protests in front of Japanese embassy, Chong Dae Hyup, is a leftist group with close ties to North Korea. The husband of its leader was arrested as a North Korean spy. Other members are also closely related to North Korea.\nThe South Korean public, who doesn\u2019t know the background of Chong Dae Hyup, is being deceived by its propaganda. Chong Dae Hyup\u2019s goal is to drive a wedge into U.S.-South Korea-Japan security partnership.\nI read a book by Professor Park Yuha of Sejong University, and she had a similar view on the comfort women issue as well.\nThanks. I see Wendy Sherman was right in what she was saying. The problem is the Korean establishment.\n\u201cI lot of readers didn\u2019t get the argument, and a lot rejected it. So I thought I\u2019d try again. Once again, when it comes to comments on this thorny issue, spare me the hate-mail and the racism.\u201d I\u2019m probably terrible at getting my points across, but here goes: I presume your \u201cpoint\u201d is the necessity of greater cooperation between Japan and South Korea. But posts like this and the earlier June 7th one, even when meant to criticize nationalism, actually just rehashes old nationalist grudges rather than focusing on other issues that are supposedly being neglected by Japan and SK. So of course it\u2019s extremely likely that a good deal of the responses you\u2019re going to get are \u201cdefensive\u201d Korean nationalists and maybe Japanese nationalists who want to chime in about \u201cYeah, see how Koreans can\u2019t be reasoned with?\u201d and not a lot of talk about J-SK cooperation. Acknowledge the issues between Japan and Korea (for what it\u2019s worth, I think Japanese imperialist apologia is overkill as a response to alleged Chinese/Korean intransigence on \u201cJapan bashing\u201d but anyway), but it might be better to focus on a \u201ccounter narrative\u201d that dwells on other specific issues that necessitate close J-SK relations.\nIs it not true that the S. Korean President\u2019s father was an officer in the Japanese Imperial Army?\nThat\u2019s why the Chinilpa label stings her more. It\u2019s also why she took the stance that she did with Japan and she went overboard with it.\nA slightly different approach to the war time experience by a Holocaust survivor, toward a former Auscwitz bookkeeper.\nIt is immediately obvious to anyone who has spent substantial time in the US that both its euramerican people and elites have an extraordinary, and negative, fixation with everyone else. USA\u2019s media talk about China and just about every other non \u2018white\u2019 country and people incessantly, usually with little journalistic objectivity and in negative terms, a recipient of the \u2018Western Wave\u2019 (watch for white analyses of the \u2018western Wave \u2018triumphantly arguing that \u2013insert here\u2013 housewives are learning English), a lurking military imperialist just waiting to subdue the \u2018western civilization\u2019. I could continue, but the point is that, as a social science observation, this obsession cries out for explanation, and it is hard to imagine that all this is just about democracy, law and order, first amendments, human rights, etc, etc. One obvious explanation for the sheer intensity of feeling is that white\u2019s disputes with everyone else have graduated from looting to identity. white people\u2019s nationalism is negative, based very much against everyone else. It is now widely accepted that white people\u2019s real ideology is not democracy, but a race-based ethnic nationalism in which they are defending the \u2018western\u2019 race against foreign depredation.\nby the way, south korea has not been culturally \u2018westernized\u2019 but modernized \u2013 which means modern global best practices and influences from everywhere, not just the \u2018west\u2019. and if you are implying americanization that has happened to a large degree, like it has everywhere around the globe including europe \u2013 do remember that usa is made up of western, eastern southern, northern, and every other civilization and people on this planet. it\u2019s not like south korea selectively took \u2018western\u2019 culture from america and left everything else behind. frankly, with the korean culture defines as it is by k-pop which is influenced by hip-hop and rap cultures specific to afro-americans and not westerns like you, one could argue that they are more everythingelse-ternized than westernized. and what would westernization mean anyway? do south koreans start wearing european traditional dress of skirts? and stop wearing central asian pants? do they stop reading books and stop wiping their asses with toilet paper and start using whatever \u2018western\u2019 culture did before it asianized?\nsouth korea has a minjok myth? and ofcourse you dont have an aryan myth right? hell even the term aryan is indian. who ofcourse \u2018received\u2019 their culture \u2013 from ancient europeans \u2013 as did egypt right? i get confused. should i call fox media and rupert to get confirmation. nope \u2013 i can just go down to the local library for an \u2018authoritative\u2019 historiography written by most euro-origin academics.\nwhat yardstick exactly does south korea have to measure itself against to display that its \u2018political\u2019 identity is democratic as opposed to race-nationalism? it certainly can\u2019t be european right? or any other political sub-national entity masquerading as an electorate in us or australia.\n\u201can elitist political opportunity structure have generated a robust street protest culture, a strong sign that elections are weak vessels of legitimacy\u201d \u2013 wow! were you describing south korea or the us, or just about any other country on earth?\nand how ridiculous that this article is being published in the website of an australian \u2018thinktank\u2019, a country that has a majority of european migrant imports who have installed a british queen as its official royalty, that has a tribal racial extremist past which has radicalised it\u2019s society and continues to rip-off native australians. not to mention the \u2018racial solidarity\u2019 that led it to host british nuke tests harming australia and the pacific and continue to contribute to current french nuclear weapons research. not to mention the recent political dog-whistles that buying japanese subs would \u2018bail-out\u2019 japanese companies that are \u2018struggling\u2019 apparently, as opposed to the thriving economies of mother-europe. with ethnic euro-american articles appearing touting faulty, sub-par german subs as \u2018stealthy\u2019, desperately trying to compete with japanese, and all of a sudden a few thousand jobs seems like a national issue to euro-australians.\nHi Robert, I know you don\u2019t care about the replies from Koreans.\nBut Korea is a free country that even allows you to write this kind of incomplete and personal insist that can even be leveraged by Japanese rightists.

This is something Riot has done with the Aatrox rework, but despite it increasing the overall playrate of Aatrox, it alienated the original playerbase that played Aatrox. Essentially, the original Aatrox mains stopped playing the champ while new people took over. Riot deemed this rework a failure despite the higher overall playrate and an important rework that has taught them to do reworks from that point onward differently.

        "passage": " you start the car with keyless entry, once you apply the foot brake, and change in to R or D (I have a CVT) the hand brake should release. This isn\u2019t happening sometimes and leaves the handbrake on, forcing you to apply your foot to the brake and then manually release the hand brake using the switch.\nYou need to have your seatbelt on for it to auto release, could this be your some time?\nSteve_m - thanks for the suggestion - that could well be it! I'll be more stringent with my seatbelt fastening habits and will see how it goes.\nAFAIK you don't have to wear a belt when reversing so if you're reversing out of a driveway does it recognise reverse gear and remove the parking brake?\nNo, you have to have seatbelt on for the car to automatically release the parking brake, otherwise you have to apply the foot brake to release the parking brake.\nWhen you stop and put the car in P, is it just putting the transmission in to a 'tension point' that prevents it from rolling forward or backward, or is it applying the handbrake, or what?\nP mechanically locks the transmission, it does not apply the electric parking brake.\nFirst world issues, having to release the handbrake manually........\nYou don't if you have your seat belt on.\nNever had any of this with the century old lever.\nAs I've posted before.....\nBack in Sep 2009 when I collected my then new torque converter auto from Ruislip Honda, amongst other things they forgot to do or check, they forgot to anchor the floor mats.\nAs I pulled out of the parking bay the floor mat slid forwards and covered the pedals. I was able to pull the handbrake and bring the car to a stop. I knew what to do.\nIf I'd have had a new vehicle with a new strategy of applying the parking brake I reckon it would have ended up in a collision to stop the car rather than drift into the main road. That is unless the new strategy incorporates a big red button marked emergency stop or similar.\nWith the old lever type there were problems with hot rollaway when the discs would cool and the car roll away, there were problems with the mechanical ratchet mechanism which ment the lever would drop and the car rolled away, this caused a couple of recalls on 8G, there is always the risk of other mechanical failure e.g cable snap/Calipers fail and there were also the 9G complaints about lever position and other layout issues.\nI'm sure my next car will likely be 'lever less' given the trend and job 1 will be to understand it before I drive off.\nHow to stop in traffic without constant brake lights dazzling matey behind will be on the training list as well.\nPut the handbrake on, silly. HB on, Brake Hold and Brake lights off. Simples.\nThat would have been ideal. But sadly no. Brake hold dazzles your fellow drivers by having the lights on. He meant that brake hold should be off, which thankfully is the default, and you pull the ebrake button same as you would a lever hand brake.\nExactly my point, it's all getting very complicated, brake hold, ebrake. I want to be considerate and not dazzle those behind.\nIt was all so easy. When parked leave it in gear or P depending on gearbox.\n\nEven if you have brake hold on, then pulling the HB sets the HB and switches off the rear brake lights. You then just 'drive away' as the HB releases as soon as you start going.\nIt's a button, one of many, you have to look for isn't it?\nI can set my 'handbrake' without having to look for it.<|endoftext|>BUNNELL \u2014 A Winter Park man was arrested Friday in the drugging and rape of a woman a year-and-a-half ago in the small Flagler County beachside town of Beverly Beach.\nFlagler County Judge Melissa Distler signed a warrant for the arrest of Larry Cavallaro, 72.

These 7 things that were captured on Street View in South Korea are sure to leave you with some unanswered questions.\nA young woman\u2019s chopped up body was found in an traveler\u2019s suitcase that was sitting in a wagon, untouched for over 3 years.\nPolice soon investigated the bag with a forensics team, but the case remains unsolved due to lack of evidence. It remains one of Korea\u2019s most controversial murder cases.\nCurrently, the wagon is blurred on Street View and cannot be seen.\nA photo of two men talking next to a truck became viral as one of the men had what appeared to be a knife behind his back, while the other man appeared to be covered in blood.\nFurther down the road, another man, topless and covered in blood, stood looking at the ground, with something in his hand.\nSome believe there must have been a feud between the three men, yet no other information about this ever came to light.\nA man was walking alone near Some Sevit Park in Seoul when he noticed the Street View car. He continued walking, until he disappears for a moment.\nFurther down the road, the man appears again doing a flag pole hold on a tree! He seized the extremely rare opportunity and gave the whole world a show.\nThe Street View team had to cross the ocean to visit Jukdo, a small island off the coast of Ulleungdo.\nThere they met the island\u2019s only guide dog, Maru, who followed them around everywhere and \u201cguided\u201d them around the island.\nA woman who appeared to be in her 50\u2019s or 60\u2019s was captured lying on the side of the road. The photo began spreading online and people were genuinely worried, so they reported it to the police thinking she was a murder victim.\nAs it turned out, the woman was an illegal immigrant from Mongolia, but she had become too drunk to go home and passed out on the side of the road.\nDue to the many police reports, her immigration status was discovered by authorities, and she was deported. Her sleeping body is currently blurred out on all maps.\nA small girl was spotted lying on a small set of steps and appeared to have been dead. In the photo, her arm is bent at an abnormal angle, and her ankle is blue with bruises.\nNo reports of murders, kidnappings, accidents, or deaths were made in that area, and so the girl\u2019s body remains a mystery today.\nChoi Soon Sil was former president Park Geun Hye\u2019s confidante. She abused her influence over the president to change government policies and extort money by manipulation. A woman whom people speculate to be Choi Soon Sil was spotted standing in front of a huge building in Gangnam that was owned by her.\nAlthough it\u2019s impossible to tell if it\u2019s really Choi Soon Sil or not, Korean netizens believe it\u2019s her because of the location, as well as her luxury brand bag.<|endoftext|>For the most part I think I can get the requirements.

The western islet is about 88,640 square meters in area; the eastern islet about 73,300 square meters.\nDokdo Island is composed mainly of two islets, 150 meters apart (Seodo and Dongdo in Korean, Nishi-jima and Higashi-jima in Japanese) both literally meaning western island and eastern island respectively). The western islet is the larger of the two islets. Altogether, there are about 90 islets and reefs, volcanic rocks formed in the Cenozoic era.\nIncredible Time Lapse Video of Dokdo!\n\ub3c5\ub3c4, A Time-lapse journey through DOKDO, KOREA from kwon, o chul on Vimeo.\nSouth Korea claims it as Korean territory from records that date back to the sixth century during the Unified Shilla period and on the 1900 Korean Empire ordinance officially incorporating three islands into modern Ulleung County. ( Korea\u2019s 1900 Incorporation of Dokdo Island ) Japanese claims come from seventeenth century records ( Dokdo \u2013 Takeshima and Japan\u2019s Historical Territorial Limits ), as well as a \u201cterra nullius\u201d incorporation in 1905. ( Japan\u2019s Military Annexation of Takeshima (Dokdo) in 1905 ) Today, South Korea classifies the islets as a part of Ulleung County, North Gyeongsan Province, while Japan classifies them as part of Okinoshima, in Oki District, Shimane Prefecture.\nThere is regular ferry service from Ulleungdo. There were 1,507 and 1,597 recorded tourists in 2003 and 2004 respectively. Due to their status as a nature reserve, special permits are required for tourists seeking to land on the islets rather than just circling them. In 2005, only 41,000 traveled to the islets with the number exceeding 100,000 in 2007. That year, the maximum of daily visitors to the islets was raised to 1,800, drawing more tourists to the area. As a result, Dokdo\u2019s number of tourists has risen dramatically.\nTo the right, an image of Korean vacationers on Dokdo\u2019s East Island with the watchtower and lighthouse in the background. According to Ulleung Island and the Dokdo Administration Office Sunday, 132,558 visitors came to Dokdo last year. The figure includes those who entered the islet or circled around it. The number is an increase of some 4,000 people from the previous year\u2019s 128,000. May had the largest number of visitors at 25,626 due to the clear weather, followed by 23,212 in August.

        "passage": " I had a terrible headache last night, and I still have one this morning. In fact, it hurt so bad that I could not sleep last night. Also, reading my comments from last night I can see a lot weird mistakes, so I guess I was pretty much out of it.\"\nI hope you'll get well soon. Anyway, I don't mind at all your pointng out my mistake, so if you think I'm wrong, you are all welcome to say so. I don't always agree with you, but I think it is OK. We can agree to disagree.\nAnyway, I think \"\u76f8\u671b\" definately suggests those two islands are close to each other, unless \"\u76f8\" was inserted by mistake like Sejong's geography text. And the sentece definately says \"\u5cf6\u5dbc\" exist to the east, not visible to the east.\nYou see \"\u897f\u671b\"\"\u6771\u671b\", right? So if the author wanted to say \"was visible\" east of Ulleungdo he should have said \"\u5cf6\u5dbc\u6771\u76f8\u671b \".\nActually I'm not 100% sure where exactly Korean considered Japanese territory is, since there is almost no clear record of Korean went to Japan on that sea route except for Ahn's inconsistant testimony. Rather I believe they didn't have enough perception what kind of islands exist where in the Sea of Japan between Oki islands. Choson government was interested in the territory which they can protect from Japan, not the islets no man can live on or attacked by Japan. The best explanation is that Korean considered the islands which is nearest to Jukdo (Liancourt Rocks or Oki) is the frontier of Japan and the sea between Jukdo and Japanese territorial islands (Takeshima or Oki) is the boundary. But this sentence clearly tells that Jukdo is the frontier of Choson which touches to the boundary between Japan. In the text, they are worrying about Japanese ships' coming to Choson, but not worrying about Japanese ships are voyaging in the sea of Japan. In 1694, Choson clearly recognised where exactly small island (Jukdo) is (2km east to Ulleundo) and in 1711, they idencified the island is so-called Usando (=Japanese Matsushima=Jukdo)that is the fromtier of Choson, not Ulleundo. They recorded on the official map. They didn't have to say the distance between Ulleundo and Jukdo since it is apparent. This text is confirming this recognition. Since Ulleundo had been still remained unsetteld for almost 200 more years until 1880's, Usando sometimes got ambiguous on Choson people's mind, but the concept that Usando(Jukdo) or Ulleundo which include Jukdo was the frontier of Choson, never had changed. until 1950's when Korean started to be aggressive to try to grab the territories from Japan, Tsushima, non-existant Palando and Takeshima. There is no record that Korean and Choson officials went futher from Jukdo for investigation.\nBy the way, chaamiey's opinion is almost same with mine.\n1. \"\u63a5\u4e8e\u502d\u5883\" means \"(Here(\u5cf6\u5dbc), Choson territory (Subject)) is in contact with their border with Japan.\n2. Subject on which Choson territory touhches to Japan as a border is \"\u5cf6\u5dbc\". Since the description of this islet is simple as \"\u9b31\u9675\u4e4b\u6771 \u5cf6\u5dbc\u76f8\u671b\", it is more likelyto be \"Jukdo\" which is near Ulleundo rather than \"Liancourt Rocks\". Liancourt Rocks is far from Ulleundo and nothing imply about this islets 92km from Ulleundo in the whole text.\nHe says it should be read as \"There is an island to the east of Ulleundo, and that is the border with Japan. (or beyond the island, it is Japanese territory.) if you put it simple.\nAnyway, as I said, it is perfectly OK that we don't agree on everything. So I respect your opinion.\nBut I'm going to ask Japanese professionals later. I'd like to hear their opinion, too.\nKaneganese, when I read your posts I don't know whether to laugh or cry.\nAs Gerry, pointed out, it is ridiculous to think Koreans would look at Jukdo Islet which is literally ten minutes rowing from Ulleungndo and deem this rock next to the boundary of Japan.\nKnowing there is an expanse of ocean lying beyond Ulleungdo it's pretty silly to assume Chosun thought the border was just a stones throw away. The fact the author mentions visibility leads us to believe the island was distant. You wouldn't describe a rock two clicks away as \"visible\".\nThe best translation is \"Visible to the East of Ullengdo is an island that is near, close to, or adjacent to the border of Japan\"\nThanks for translating of my opinion into English.\n\"Visible to the East of Ullengdo is an island that is near, close to, or adjacent to the border of Japan\"\nYou wrote the right thing for the FIRST time! This translation is quite near to Kaneganese's opinion.\nIt says that the island that is present at east of Ullengdo, Jukdo, is close to the border of Japan. So it means that beyond Jukdo is Japan's territory. And it also indicates that Liancourt rocks belong to Japan.\nSteve made a homerun for the first time! Good job!\nIt is ridiculous to claim that the 1714 passage was saying that Japan's border extended to up Ulleungdo's Jukdo. Why would Koreans have thought that? For example, ignoring Takeshima for a minute,would Japanese have thought that the Korean border extended up to Oki Island? No, right?\nAt the time, your border extended up your most remote island, not beyond to someone else's most remote island. Even though Koreans try to make the argument that Liancourt Rocks was Korean territory because it was within eyesight of Ulleungdo, this 1714 passage shows that Koreans considered Liancourt Rocks to be on the border of Japanese territory, which means they believed the island to be Japanese.\nThe character \u63a5 means to \"connect,\" \"join,\" or \"touch,\" which means, at least, two things or objects are needed to join, touch, or connect. The two objects in the 1714 passage were the island east of Ulleungdo and the Japanese border. Ulleungdo or Korea's border (\u5883) was not mentioned, which means the passage was not talking about the Japanese and Korean borders touching. It was talking about the island east of Ulluengdo and the Japanese border touching or connecting.\nKorea would not have considered Japanese territory extending up to a Korean island, and Japan would also not have considered Korean territory extending up to a Japanese island. Therefore, since the 1714 passage said that the Japanese border touched the island east of Ulleungdo, that means that the Koreans believed the island to be Japanese, not Korean.\nIn my opinion, that is the only logical conclusion.\nAt this point, Korea lost one point. I have a stronger logic for you. Read my correct translation.\nAs you wrote, \"At the time, your border extended up your most remote island, not beyond to someone else's most remote island\".\nSo Saito Hosen thought Ulleungdo was Japan's \"limit\" - he thought Ulleungdo was the most remote island of Japan.\nLooking from Korean side, the most remote island was Jukdo of Ulleungdo. So they thought that Jukdo contacts with the borderline. The area within Jukdo was Korean territory.\nIsn't this logical?\nYes, if Saito Hosen believed that Ulleungdo was Japanese territory, then he would have thought that the Japanese border extended to Ulleungdo, but he would not have thought that the Japanese border extended beyond Ulleungdo to the Korean coastline.\nYes, Koreans would have thought that Ulleungdo's Jukdo was the edge of their border.\nPacifist, you said Jukdo, not me. There is no logical reason why the people from Gangwan who frequented Ulluengdo would consider a large rock only 2kms from Ulleundo to be \"near the border of Japan.\" Especially when we consider they context describes distant Japan and the large expanse of sea beyond Korea. That is pretty ridiculous.\nThat means if the Koreans sailed for 20 minutes East they would be in Japanese territory. I totally disagree.\nGerry, as I've said the character \"\u63a5\" is meant to mean near or adjacent or adjoining to. It is pronounced as \uc811\ud558\ub2e4 in this case.\nAnd if you look at the usage of \u201c\uc811\ud558\ub2e4\u201d it is different than that of \u201c\uc787\ub2e4\u201d In Korean the term \"\uc811\ud558\ub2e4\u201c is meant for places. (such as In this case means is close to, adjacent to or comes in contact to. In all of these cases the island to the East is outside of Japan's territory and either is near or touches but it is not part of the boundary.\nThe term \"\uc787\ub2e4\u201c means connects but it is used for \"linking\" objects such as strings, threads, tables or pieces of objects. Again check the usage of each form of the character."

Although the GOCI has shown excellent radiometric performance with little long-term radiometric degradation and a high signal-to-noise ratio, there are radiometric artefacts in GOCI Level 1 products caused by stray light detected within the GOCI optics. To correct the radiometric bias, we developed an image-based correction algorithm called the correction of the interslot discrepancy using the minimum noise fraction transform (CIDUM) in a previous study and evaluated its performance with respect to the physical radiometric quantity stored in Level 1 products, i.e., top-of-atmosphere radiance. This study evaluated the performance of the CIDUM algorithm in terms of remote sensing reflectance, which is one of the most important products in ocean color remote sensing. The resultant CIDUM-corrected remote sensing reflectance products were validated using both relative (within the image) and absolute references (in situ measurements). Image validation showed that CIDUM corrected the bias in remote sensing reflectance (up to 20%) and reduced the bias to?5% in the tested image. In situ validation showed that relative uncertainty was reduced by around 10% within the visible bands and the correlation between the in situ and GOCI radiometric data was enhanced.\nFigure. (a) Images of GOCI remote sensing reflectance acquired on 16 October 2012 (UTC 04) for Band 6 both before and after the CIDUM correction; (b) Profile of remote sensing reflectance along transect PQ.\nThis paper reanalyzes the aerosol reflectance correction schemes employed by major ocean color missions. The utilization of two near-infrared (NIR) bands to estimate aerosol reflectance in visible wavelengths has been widely adopted, for example by SeaWiFS/MODIS/VIIRS (GW1994), OCTS/GLI/SGLI (F1998), MERIS/OLCI (AM1999), and GOCI/GOCI-II (A2016). The F1998, AM1999, and A2016 schemes were developed based on GW1994; however, they are implemented differently in terms of aerosol model selection and weighting factor computation. The F1998 scheme determines the contribution of the most appropriate aerosol models in the aerosol optical thickness domain, whereas the GW1994 scheme focuses on single-scattering reflectance. The AM1999 and A2016 schemes both directly resolve the multiple scattering domain contribution. However, A2016 also considers the spectrally dependent weighting factor, whereas AM1999 calculates the spectrally invariant weighting factor. Additionally, ocean color measurements on a geostationary platform, such as GOCI, require more accurate aerosol correction schemes because the measurements are made over a large range of solar zenith angles which causes diurnal instabilities in the atmospheric correction. Herein, the four correction schemes were tested with simulated top-of-atmosphere radiances generated by radiative transfer simulations for three aerosol models. For comparison, look-up tables and test data were generated using the same radiative transfer simulation code. All schemes showed acceptable accuracy, with less than 10% median error in water reflectance retrieval at 443 nm. Notably, the accuracy of the A2016 scheme was similar among different aerosol models, whereas the other schemes tended to provide better accuracy with coarse aerosol models than the fine aerosol models.\nFigure. Water reflectance (\u03c1wn) retrieval accuracy of the (a) blue; (b) green; and (c) red bands in the atmospheric correction algorithm after integrating the four aerosol correction schemes. Chlorophyll-a estimation error based on OC3 [33] is plotted in (d).\nTidal flats are associated with complicated depositional and ecological environments, and have changed considerably as a result of the erosion and sedimentation caused by tidal energy; consequently, the surface sediment distribution in tidal flats must be constantly monitored and mapped. Although several studies have been conducted with the aim of classifying intertidal surface sediments using various remote sensing methods combined with field survey, most of these studies were unable to consider various sediment types, due to the low spatial resolution of remotely sensed data. Therefore, previous studies were unable to efficiently describe precise surface sediment distribution maps. In the present study, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) red, green, blue (RGB) orthoimagery was used in combination with a field survey (232 samples) to produce a large-scale classification map for surface sediment distribution, in accordance with sedimentology standards, using an object-based method. The object-based method is an effective technique that can classify surface sediment distribution by analyzing its correlations with spectral reflectance, grain size, and tidal channels. Therefore, we distinguished six sediment types based on their spectral reflectance and sediment properties, such as grain composition and statistical parameters. The accuracy assessment of the surface sediment classification based on these six types indicated an overall accuracy of 72.8%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.62 and 5-m error range related to the Global Positioning System (GPS) device. We found that 11 samples were misclassified due to the effects of sun glint and cloud caused by the UAV system and shellfish beds, while 14 misclassified samples were influenced by surface water related to the elevation, tidal channels, and sediment properties. These results indicate that large-scale classification of surface sediment with high accuracy is possible using UAV RGB orthoimagery.\nFigure. Large-scale surface sediment classification map derived from the UAV RGB orthoimage. The overall accuracy is 72.8%, with a 5-m error range, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.62.\nSince 2008, floating green tides (Ulva sp.) have been occurring continuously in the Yellow Sea (YS), and after 2013 floating golden tides (Sargassum sp.) have also occurred. The distribution, areal coverage, and migration of floating green tides have been actively studied, but most research has focused only on the western YS. Little is known about the floating golden tides in the eastern YS. The purpose of this study was to determine the long-term distribution of floating green and golden tides in the eastern YS using Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Landsat satellite images from 2008 to 2017. In addition, the migration of floating macroalgae with Global Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) surface current data were compared. Green tides were observed in 2008, 2009, 2011, 2015, and 2016 in the eastern YS. From a satellite image backtracking analysis, it was confirmed that the green tides observed in the eastern YS were supplied from the western YS. When the maximum areal coverage of green tide was compared between the eastern and western YS, the coverage in the eastern YS was found to be about 4 % of that of the western YS. However, in 2011, the largest amount of floating macroalgae was found in the eastern YS and it accounted for about 45 % of the amount in the western part of the YS. In the eastern YS, floating golden tides were found in 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017, with the largest amount of floating macroalgae occurring in 2017. Although there were no long-term golden tide data for the western YS, such that it was not compared to the areal coverage of the eastern YS, it was confirmed that the amount of golden tide supplied to the eastern YS gradually increased. A comparison between the migration of floating macroalgae and HYCOM surface current data suggested that the migration and flow directions were not identical, and were considerably affected by surface ocean currents during their passage into the eastern YS. From this study, the long-term distribution and changes in areal coverage of green and golden tides in the eastern YS were obtained for the first time. This information will be useful for understanding the long-term patterns of green and golden tides, and provides basic data for predicting the occurrence and migration of floating macroalgae.\nFigure1. Long-term trend of green tides in the eastern YS.\nFigure2. Long-term trend of golden tides in the eastern YS.\nWe show two major modes of East Asian marine heatwaves (MHWs) associated with two contrasting sea surface temperature patterns over the subtropical western North Pacific (WNP). In the first MHW mode, ocean warming over East Asia occurs along with the subtropical WNP from the earlier winter by an El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation. The basin-wide ocean warming is finally intensified to an extreme warming state around East Asia, where a high-pressure region in zonal waves across the Eurasian continent passes. In contrast, at the early stage, the second MHW mode is unfavorable with ocean cooling. However, MHWs over East Asia occur due to a significant intensification of a zonally elongated high-pressure zone in response to anomalous subtropical convection in addition to mid-latitude zonal waves. Due to the importance of persistent ocean warming as well as immediate atmospheric forcing, MHW inducible oceanic and atmospheric interactions are clearly distinguishable from those of atmospheric heatwaves.\nFigure. Schematic pictures illustrating how two primary modes of East Asian marine heatwaves are affected by global-scale climate variabilities (CGT, WNP convection, and the equatorial SST pattern): (a) Mode 1 (basin-wide warming pattern) and (b) Mode 2 (dipole warming pattern).\nGeostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) observations are applied to marine fog (MF) detection in combination with Himawari-8 data based on the decision tree"

Uleungdo was an abbreviation of \"The Two Islands of Usan/Muleung\" (\u4e8e\u5c71\u6b66\u9675\u4e8c\u5cf6), which was \"one name two island\" (\u4e8c\u5cf6\u4e00\u540d) name for the islands Usanguk (\u4e8e\u5c71\u570b - Ulleungdo) and Muleungdo (\u6b66\u9675\u5cf6).\nDuring the Silla period, the formal name of Ulleungdo and Dokdo was \"The Two Islands of Usan/Muleung,\" which was used together with its abbreviated name \"Uleungdo.\" Dr. Seonu claimed that he has confirmed that the name, \"The Two Islands of Usan/Muleung,\" was used formally in documents, but that \"Uleungdo\" was used in everyday life.\nBefore 512 A.D., the people who set up a country on Ulleungdo were cognizant of \"Dokdo\" and used it as an essential territory. At the time, the concept of \"the two islands were not far apart, so they could be seen on a clear day\" (\u4e8c\u5cf6\u76f8\u8ddd\u4e0d\u9060\u98a8\u65e5\u6df8\u660e\u537d\u53ef\u671b\u898b) was established.\nDr. Seonu said that in 512 A.D. Usanguk became a part of Silla, the name \"Muleungdo\" was formed, and then the written expression \"The two islands of Usan/Muleung are in the sea due east of the hyeon\" was established.\nWhile the name \"Uleungdo\" (\u4e8e\u9675\u5cf6) was used for Ulleungdo and Dokdo in Silla and Usanguk, the name \"Ulleungdo\" started to be used as a dialect in the east coast region of Gangwon. In 1018 A.D., Usanguk fell, and the Gangwondo dialect name also became the commonly used name during the Koryo period.\nDr. Seonu determined that the final name for Ulleungdo and Dokdo went from \"Muleungdo\" (\u6b66\u9675\u5cf6) to \"The Two Islands of Usan/Muleung in the Sea Due East of the Hyeon\" (\u4e8e\u5c71\u6b66\u9675\u4e8c\u5cf6\u5728\u7e23\u6b63\u6771\u6d77\u4e2d), to \"Uleungdo\" (\u4e8e\u9675\u5cf6), to Ulleungdo (\u851a\u9675\u5cf6), to Ulleungdo (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6).\nSince \"Ulleungdo\" (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6) was the very last name for Ulleungdo and Dokdo, it is assumed that when Kim Bu-sik was compiling the Samguksagi, he mistakenly wrote \"Muleungdo\" (\u851a\u9675\u5cf6) as \"Ulleungdo\" (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6).\nOn maps in the latter Joseon, Usando was shown as Ulleungdo's Jukdo (Daetseom), and it is believed that during the time of [King ] Jeongjo and [King] Kojong, the name \"Songjukdo\" [\u677e\u7af9\u5cf6] applied to Dokdo, which demonstrated management and intent.\nDr. Seonu said, \"When you look at the name transition of Dokdo, the possesion of Dokdo was already established during the time of Usanguk and continued unbroken through Silla, Koryo, and Joseon.\" He added, \"Based on international law, Dokdo was never Japanese territory, and Japan only failed in its attempt to make it its territory.\"\nDr. Seonu advocates, \"We need to use Dokdo's original name of \"Muleung\" as a basis and compose a 'Muleungdwon' [Muleungdo Garden?] using Dokdo and ecological technology. Then we have to occasionally promote a plan that uses 'a place of dreams and romance.'\"\nAnd he repeat Sanbongdo is Dokdo before.....on 27th of Oct in the news?\nTo defend fairy tale theory of Korean about Liancourt Rocks, they would use another false theory and it makes more complicated situation into hell themselves...<|endoftext|>Trying to lose weight can be a monotonous task that never seems to lead anywhere. You start out motivated and ready to conquer the world, but fear and confusion can put a damper on that feeling pretty fast. What secrets are used by those people that do manage to lose weight and keep it off? Which methods do they use to accomplish this?\nYour first step is to determine your specific weight loss goals. Make the decision of whether you want to just lose weight or tone your muscles. Are you aiming to reach a certain weight? Maybe you just want to be stronger and have more stamina.\nContemplate keeping a journal that tracks your weight loss. You can make your daily entries as brief or as detailed as you like. For instance, you can simply include a list of the foods you ate at each meal and your weight for that day. As you keep your food diary, use it to compare your weight loss to your diet. Make whatever adjustments you need to stay on track.\nEat small amounts of healthy food frequently to avoid becoming overly hungry and grabbing anything at hand. Avoid being faced with poor choices unexpectedly by planning your meals and snacks for each day and packing them to take along wherever you go. It is a good idea to bring a lunch with you from home. Not only will eating at home save money, but it will also reduce your calorie and fat intake.\nA successful weight loss program consists of proper eating habits along with regular exercise. Schedule fun work out activities a few times every week. Finding the exercises that you enjoy will help you push past those old excuses about not having enough time. Do you like to spend time with your guy friends? Then you could play a game of basketball with them, or some other sport you like. Are you a wild one? Hit a Jazzercise class! Are you more comfortable with nature? Put on your hiking boots and enjoy nature while walking toward fitness.\nTake all junk food out of your house. By filling your kitchen with fresh fruits and vegetables, you won\u2019t have the temptation available. If there isn\u2019t any junk food around, you won\u2019t be tempted to eat it when hunger strikes.\nHave your friends support you in whatever way they are able. Assistance from friends can be a great motivator for you while you work on your weight loss goals. You may even find some people willing to make healthy lifestyle changes with you! Having to answer to someone other than yourself can help keep you from giving up when you are feeling discouraged. Try calling a friend if you are in need of some additional encouragement. They can give you the advice and assistance you need to overcome any problem and get back on track to achieving your weight loss goal.<|endoftext|>Success(es)/struggle(s) of the week:Weight stay the same this week.

These features have potential to be meaningfully organized, relate to specific BPD presentation, and have implications for treatment process and outcome. The present study explored patterns of Axis II comorbidity in order to identify subtypes of BPD.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA well-defined sample of 90 patients diagnosed with BPD was recruited as part of an RCT study. Participants were administered the International Personality Disorder Examination (Loranger, 1999) to diagnose BPD and assess comorbid Axis II features. Other measures were also administered to assess aspects of current work and relationship functioning, symptomatology, and self-concept.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nQ-factoring was used to develop subtypes based on commonly occurring Axis II profiles, identifying three: Cluster A (elevated paranoid and schizotypal features), Cluster B (elevated narcissistic and histrionic features), and Cluster C (elevated avoidant and obsessive-compulsive features). An additional factor analysis revealed two dimensions underlying the comorbid features identifiable as: extraversion versus introversion and antagonism versus constraint. Validity of these two maps of comorbidity was explored in terms of the BPD criteria themselves, as well as on work and relationship functioning, identity diffusion, views of self and others, positive and negative affect, behavioural dyscontrol, and symptomatic distress.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nClinically meaningful subtypes can be identified for BPD based on co-occurring Axis II features. Further research is needed to replicate and further establish base-rates of these subtypes as well as their differential implications for treatment.<|endoftext|>In Dollars and Uncommon Sense, Army veteran and Certified Financial Planner Steve Repak shows you why, and how, to use uncommon sense to get back on track.

The above record is not unique, but one of many that show that Usando could not have been Liancourt Rocks (Dokdo).\nThe reason Koreans claim that Usando was Liancourt Rocks (Dokdo) is that without making such a claim, Korea would have no record or map before 1905 showing that she even knew about the rocks, much less claimed them. The problem is that there is nothing mentioned about Usando in Korean historical documents that would even suggest that Usando was Liancourt Rocks (Dokdo). On the contrary, all the evidence suggest that Usando was a neighboring island of Ulleungdo, most likely Jukdo, which is a small island less than four kilometers off Ulleungdo\u2019s east coast.\nNow that Nora has disappeared after I exposed \u2018her\u2019, there is no one around in the Korea related blogosphere to write about lesbian issues. I will make an attempt in true finger chopping wacky Occidentalism style.\nHere is a story. A guy in New York tries to pick up a girl, fails, spits on the girl or one of her friends, and is then attacked by a group 7 of lesbians. Story courtesy of Gay.com (standard denial \u2013 I am not a regular reader of Gay.com).\nSeven lesbians from Newark, N.J., attacked and seriously injured a street vendor in New York\u2019s West Village early Friday after the man grew angry when his advances to one woman were not returned, the New York Daily News reported.\nPolice said the women whipped Wayne Buckle, 28, with belts; the subject of his attentions, Patreese Johnson, 19, then stabbed him repeatedly with a steak knife, the Daily News said.\nI suspect these New York lesbians are a very tough breed (excuse the pun).\nOne of the women yelled \u201cShe\u2019s my girl, and no one hits on my girl!\u201d during the incident, a police source told the paper.\nThe lesbian that said that is definitely going to a womens prison. I thought the prison system was supposed to be punishment, not a reward.\nBuckle was recovering at a New York hospital in critical but stable condition.\nA \u201chate crime\u201d indeed. After beating him senseless with belts, and stabbing him repeatedly with a knife, they were arrested a block away from the crime scene, according to WNBC News.That means they ran away from the crime scene \u2013 I dont know why the article just does not come out and say it.\nThe stab victim was interviewed from hospital by the New York Daily News.\nAn oxygen tube pumping air into his lungs, the 28-year-old man allegedly beaten and stabbed in the West Village by a gang of petite lesbians described the attack yesterday from his hospital bed.\nStill shaken by Friday\u2019s terrifying assault, Buckle, an independent filmmaker from Queens, said he felt he was the victim of a bias attack.\nSeveral witnesses and police sources said Buckle sparked the attack by spitting on a 19-year-old lesbian after she rejected his advances outside the IFC movie theater on Sixth Ave. near W. Third St. He also allegedly cursed the woman, Patrice Johnson, using gay slurs.\nJohnson and six of her friends \u2013 all lesbians from New Jersey \u2013 pounced on Buckle at 2 a.m., whipping him with belts before Johnson stabbed him repeatedly in the belly with a 4-inch serrated steak knife, authorities said.\nBuckle was bleeding badly after the attack. \nThe seven suspects were arraigned early yesterday on charges of attempted murder, assault and gang assault. They were ordered held on $50,000 cash bail or $150,000 bond.\nHis eyes swollen, Buckle was hooked up to a respirator yesterday. He denied that he had provoked the attack and insisted he was not homophobic.\nI dont know. It is hard to tell exactly what happened here, but it looks like the lesbians wanted to escalate the situation because they were clearly willing to use violence. Normal people do not just go out and stab people, even if they suffer considerable provocation. Being spit on is not enough provocation to beat and stab someone so badly they need to go on a respirator, in my opinion. If I were the NY police, I would be looking for a history of altercations with straight men by the perpetrators.\nThat sure beats anything Kushibo/Nora ever wrote about lesbians!\nAn editorial about Yasukuni and all things relevant by George F. Will on the Washingon Post\u2019s site. HT to Richard of TPD.\nLeftist ideology causes South Korea\u2019s regime to cultivate victimhood and resentment of a Japan imagined to have expansionism in its national DNA. The choice by China\u2019s regime is more interesting. Marxism is bankrupt and causes cognitive dissonance as China pursues economic growth by markedly un-Marxist means. So China\u2019s regime, needing a new source of legitimacy, seeks it in memories of resistance to Japanese imperialism.\nActually, most of China\u2019s resistance was by Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s forces, Mao\u2019s enemies. And Mao, to whom there is a sort of secular shrine in Beijing, killed millions more Chinese than even Japan\u2019s brutal occupiers did.\nThe museum adjacent to Yasukuni says \u201cThe Greater East Asian War\u201d began because, when the New Deal failed to banish the Depression, \u201cthe only option open to Roosevelt... was to use embargoes to force resource-poor Japan into war. The U.S. economy made a complete recovery once the Americans entered the war.\u201d That is disgracefully meretricious \u2014 and familiar. For years a small but vocal cadre of Americans \u2014 anti-FDR zealots \u2014 said approximately that. But neither Koizumi nor Abe includes the museum in his visits to the shrine.\nThings are so bad that, speaking about the incessant incursions by Chinese submarines and military aircraft into Japanese sea and air spaces, a senior Japanese official casually made the startling suggestion that China\u2019s regime, like Japan\u2019s regime before the war, does not fully control its military.\nThe controversy about Yasukuni should not mystify Americans. With their comparatively minor but still acrimonious arguments about displays of Confederate flags, Americans know how contentious the politics of national memory can be, and they understand the problem of honoring war dead without necessarily honoring the cause for which they died.\nUPDATE: I just got a TV yesterday. I just saw a news discussion program that mentioned the images shown here below as being a recent and in response to Koizumi\u2019s recent Yasukuni visit.\nORIGINAL: \u2605\u53b3\u9078\uff01\u97d3\u56fd\u60c5\u5831\u2605 has a a collection of pictures from demonstrations in Korea I have never seen before.

So, it makes sense to adjust the thermostat setting if our comfort level changes throughout the day, right? If you\u2019re only concerned with not being too warm or cool, the answer would be \u201cYes.\u201d However, that strategy can be costly in multiple ways.\nA better approach is to determine setpoints for heating and cooling and maintain them throughout the day.\nYou\u2019re not alone if you tend to \u201ctweak\u201d your thermostat setting several times a day. It\u2019s common to believe that a few degrees in temperature change here and there won\u2019t make a difference. But that misconception can cost you.\nUse more energy. Every time your HVAC system kicks on, you\u2019re using more energy. And depending on what you\u2019re asking of your equipment, it may require a significant amount of energy. You\u2019re naturally thinking about the need for a temperature change right where you are, but your HVAC system must raise or lower the temperature throughout the zone controlled by the thermostat. That means your entire home for most residential systems, for example.\nIncrease your utility bill. Every time your furnace or air conditioner cycles on, you\u2019re spending money. It\u2019s easy to overlook that fact since you don\u2019t see the increase in your bill in real time. But regardless, the cost is accruing.\nIncrease wear and tear"

It was designed to be used in the lifting of heavy equipment, such as engines and boilers, during the fitting-out of battleships and ocean liners at the John Brown & Company shipyard. It was also the world's first electrically powered cantilever crane, and the largest crane of its type at the time of its completion.\nSituated at the end of a U-shaped fitting out basin, the crane was used to construct some of the largest ships of the 20th century, including the Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth and Queen Elizabeth 2. The Category A Listed historical structure was refurbished in 2007 as a tourist attraction and shipbuilding museum. It is featured on the current Clydesdale Bank \u00a35 note.\nThe shipyard at Clydebank was created in 1871 after the company James & George Thomson moved from the Graving Docks in Govan. John Brown & Company purchased the yard in 1899, and in 1905, a \u00a324,600 order for the crane was placed with Dalmarnock based engineering company Sir William Arrol & Co. Titan was completed two years later in 1907. It was constructed by the Scottish engineer Adam Hunter (1869\u20131933), who was working as Chief Engineer for Arrol & Co., having served his apprenticeship on the construction of the Forth Bridge. Stothert & Pitt of Bath, England, fabricated and installed most of the machinery for the Titan, including electric motors built by Lancashire Dynamo and Motor Co.\nThe dock was used for fitting out new vessels, and the crane lifted engines and boilers into ships. The lifting capacity of the Titan, and the location of the yard at the confluence of the River Clyde and River Cart, contributed to the success of the yard as it could build extremely large ships.\nWhen tested on 24 April 1907, Titan was the largest cantilever crane ever built with a capacity of 160 tonnes (160 long tons; 180 short tons) at a radius of 85 feet (26 m). The original lift capacity was uprated to 203 long tons (206 t) in 1938, when it became apparent that the original specification would be insufficient to install the new long range gun's turrets into ships such as the Duke of York.\nOn the nights of 13 and 14 March 1941, the Clydebank Blitz virtually destroyed the town. 528 civilians were killed, over 617 people were seriously injured, and 48,000 civilians lost their homes. Only seven properties in Clydebank were undamaged, in one of the worst bombing raids in Britain. The raids, involving 260 Luftwaffe bombers on the first night and 200 on the second, targeted the industry of Clydeside, but the Titan crane was undamaged.\nIn 1968, the yard was amalgamated into Upper Clyde Shipbuilders along with four others, in an attempt to increase competitiveness. The general elections in 1970 saw a change of government, and funding for the yard was withheld, resulting in the closure of John Brown's. It was bought from the receivers by the Houston, Texas-based Marathon Manufacturing Company for oil rig construction. In 1980 Marathon sold the yard to the French company Union Industrielle et d\u2019Entreprise (UiE). UIE's owners, Bouygues Offshore closed the yard in 2001 and the site was earmarked for redevelopment.\nShips constructed by the crane include HMS Hood, the Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth, Queen Elizabeth 2, and the Royal Yacht Britannia.\nThe ticket office (also known as the Pursers Office) and information centre at the Titan Crane, featuring a silhouette of the RMS Queen Mary.\nThe crane fell into disuse in 1980s, and in the intervening period of neglect, the crane suffered vandalism to the wheelhouse and corrosion to the structure. In 1988 the crane was recognised as a Category A Listed historical structure.\nThe urban regeneration company Clydebank Re-Built started a \u00a33.75m restoration project in 2005, and the crane opened to the public in August 2007. The structure was shot-blasted to remove old paint and rust, allowing repairs to be undertaken before repainting. A lift for visitors to ascend to the jib and an emergency evacuation stair were installed, along with a wire mesh around the viewing area and floodlights to illuminate the crane at night.\nIn 2015, a bungee jump was added.\nThe Titan Crane's jib has been converted into a public viewing platform.\nThe Titan used a fixed counterweight and electrically operated hoists all mounted on a rotated beam, making it faster and more responsive than its steam powered predecessors. For lifting smaller assemblies that did not require the full lifting capacity of 150 tonnes (150 long tons; 170 short tons), a 30 tonnes (30 long tons; 33 short tons) auxiliary hoist was used, as large loads were comparatively rare.\nTitan is 49 metres (161 ft) high, weighs about 800 tonnes (790 long tons; 880 short tons) and sits on four concrete piles sunk to a depth of 23 metres (75 ft) deep. The arms of the cantilever are 45.7 metres (150 ft) and 27.4 metres (90 ft) long. The tower is 12 metres (39 ft) square, and its centre sits just 10.7 metres (35 ft) from the edge of the quay.\nFollowing the removal of the Beardmore Crane in the 1970s and the Fairfield Titan in 2007, there are now four giant cantilever cranes on the River Clyde. The others are at Stobcross (Finnieston Crane), Scotstoun (Barclay Curle Crane) and Greenock (James Watt Dock Crane). Fewer than sixty giant cantilever cranes were built worldwide, six of them on the Clyde, and as of May 2011, it is believed only eleven remained, four of those on the Clyde.\nThe crane was awarded the 2012 Engineering Heritage Award by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and described as \"a magnificent example of mechanical engineering, which forms an integral part of the local landscape\". Titan was designated as an International Historic Civil and Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 2013, the fifth such award given to a Scottish structure.\nFor the restoration of the structure, recognition was accorded by Chicago Athenaeum Award for Architecture in 2008 and by the Civic Trust in 2009.\nTitan Clydebank Facts for Kids.

Consequently, in February of that year, the governor of Shimane Prefecture issued an official notification that Dokdo was to be put under the jurisdiction of the Okinoshima office of Shimane Prefecture.\nJapan illegally occupied Dokdo during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905.\nIn January, 1905, during the Russo-Japanese War, Japan incorporated Dokdo under the rationale of the acquisition of sovereignty over terra nullius. However, such an excuse was modified as \u201ca reaffirmation of Japan\u2019s intention to claim sovereignty over Dokdo\u201d because Japan realized that its own rationale of \u201cDokdo has always been Japanese territory\u201d and \u201coccupation of terra nullius\u201d conflicted with each other. Its claim, \u201coccupation of terra nullius,\u201d contradicted Japan\u2019s previous argument that Dokdo had no relationship with Japan, which is also shown in the State Council (Dajokan) Directive of 1877.\nThe Russo-Japanese War began in 1904 when the Japanese Navy launched a surprise attack against the Russian Pacific Fleet at Port Arthur and at Jemulpo. The Japanese Navy built watch towers at Jejudo, Geomundo, and Ulsan in order to monitor the movement of the Russian fleet. In August of 1904, two watch towers were installed in Ulleungdo, too, actions which stressed the strategic value of Dokdo.\nNakai Yozaburo was aware that Dokdo belonged to Joseon. He intended to submit a request for the lease of the island to the Joseon government through the Japanese government. However, Nakai submitted a petition to incorporate Dokdo, instead of a lease request, to the Japanese government in September of 1904, having been influenced by officials of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Japanese Navy Department.\nThe Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs attempted to reject his petition based upon the opinion that \u201cthe gains would be extremely small while the situation would become grave if the acquisition of a barren islet (Dokdo) suspected of being Korean territory...would amplify the suspicions of various foreign countries that Japan had an ambition to annex Korea.\u201d However, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs proceeded to incorporate the island with the rationale that hostile warships would be better monitored if watch towers were constructed, and wireless or submarine cables were installed there.\nJapan\u2019s incorporation of Dokdo in 1905 is void by international law. Japan argues that it incorporated the island based on the rationale of \u201coccupation of terra nullius.\u201d However, Korea had established its sovereignty over Dokdo in ancient times, and reaffirmed this under the modern law by issuing Imperial Ordinance No. 41 (see Material 9) on October 25, 1900.\nJapan discussed and notified its incorporation of Dokdo to Western countries, including the United States. However, Korea did not receive any query or notification regarding the unilateral incorporation. In March of 1906 the Governor of Uldo (Ulleungdo) learned of the incorporation from Japanese officials of Shimane Prefecture visiting Ulleungdo. The next day, the Governor of Uldo reported this to the central government in Seoul and to the governor of Gangwon-do. On receiving this report, the Minister of Interior and the State Council Minister stated that it is groundless for Japan to claim sovereignty over Dokdo, and ordered an investigation of the facts relating to what Japan had done. (See Material 10.) The Korean government, having been deprived of its diplomatic rights following the protectorate treaty in November 1905, was not able to take any diplomatic action against such a situation. However, Korean newspapers, including the Daehan Daily Newspaper (Daehan maeil sinbo) (May 1, 1906) (see Material 11) and The Hwangseong Newspaper (Hwangseong sinmun) (May 9, 1906), published articles protesting against the Japanese act.\nThe Gazette Containing Imperial Ordinance No. 41Korea renamed Ulleungdo as Uldo, and raised the highest administrative position in Ulleungdo to County Magistrate of Uldo. The County Magistrate gained authority over the whole of Ulleungdo, Jukdo, and Seokdo. Korean Imperial Ordinance No. 41 was issued in Korean Gazette No. 1716 on October 27, 1900.\nIn 1906, the Chuncheon County Magistrate and acting Governor of Gangwon-do Lee Myeong-nae informed State Council Minister Park Je-sun of Japan\u2019s incorporation of Dokdo, which belonged to Korea, immediately after this Japanese act was reported by the Uldo (Ulleungdo) Governor Sim Heung-taek. In response to this, Park stated that Japan\u2019s claims to Dokdo were unfounded and through Order No. 3 commanded that a close eye be kept on the situation on Dokdo and the movements of the Japanese there.<|endoftext|>How to have a good orgasm male Chat rooms for mature folk.

Who told the Korean government that Liancourt Rocks was Korean territory?\nWell, according to Yu Jin-o ((\u6d2a\u937e\u4ec1), who was quoted in the article, the Korean Prime Minister at the time told him that Korean President Rhee Syng-man had tasked him with finding out the boundaries of Korean territory. The Korean Prime Minister said the Korean President recommended that he go to Korean historians for the answers. As a result, the Prime Minister went to the renowned Korean historian Choi Nam-seon (\u5d14\u5357\u5584), who told him that old Korean texts recorded that Korea's easternmost boundry was \"Dokdo\" (\u7368\u5cf6) and its southwestern boundary was Parangseo (\u6ce2\u6d6a\u5dbc).\nI think Mr. Choi Nam-seon mistook Ulleungdo's neighboring island of \"Jukdo\" (\u7af9\u5cf6), which is only 2 km off Ulleungdo's east shore, for Japan's \"Takeshima\" (\u7af9\u5cf6), which is about 90 km to the southeast of Ulleungdo, because both names used the same Chinese characters: \u7af9\u5cf6. And I think Korea's Patriotic Old Men's Association made the same mistake. In fact, Choi Nam-seon may have even been one of those Patriotic Old Men.\nHere is my translation of the June 16, 1973 article.\n\"In Science there are no miracles. We are at sea at coordinates 32\u00ba 10' N and 125\u00ba E. Within the twenty mile range of visibility, Parang Island cannot be detected.\"\nIn August 1951 Mr. Hong Jong-in (\u6d2a\u937e\u4ec1), the head of the research team sent to find Parang Island in the sea 180 kilometers (km) to the southwest of Jejudo, sent the above cable to Son Won-il (\u5b6b\u5143\u4e00), the Chief of Naval Operations. At the time Mr. Hong was the chairman of the Korean Alpine Club and editor-in-chief of the Chosun Ilbo.\nWhen the United States and Japan were making the first draft of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, the research team sent to find Parang Island, with the help of the navy, searched the waters 180 km southwest of Jejudo, but, in the end, were unable to find it.\nFor now, Jeju authorities have returned his application, giving the reason, \"It shows up as a reef on navigational charts and is outside our territory.\" However, the question is whether it is really an island coming up out of the sea at that location or whether it is part of the contiental shelf. If it is part of the continental shelf, then how it will be treated under international law becomes a question of interest.\nHan Gwang-seop said, \"Navigational charts show that spot labeled only as as \"current breaks.\" It is obvious that it is not an island above the surface of the water.\" According to the (Geneva) Convention on the Law of the Sea, 'An island is a natural area that is surrounded by water and sticks up out of the water at high tide.' It defines an area that naturally sticks up above the water at low tide but is submerged at high tide as an 'elevated area.' If an elevated area is outside territorial waters, it cannot have its own territorial waters.\"\nIn 1951 the naval vessel ordered by President Rhee to do the first on-site search ended up not finding it.\nIf it is submerged at high tide, it is not an island.\nIf it is part of the continental shelf, it becomes a problem dealt with under international law, which would generate a lot of interest.\nAt the time of the evacuation to Busan, I went to see Prime Minister Jang Myeon (\u5f35\u52c9), who said he had been instructed by the President to find the borders of our territory. He was told to prepare for Korea-Japan talks by first meeting with historians. Therefore, he met Choi Nam-seon (\u5d14\u5357\u5584), who told him that old texts recorded our territory as Dokdo (\u7368\u5cf6) to the east and Parangseo (\u6ce2\u6d6a\u5dbc) to the southwest, so he said we should do an on-site survey. Hong Jong-il (\u6d2a\u937e\u4ec1) was made the team leader, and a naval survey team was sent to the site, but they were unable to find the island in the end.\nMisters Yu Jin-o (\u516a\u93ad\u5348) and Hong Jong-in (\u6d2a\u937e\u4ec1) said that if it is only a reef and not an island, then it cannot be a territorial issue or be subject to administration with an occupation permit under international law, but if it can be confirmed as an island, then we could argue that our territory should be extended out to there. An official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said on the 19th, \"If it submerges at high tide and appears at low tide, it is an elevated area that is not recognized as an island under international law, and a place like that cannot be the object of possession.\"\nThe experts say that the issue with Parang Island is still unconfirmed, and even if it is confirmed, it will still remain open seas if it is a reef and not be a territorial issue.\nIn an August 5, 1948 letter of petition to General Douglas MacArthur, a Korean organization known as the Patriotic Old Men's Association claimed that a \"series of islands\" named \"Parangdo\" belonged to Korea, but in spite of listing coordinates for the islands and giving distances to them HERE, no one could find them, so Korea dropped its claim.\nHowever, in the following June 16, 1973 article, the Korean newspaper Maeil Gyeongje Sinmun reported the discovery of two newly discovered islands 177.6 kilometers to the southwest of Jeju Island (\u6fdf\u5dde\u5cf6). The Korean man who discovered them named them \"Parangseo\" (\ud30c\ub791\uc11c) and \"Harangseo\" (\ud558\ub791\uc11c).\nIn the open sea 177.6 kilometers to the southwest of Jejudo, two uninhabited islands have been discovered for the first time. The man who discovered them is Han Gwang-seop (\u97d3\u5149\u71ee), who lives in Jeju Province. On the 15th he submitted an application for a permit to occupy waters on the open seas.\nThe two islands are 177.6 kilometers southwest of our southernmost island of Marado (\ub9c8\ub77c\ub3c4) at 32\u00ba 10' N and 125\u00ba E in the East China Sea. They are just small, rocky islands. The area of one is 5.2 million sq. meters, and the area of the other is 3.92 million sq. meters.\nMr. Han has named the islands \"Parangseo\" (\ud30c\ub791\uc11c) and \"Harangseo\" (\ud558\ub791\uc11c). On sea charts they are listed as a reef.\nA group of Koreans who referred to themselves as the Patriotic Old Men's Association (\u6182\u570b\u8001\u4eba\u6703), headquarted in Seoul, Korea, sent a 6-page petition letter dated August 5, 1948 to General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP), claiming Korean sovereignty over \"Docksom,\" Ulleungdo, Tsushma, and \"Parang\" Islands. The letter was apparently received by or transferred to the US Political Adviser for Japan because carbon copies were made and sent to the US Representative in Seoul with a September 16 cover letter explaining the Korea petition. The cover letter and the 6-page Korean petition are posted below.\nNotice in their claim for \"Docksum\" (Liancourt Rocks) that they wrote that the Korean name meant \"pot island\" and that it was given that name because it looked like a pot. Apparently, the Patriotic Old Men never saw Liancourt Rocks because they look nothing like a pot. The name \"Dokdo\" (\u7368\u5cf6) actually means \"Lonely Island.\"\nThe Patriotic Old Men seem to have thought Liancourt Rocks was a reference to either Ulleungdo or Ulleungdo's neighboring island of Jukdo (\u7af9\u5cf6), which is just two kilometers off Ulleungdo's east shore. Not only does Ulleungdo's neighboring island of Jukdo look more like a \"pot\" than Liancourt Rocks, the name \"Jukdo\" (\u7af9\u5cf6) uses the same Chinese characters as the Japanese name for Liancourt Rocks, \"Takeshima\" (\u7af9\u5cf6). The fact that the same Chinese characters were used for both islands is probably the source for the misunderstanding. The Patriotic Old Men must have thought the Japanese were trying to claim Ulleungdo and its neighboring of Jukdo.\nThe article claims that the Japanese had the MacArthur Line drawn to include Socotra Rock on the Japanese side, but I think it is possible that the Koreans simply assumed that from maps showing the MacArthur Line.\nNotice in the article below"

One of these goals looks at health and wellness. Ageing populations have become a crucial issue worldwide and this short monograph explores ageing and how the consequences of an ageing population may affect our health care system through the case study on Hong Kong's population.\nThe book looks at several critical health issues related to ageing. The elderly, particularly those with low socioeconomic status, rely more on the acute-centric care rather than primary care. The book suggests that secondary care service may only be effective to limited extent as a healthcare measure and an optimum health care system should be one that focuses on primary care. The authors put forth a compelling argument for disease prevention and screening schemes and explain how they are more cost-effective and beneficial to the society and the system.\nThis thoughtful book will provide beneficial insights into the relationship of ageing and sustainable development goals in the context of health and wellness for policy makers and healthcare professionals.\nBen Y.

        "passage": ", we reported that the AG rich in CQ compound lowers the total lipid, triglyceride, phospholipid, and cholesterol levels in animal model [15]. Although AG's effect on body weight in rats has been reported [15], no study has focused on the antiadipogenic effect of AG in vitro. Specific adipogenic signal genes were examined to elucidate the specific mechanism underlying the effect of AG. The present study considered the antiobesity and antiadipogenic effects of AG in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and mice.\n\nPlant Material and Preparation of the Extract.\nAG leaves from Ulleungdo Island, Republic of Korea, were dried and crushed for extraction. The dried material was refluxed with 70% EtOH for 6 h at 60 \u2218 C. The extract was filtered, concentrated under reduced pressure, and then freeze-dried to obtain a solid extract powder.\n\nCell\nCulture. The 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Life Technologies Inc., Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, 100 g/mL streptomycin, and 100 units/mL penicillin at 37 \u2218 C in 10% CO 2. The cells were grown to confluency in 10% calf serum/DMEM. Two days after the cells had reached confluency (day 0), they were stimulated with a methylisobutylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin (MDI) induction medium (DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), 1 m/mL dexamethasone, and 1 g/mL of insulin). Two days after stimulation with MDI (day 2), the medium was changed to an insulin medium (DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 g/mL of insulin). Two days later (day 4), the medium was changed to 10% FBS/DMEM. The cells were fed with 10% FBS/DMEM every 2 days. Full differentiation was achieved by day 8.\n\nOil Red O Staining.\nTo determine both adipogenic potential and fat accumulation, we stained the cells with oil red O (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). On day 8, the cultured cells were washed thrice with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) and then fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed 3 times more with PBS and stained with 0.5 g/mL oil red O for 15 min. After rinsing with PBS, we captured representative photomicrographs using a microscope and measured fat accumulation.\n\nAdipoRed\nAssay. 3T3-L1 cells were cultured in 6-well plates at a density of 3 \u00d7 10 5 cells per well and set up to differentiate in the presence and absence of AG. On day 2 and day 8 of differentiation, the cells were exposed with AdipoRed (Lonza, Houston, TX, USA), and intracellular triglyceride (TG) level was analyzed.\n\nLeptin\nAssay. For the periods indicated, 3T3-L1 cells were treated with AG or not. Conditioned media from the final 24 h of culture were collected. Leptin concentrations were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Mouse Leptin Assay Kit, Immuno-Biological Laboratories Co., Tokyo, Japan).\n\nReal-Time PCR Analysis.\nTotal RNA was isolated from the differentiated 3T3-L1 cells and epididymal adipose tissue by using Easy-Blue Reagent (Intron Biotechnology Inc., Gyoenggi-do, Republic of Korea) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then, total RNA qualification was performed with an Epoch micro-volume spectrophotometer system (BioTek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). An equal amount of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA with a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The program was set for 10 min of initiation at 25 \u2218 C, followed by 90 min of incubation at 50 \u2218 C and 5 min at 85 \u2218 C. Primers were obtained from Bioneer (Daejeon, Republic of Korea). All primer sequences and annealing temperatures are shown in Table 1. A Step One Plus Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with an SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) and primers (Bioneer, Seoul, Republic of Korea) was used to carry out a real-time PCR. The steps were as follows: 10 min at 95 \u2218 C, 40 cycles of 5 s at 95 \u2218 C, 45 s at 60 \u2218 C, a final melting curve of 15 s at 95 \u2218 C, 1 min at 60 \u2218 C, 15 s at 95 \u2218 C for tissues, or for cells, and 5 min followed by 35 repetitive thermal cycles (94 \u2218 C for 30 s, 60 \u2218 C for 30 s, and 72 \u2218 C for 30 s). Fold changes of gene expression were calculated using the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method (Applied Biosystems). The data were normalized for the initial control, GAPDH.\n\nWestern Blot\nAnalysis. The 3T3-L1 cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl 2, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture). Determination of the protein was carried out on Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by a transfer to PVDF membranes (EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA). Then, the membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% tween 20 (TBST) at room temperature for 1 h and incubated at 4 \u2218 C overnight with 1 : 1000 dilutions of primary antibodies. The following day, the membranes were washed with TBST 3 times for 10 min each and made to react with 1 : 2500\n\nAnimal Experiments.\nMale C57BL/6J mice, weighing 15-17 g at an age of 3-4 weeks, were purchased from Daehan Biolink (DaeJeon, Republic of Korea). They were housed (5 mice/cage) under a 12 h light-dark cycle, at 23 \u00b1 2 \u2218 C, and a relative humidity of 55% \u00b1 10%, under conditions that followed the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals; they were allowed diet and water ad libitum. After 1 week of acclimation, 40 mice were divided randomly and equally into 4 groups of 10 each. Mice in group 1 (CON) were fed standard chow and those in group 2 (HFD) a HFD (40% fat). group 3 (AG1) consisted of mice fed with the same HFD, which included 1% AG extract (1% w/w in HFD), and group 4 (AG5) consisted of mice fed HFD with 5% added AG extract (5% w/w in HFD). Mice were fed experimental diet for 10 weeks. Body weight was recorded weekly. After an overnight fast at the end of the experimental period, tissue collection was performed. The animals were sacrificed by cervical spine dislocation and the livers, epididymal, retroperitoneal and total fat pads were dissected, weighed immediately, and frozen at \u221280 \u2218 C.\n\nAG-Mediated Inhibition of Adipogenesis in Preadipocytes.\nTo determine whether AG has an antiobesity effect, we carried out adipocyte differentiation using 3T3-L1 cells, both in the presence and the absence of AG. After 8 days, oil red O was added to the cultured cells, and fat accumulation and intracellular triglyceride levels were analyzed. Troglitazone, an antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory drug [16], was used as a positive control for the inhibition of fat accumulation. As shown in Figure 1, the number and size of cytosolic lipid droplets markedly decreased (Figure 1(a)), and reduction in fat accumulation, dependent on concentration, was observed (Figure 1(b)). Intracellular TG was analyzed with the AdipoRed assay. On day 2, the accumulation of TG in the differentiated cells was similar to that in the AG-treated cells (Figure 1(c)). After 8 days, the AG-treated differentiated cells showed significantly lower TG levels, exhibiting a dosedependent change, than those in the untreated differentiated cells (Figure 1(d)). To assess cellular capacity to produce adipocyte-derived hormones, we monitored the expression of leptin, a well-documented hormone with anti-diabetic properties, in cells of adipocyte lineage. Significant suppression of leptin protein secretion was observed in 3T3-L1 cells by the treatment with AG (Figure 1(e)). Cells treated with AG were harvested at day 8, and the expressions of genes were analyzed by real-time PCR. Each bar represents the mean \u00b1 SEM of triplicate PCR reactions, and mRNA samples were obtained from experimental adipocyte cells. # < 0.05 versus ND group. * < 0.05 versus CON group, * * < 0.01 versus CON group, and * * * < 0.001 versus CON group.\n\nAG Regulation of the Expression of Adipogenic\n8-day AG treatment of cells reduced the mRNA expression of PPAR, C/EBP, SREBP1c, and LXR ( Figure 2).\n\nAG-Mediated Reduction of Body Weight, Visceral Epididymal, Retroperitoneal, and Total Fat-Pad Weights, and Liver\nWeight in HFD-Induced Obese Mice.

        "passage": " Heyer, 1962.<|endoftext|>The following is an 1874 Japanese map of Joseon Korea called, \u201cDetailed Map of the Country of Joseon\u201d (\u671d\u9bae\u570b\u7d30\u898b\u5168\u56f3).\nThe map shows Usando (\u4e8e\u5c71\u5cf6) as a small island to the south of Ulleungdo (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6). At the time, Korean maps were showing Usando as Ulleungdo\u2019s neighboring island of Jukdo, which is 2.2 kilometers off Ulleungdo\u2019s east shore, so that means that this map did not reflect the Korean preception of Ulleungdo at the time. In other words, the Japanese had an outdated map of Ulleungdo in 1874.\nThe following is text that was written at the bottom of the map and explained certain aspects of it.\nOne aspect the text explained was the island of Ulleungdo (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6). Here is a cutout of the section describing Ulleungdo.\nUlleungdo (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6), also known as Isotakeshima (\u5f13\u5d69\u5cf6 \u2013 \u30a4\u30bd\u30c0\u30b1\u5cf6), is part of Gangwon Province. It is located in the sea 1,000 ri from Samcheok (\u4e09\u965f). It has a circumference of 940 to 950 ri.\nUlleungdo (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6), also known as Isotakeshima (\u5f13\u5d69\u5cf6 \u2013 \u30a4\u30bd\u30c0\u30b1\u5cf6), is part of Gangwon Province. It is located in the sea 1,000 ri from Samcheok (\u4e09\u965f), and has a circumference of approximately 140 to 150 ri.\nThe above translation makes much more sense since the circumference of Ulleungdo was approximately 140 to 150 ri. At any rate, the above map is evidence that, in 1874, Japan knew that Usando was a neighboring island of Ulleungdo, but still did not know the exact location.\nAt any rate, the above map is evidence that, in 1874, Japan knew that Usando was a neighboring island of Ulleungdo, but still did not know the exact location.\nUTSURYO-TO Island(\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6), otherwise known as ISOMOYA-TO Island(\u5f13\u5d69\u5cf6), is an island attached to KOGENDO(\u6c5f\u539f\u9053). It is located 1000 ri(\u5343\u91cc) away across the sea from SANSYO(\u4e09\u6e09) and its perimeter is 945 ri(945\u91cc).\nI am not sure if \u201cISOMOYA-TO\u201d is correct because the third character of Kana letters written between lines is blurred.\nCaptitalized words show that they are read in Japanese.\nI think \u4e5d\u767e\u56db\u4e94\u5341\u91cc should be 940~950 ri, not 945 ri.\nThanks Madboots, Ponta, & Pacifist.\nI am curious about the name \u5f13\u5d69\u5cf6, which also appears on this 1806 Japanese map of Korea. Is it possible that \u5f13\u5d69\u5cf6 could have been another way to write Usando (\u4e8e\u5c71\u5cf6), which literally means \u201chigh mountain island\u201d?\nHe wrote \u201c\u5f13\u5d69 \u30a4\u30bd\u30c0\u30b1\u201don a mountain in Ullungdo.\nYes, I used to assume that the \u201cTakeshima\u201d in Isotakeshima was referring to \u201cBamboo Island,\u201d but the Chinese character, \u5d69, suggest that it was referring to the \u201ctall mountain\u201d (\u5d69 = tall mountain) on Ulleungdo. That is why I am wondering if the name \u201cIsotakeshima\u201d might have evolved from \u201cUsando\u201d (\u4e8e\u5c71\u5cf6), which also means \u201cTall Mountain Island\u201d?\ngroup in America, whose aim is empowerment of Japanese Americans.\nJPCL is the first Japanese group in America that publicly supports such a resolution.\nand on the Japanese government to correct its historic texts.\nresolution early next month.\nReally? What is JPCL?\nI can\u2019t believe this. Can someone confirm about this news?\nGerry again what you have is a Japanese copy of a Korean map. It\u2019s a huge error of yours to automatically assume the territorial perceptions of \u201cthe Japanese\u201d on maps made by other countries.\nJapanese cartographers copied maps from all countries. At this time in the 19th Century Japanese mappers were citing maps from all around the world. So to take one map from historical archives and say \u201cthe Japanese thought\u2026\u201d is not a very logical approach to history.\nThe Japanese mappers had confused perception of this region as whole. However for the most part their belief was that two islands existed in the East Sea. The Japanese were placing Dokdo (Matsushima) and Ulleungdo (Takeshima) all over the East Sea during this time. The position of the islands was usually wrong and the form was almost never correct.\nWhat happened to the Japanese in 1840 gives us insight as to how foreign maps affected Japanese maps. The first Europeans mapped Ulleungdo too far West and named it Argonaut later it was mapped correctly and named Dagelet. This created two \u201cUlleungdo\u2019s\u201d in the East Sea, the Westerly island was non-existent (Argonaut) and the Eastern (Dagelet) was correctly located.\nSee this European map.\nFrom there Japanese mapmakers copied the European maps and blindly drew \u201ctwo islands\u201d Ulleungdo and Dokdo more Westerly. Note the position and shape of this Japanese map is exactly the same as the European map above.\nWhen Seibold assigned the name Takeshima to the non-existent \u201cArgonaut\u201d and Matsushima to Dagelet the Japanese began to perceive Ulleungdo and Dokdo much farther West.\nIt is possible that \u5f13\u5d69 means a mound like an arch.\nmadboots Good job!!\nI don\u2019t know about the organization, but there are Japanese who support the resolution.\nI think it would be wired if people of the democratic country unanimously agree on political issue, though there are such countries in East Asia.\nThis could also be said of Korean maps. When the Japanese viewed Korean maps of the East Sea, they again saw two islands in the East Sea. At a glance they could see that the scale of these maps was off. Ulleungdo was much to close to the Korean mainland for these maps to be of accurate scale, so they too considered Usando to be Matsushima. The Japanese government had very little information of the islands directly next to Ulleungdo, only until 1880 did the Japanese government accurately record the existence of Ulleungdo\u2019s \u201cneighbour islands.\nThus during the investigation into Takeshima around 1878 the Japanese compared Korean maps and documents and some made the natural conclusion that Usando was Matsushima (Dokdo) This makes sense when you compare the Korean maps to Japanese maps.\nNot only that when Anyongbok protested Japanese fishing on Ulleungdo he clearly stated \u201cJasando (Usando) was Matsushima (Dokdo)\u201d This incident would leave an indelible impression on the territorial perceptions of both Koreans and Japanese for centuries thereafter.\nOn page 5 of the Anyongbok report found in the archives of the Murakawa family of Shimane Prefecture it was stated \u201cJasando is Matsushima\u201d It was said to be in the middle of the North Sea and part of Kangwan Province.\nTo the Japanese this would have only meant one island-Dokdo. This is because in 1667 the Japanese document Onshu-shicho-goki also recorded and two islands in the North Sea called Takeshima and Matushima.\nThe Japanese viewed many maps and documents to arrive at a general consensus about the East Sea, the most basic principle they relied on was two islands existed in the east sea and they followed this rule often with blind conviction.\nToadface, you have yet to show me even one Korean or Japanese map that shows \u201cUsando\u201d as Liancourt Rocks. I, on the other hand, have shown you several Korean and Japanese maps that show \u201cUsando\u201d as a neighboring island of Ulleungdo.\n\u5d69(Kasa) means height and size of piled thing, or Volume, capacity, and weight.\nGenerally, it doesn\u2019t use it to describe a huge thing.\nWhen the big mountain and the ranging of it are described, \u5cb3 or \u5dbd is handled.\nThough I do not percice an English nuance easily,bulkness(ly) or thik(ly) or luxuriant(ly) may have same nuance.\n\u5f13(yumi) means bow.\nSo, The outline of the island may be seen like thick, tall a little, arc of the bended bow from a distance.\nThis is only a my imagination.\nMaybe the Korean concept of \u5d69 is different from the Japanese?\nNot only that when Anyongbok protested Japanese fishing on Ulleungdo he clearly stated \u201cJasando (Usando) was Matsushima (Dokdo)\u201d.\nThe word in the second parentheses is only your imagination and not right.\nNot only that when Anyongbok protested Japanese fishing on Ulleungdo he clearly stated \u201c"
