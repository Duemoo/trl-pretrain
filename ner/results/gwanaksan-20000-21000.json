Cultural sites, such as Deoksugung Palace, the Seoul Museum of Art, and Jeongdong Theater are also available for visitors to enjoy.\nThe ginkgo trees along Itaewon-ro (from Samgakji Station to Noksapyeong Station) are breathtaking, while trail-goers can enjoy exotic dining at the trendy Gyeongnidan-gil or Haebangchon after a stroll amid the foliage.\nThe autumn leaves that cut through Cheonggyecheon Stream and the city are beautiful. It\u2019s adjoined by the Gwanghwamun Gate, Dongdaemun Gate, and the Seoul Folk Flea Market located in Sinseol-dong. It makes an excellent outing and shopping destination.\nNeedless to say, the Namsan North Trail is another landmark trail in/of the city, as well as a foliage trail draped in the foliage of cherry blossoms. Its pedestrian-friendly, traffic-free roadway allows people to appreciate the autumn leaves in leisure.\nSeoul Forest connects with the Hangang River, with visitors fully able to enjoy the spirit of the deep forest while walking along an autumn scenery colored in ginkgo trees tinged with yellow.\nThe Yangjae Citizen\u2019s Forest and the neighboring Culture and Arts Park demonstrate their impressive metasequoia foliage trails.\nThe Songpanaru Neighborhood Park (Seokchon Lake) also has beautiful, autumn cherry blossoms, with Lotte World just a few steps away to make for a great weekend outing with the children.\n\u25cb Gwanaksan Mountain is one of the locations in Seoul where autumn leaves reach their peak the earliest, and the 1 km section at the entrance of Gwanaksan Mountain, nearby the main entrance of Seoul National University, is a broad trail providing easy access for wheelchairs and strollers.

How quickly there is a return to normal or \u2013 an expression I really cannot abide, but which is used a great deal \u2013 a \u2018new normal\u2019 is very hard to predict. Newspapers, magazine and social media are full of columnists and opinion writers sharing their predictions of what the future holds. Much of it is unreliable, some outright nonsense. The Roman poet Horace had a very different perspective; \u201cCarpe diem, quam minimum credula postero,\u201d he wrote (\u201cSeize the day, put no trust in the future\u201d). In other words, try not to waste time worrying about the future (though it is easier said than done, even in Latin!) and concentrate on what needs to be done today.\nI have spent the last five months speaking and listening extensively to Northampton businesses, business groups, charities and community groups about the challenges that they face.\nI want to especially mention and thank the critical work of the Reverend Haydon Spenceley and his staff and volunteers of the Weston Favell Food Bank who have been working extraordinarily hard under the most difficult of circumstances to make sure that those people and families in crisis have the food and support they need. They are living proof of the meaning of the word community.\nSome organisations will weather the oncoming storm relatively well, others not so well. The ones who have been evolving and adapting are the ones best placed to pull through this.\nNorthamptonshire Police has been using the lockdown time wisely. It has been quietly rebuilding and strengthening its systems and operations. Its major crime squad has seriously disrupted major drugs gangs in the county by hitting them when they were weak. Six major drug cartel members are currently sharing 124 years of prison time because of determined work by the police. Their intelligence backlog has been cleared and they are on the front foot in terms of their Force performance indicators. For example, they now sit in the top performing quartile of Criminal Justice Outcomes. They now have more police officers than in 2010 and by 2023 they will have 526 more officers to add to that.\nLocal public services like health and local government are also cooperating like never before. Their relationships are closer, deeper and better as a result of this crisis and this bodes well for the deep integration work taking place between the local NHS and Adult Social Care.\nOur retail businesses have been adapting and upping their game by investing in online selling facilities to mitigate their physical retail sales loss and getting to grips with the power of social media to advertise. Northampton Forward is the town\u2019s umbrella organisation seeking to create a bright future for a re-imagined Northampton and has bids into Government to help achieve that; attending their meetings and providing a Parliamentary perspective has helped me support those efforts. Also, in what proved to be a timely event, Google came to Northampton pre-lockdown to provide top tips for our smaller retail businesses to augment their sales with digital techniques that are now ever more critical; again, I was pleased to attend and meet many of those taking part.\nI was very worried about the Royal and Derngate Theatre. The theatre has been in existence since 1884 and has been facing the perfect storm of vulnerability. The Arts Council, a key contributor for the Royal and Derngate, had been burning through their reserves to support theatres up and down the country and was on the point of financial exhaustion when the Government announced their \u00a31.6 billion fiscal rescue plan, just in the nick of time.\nThe Royal and Derngate was not the only cultural and heritage organisation facing financial oblivion. Delapre Abbey and the 78 Derngate museum were also on the cliff edge of existence. Thankfully, they now all have a fighting chance with the cultural and heritage rescue package.\nThe heritage package was just part of the \u00a330 billion array of support packages announced by the Chancellor. In these extraordinary times the Government has been deploying extraordinary support for the country. In normal times it would go against the economic and political instincts of many, including myself, and even in a time of zero and even negative world financial market interest rates the principal sum will have to be repaid at some stage and those rates will not be this low forever. Was it the right call? It seems so in the once in lifetime situation we are facing and with"

Keep up the good work and thank you so much.\nAwesome, thanks Fikri, glad you enjoyed it. Cheers!\nThanks for writing this blog, you have provided very detailed information and it was very helpful.\nCheers RaKee, glad to hear it!\nThank you for this really useful guide! I just hiked the Sadang trail today and because I didn\u2019t have any WiFi or data, I was reliant on your photos to help me find the way. Super fun and I loved climbing up all the rocks. Thanks again!\nCheers Anna, the Sadang route is such a great hike, glad you enjoyed it!\nHi Simon, thanks for that wonderful description. I really want to hike the Sadang route, do you think it would be safe to hike it alone? When I hiked up Samseongsan from Anyang, I was shocked by how little trail markings there were. I sort of got lost and climbed up unsecured rocks that did not seem like they were part of the official trail. I like rock climbing, but I\u2019d like to avoid getting lost if possible, haha. Is the trail marked well?\nAnd another question: I want to see the sunrise over Seoul, do you know a good spot to do that now in Summer? You said something about hiking only part of Sadang trail up to a viewpoint after some metal stairs. You think I would be able to see the sunrise from there? And is there some rock climbing prior to those stairs? I have good head lamps, so I am not worried about some simple hiking, but rocks are out of the question in the dark, I suppose. Thank you!\nHi Anna, sorry for the slow reply, blogging\u2019s on the backburner a bit due to the pandemic.\nI\u2019ve never done a sunrise hike in Seoul, but if I did I think Gwanaksan from Sadang would be the one I\u2019d go for. The viewpoint at the top of the steps would be a nice sunrise spot, sure \u2013 I\u2019ve been up there for sunset, as you can see in the pics.\nThe main trails are generally very obvious (though I\u2019ve checked out a couple of more minor ones and those are much rougher) and well signed, but if you look at the 18th image on this page you can see the broken signpost \u2013 they should\u2019ve fixed it by now, but if not you could get thrown off course there so be careful with that.\nIf you turn left at that signpost, in front of you is the rock scramble shown in the next image (19th down from the top) with the steps & flag at the top of the rocks. That\u2019s the main rock scramble until the final summit section, so take a look at the rocks in that pic and decide if you\u2019re happy to tackle those in the dark and base your decision on that.<|endoftext|>Last year Disney began active development of a film tenuously connected to the Disneyland Matterhorn ride.

Either the reputation mechanic should be applied game-wide or it should be discarded altogether.\nThis is the logic behind \"zero tolerance\" policies and other nonsensical behaviors where people substitute strict enforcement of one-size-fits-all rules for actual intelligence and good judgement. It's certainly easier to implement all-or-nothing rules, but easier is not synonymous with better. Carefully managed exceptions make almost any rule better when looking at real world outcomes.\nThere are 9 grey hexes on the map. I specifically chose them because they're rare and avoidable, and could not become the exception that devoured the rule. The only way 9 FFA hexes could transform the norm would be if a major fraction of the population was clustering into those hexes, presumably because they're having fun there.\nI would go so far as to say that the point of having a reputation system that punishes PvP in a game that desires to use PvP as it's primary content is to have exceptions for meaningful cases.\nI think a tiny fraction of the map with highly valuable resources in comparison to the rest of the map constitute an area where all PvP is meaningful, so the lack of a rep hit makes perfect sense.\nWhen you have areas people know they can go to to enjoy a high probability of PvP and get great loot, that is a mechanic which provides a carrot to engage in meaningful PvP against targets who know they are putting themselves in danger, as opposed to meaningless PvP against random targets.\nYour arguments for FFA PvP in these hexes make no sense. A person will have to invest heavily to be able to gather these resources whereas you think you get to just take your PvP skills and attack without loss? This is not meaningful in the way the system has been described to us. It is an attempt to veil the desire to be a Murderhobo. There will be plenty of fighting and murders over these resources as is and the investment in skills to gather these resources should not mean your just everyone's victim. You want meaningful FFA mechanics build it into player settlements of the low reps where greedy high reps might want to make money but need large guard forces not to just be more cash in the bandits pocket. Go one step further and let the worst types in game align themselves with pve enemy types and get flagged as allied to those types. This would make them dynamic"
