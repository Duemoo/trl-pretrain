It points out that most of the interpretations except the stochastic interpretation are not affected by this theorem. According to this theorem, any viable stochastic theory of quantum mechanics should be a stochastic hidden variable theory, as is shown by Montina\uff07s results. Notwithstanding this, the \u03c8epistemic approach is still possible if we follow Einstein\uff07s idea not to accept the ontological model of quantum mechanics.<|endoftext|>Whenever I visit Hong Kong, I like to take one of the ferries to an outlying island. Cheng Chau is just 30 minutes away and the small harbor still has photogenic Chinese ships. The few seafood restaurants only use ingredients that are live, from finfish to scallops, crabs to spiny lobsters. It is possible to find live seafood locally, although not of this abundant variety.\nThe best selection is at William Ho\u2019s (3524 N. Oakland Ave.). Many patrons whisk through the lobby to the buffet tables in search of live lobsters, tilapia and Dungeness crabs, all of which are very fresh and lively. When Ho\u2019s first stocked live seafood, the choices also included geo-duck clam, eel and abalone. Those options may be gone, but this is still a top pick for lobster. It\u2019s effortless to eat: No shell cracking is required, and chopsticks will suffice.\nWhenever I visit Hong Kong, I can never understand...\nWhenever I visit Hong Kong, I can never understand what they are saying.\nWhenever I visit Hong Kong, I like to take a ricks...\nWhenever I visit Hong Kong, I like to take a rickshaw to The Canny Man down in the Wan Chai district.

Thank you for unburnt cookies. Thank you for birds that take cat naps in the crepe myrtle.\"\nSome days it's hard to get beyond the aggravations. The demands of our jobs. The endless housework. Unnecessary rudeness. Apathy. Politics. Cruelty. It's easy to be overwhelmed and blind to the soft spoken sweetness of each and every day.\nI'm starting a new project. I've been playing with how to proceed for sometime and the more I ponder the more excited I become. Winter's melancholy has gone on long enough and I'm ready to take a photo walk through Shannon's gratitude journal. There is something about the soft morning light through the bedroom window that touches me, allows me to see simple things in a special way. So I started there...\nAs I play with the idea of a series of still life moments, full of wonderful \"things\" that make our hearts sing, I realize how many times someone, especially on Facebook, will mention one of their gratitude moments and I resonate with them. I smile because they smile.\nBefore I embark on this new adventure....April 5, Shannon's 37th birthday, I invite you to share with me what makes you smile.

        "passage": ", [the slices] stay on the whole fish until your order comes in.\" And a made-to-order model enables FreshDirect to control costs by minimizing inventory. \"We've cut a huge amount of time out of the supply chain because we don't have to stock as much as a normal store,\" says McGowan.\nSince it opened its doors in 2002, $200-million Sprouts Farmers Market based in Phoenix has specialized in the \"farmer's market niche,\" touting high-quality food at affordable prices. Sprouts' 19 locations use an open store design, with low aisles and farm-fresh and organic products located in bins at the center of stores. A strong emphasis on customer service has made the core technology challenge one of ensuring that \"what's on the shelf satisfies the demand,\" says Doug Sanders, senior VP and COO.\nSo Sprouts uses Retalix Ltd.'s Category Analyzer, an inventory management application that provides its ordering managers with information on which products are selling and which need to be ordered, as well as Retalix HQ, which feeds current product pricing and other information to cash registers and handhelds. Now managers can forecast what Sprouts anticipates selling so vendors \"can get us the items we need,\" says Sanders. By the end of next year, Sanders hopes to make inventory information available to suppliers through Sprouts' Web-based portal. That way, Sprouts ordering managers and suppliers can coordinate product ordering online. In the meantime, managers can access some inventory and pricing data through the portal.\nBetter information does more than create operational efficiency; it also helps improve customer service. At FreshDirect, business intelligence is central to that goal, says McGowan. For example, in 2006, when batches of California spinach were discovered to contain the E. coli virus, FreshDirect's systems could alert customers who had ordered the affected crop and reassure those who had ordered spinach from unaffected regions. And soon the company plans to provide customer-specific screen views to reflect customer tastes; a vegetarian customer, for example, shouldn't have to view the virtual meat aisle, but he should see recipes that call for the products he buys, says McGowan.\nAt Sprouts, centralized data and Web-based initiatives are also helping with thorny workforce issues. According to the industry research group Food Marketing Institute, in 2006 average turnover for the labor-intensive grocery industry was 42%, so companies are turning to technology to stay on top of hiring, payroll and benefits.\nOver the past eight months, Sprouts has begun deploying workforce management technologies from Unicru/Kronos Inc. to automate payroll entry and manage information for its 1,500 employees. And because this employee time and attendance data is centralized, it streamlines the process of transferring employees between Sprouts' 19 stores, says Sanders. Ultimately, employees will be able to choose benefits online and view paycheck information and vacation time.\nOnline capabilities also help with hiring. If an applicant applies online for a deli manager position at a store with no openings, the website makes his information available to other locations with open positions. All these online tools increase staff access to information, enabling Sprouts to hire and retain a \"better-quality employee,\" says Sanders.\nAt Scarborough, Maine-based Hannaford Bros. Co., deploying Lawson Software's Web-based payroll and benefits system has helped lower costs and minimize turnover for its 25,000-strong workforce. \"We had people on the books who were still receiving medical coverage weeks after they had been terminated,\" says Jon Doody, team leader of HR and payroll at Hannaford. Paycheck errors had to be fixed retroactively. Now managers at its 158 stores no longer have to fax changes to the payroll department; they can enter this data online, which allows Hannaford to save $125,000 annually by streamlining administrative tasks and reducing paper. Since payroll administrators devote less time to data entry, their position has become \"more strategic,\" says Doody. That has increased payroll employees' job satisfaction and, combined with Lawson's self-service options that allow all employees to enroll in benefits online, has helped reduce Hannaford's turnover from 59% to 47%.\nFor these retail groceries, upcoming IT projects aim to build on gained efficiency. FreshDirect is trying to find software that can provide its 400 delivery people with information on the most effective routes around the city. That's a tall order for any technology, notes McGowan, since it has to make sense of New York's myriad logistical challenges, including whether it makes more sense for delivery people to park two blocks from an apartment building and walk.\nAnd at Sprouts, Sanders hopes to move even more information online, providing vendors with immediate access to the company's inventory needs and employees with scheduling and payroll information.\nBut, says Sanders, with its plans to expand from 19 stores to 50 locations by 2010, Sprouts has chosen a path of incremental technology improvements so it can concentrate on growth. \"The focus right now is fundamentals: getting solid ordering and receiving and inventory controls in place. Then you can do all the other fun stuff.\"\nLauren Horwitz, former managing editor, production, for CIO Decisions, is now managing editor for TechTarget's Data Center Media Group.

It's a bit esoteric though, and you have to wonder how much the kids really got.\nA sizable hit last Christmas, this Hong Kong animated feature is obviously targeted at children. Aside from the cute character designs, My Life as McDull comes complete with merchandising and an extensive ancillary franchise. The animation is aided by obvious computer generated backgrounds, but it retains a charming hand-drawn look that's pleasing to the tykes. McDull is an animated pig. And he's cute.\nWith all that, it's a wonder that My Life as McDull turns out to have a rather existential theme and a narrative style that would do Hideaki Anno (of Neon Genesis Evangelion) proud. Massive voice-over from an adult McDull (voiced by Jan Lam) narrates this episodic tale of young McDull's experiences with hope and disappointment as he and his mother (voiced by Sandra Ng) struggle through their low-income lives.\nMcDull was born dimwitted despite his mother's prayers for a handsome, smart son. There's no Dad around, so Mom has to make do alone. Mom continually prays for McDull's luck and life to change. However, his desires are simple. He wants to go to the Maldives. He wants a turkey dinner for Christmas. He wants things that are beyond their means.\nThey really can't afford these things, but his mother tries to please him anyway. She gets him the turkey, but the leftovers drive him crazy. Instead of the Maldives, she takes McDull to The Peak and pretends it's the Maldives. In exchange, McDull can only give into his mother's wishes and attempt to make something of himself. He decides to train to become an Olympic level athlete like Hong Kong Olympian Li San-San. However, the trade he learns is Cheng Chau Bun Catching, which involves training heavily to snatch meat buns from large towers. Huh?\nIt's actually esoteric details like these that make the movie special. My Life as McDull is steeped in a realistic, actual representation of Hong Kong, from the Peak Tram to the Wellcome grocery stores. McDull and his mother may be animated pigs, but their lives are those of working class Hong Kong residents. They visit the market and the temple regularly. Getting to Central requires a trip on the bus, and getting to Cheng Chau means taking the ferry. Landmarks (like Times Square in Causeway Bay) and streets are made to be actual. The Bun Catching thing is based on an actual festival activity that once took place in Hong Kong. It's a charming, involving effect, especially for those who either live or have visited the region.\nFurthermore, McDull's life has large metaphorical implications that are quite obvious when you stop to take a look. Despite being dim-witted and below average, McDull struggles gamely to make something of himself. He wants to be true to his mother's love and remains positive in his goals. And even if he never seems to make it, there's something inspiring in his effort. That he's an animated pig practicing bun-snatching kung-fu makes everything seem silly, but the sentiments behind it are not.\nThe stumbling block here is the self-referential storytelling that could leave most kids in the dust. Do any children out there really enjoy watching barely animated still frames with existential voiceover laid on top? The film's sentiments can prove quite charming and affecting, but when it comes out in existential voiceover, you would think that the kids would never catch it. The sounds and images speak to them, but the film's voice ultimately might not.<|endoftext|>If you're looking for compassionate, high-quality dental care, you've found Twin City Dental.

He received his BA from Franciscan University in 1989. Originally planning a career in business, his interest in philosophy was awakened through the discovery of Dietrich von Hildebrand's thought in the areas of love, marriage and ethics. After graduating from Franciscan, he and his wife, Katie, studied together at the International Academy of Philosophy under Josef Seifert, John Crosby and Rocco Buttiglione, deepening their interest in personalist philosophy, especially as it is found in the work of such thinkers as von Hildebrand, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, John Henry Newman and Karol Wojtyla. He received his doctorate in 2000, and is preparing his dissertation on von Hildebrand's analysis of moral wrong-doing for publication. He has taught courses at Franciscan University, the International Theological Institute in Gaming, Austria, and at St. John's Seminary in s'Hertogenbosch, Netherlands. He is currently Assistant Professor and Chairman of Philosophy at Ave Maria University, where he has been teaching since 2000. His appreciation for and dedication to von Hildebrand's legacy continues to grow, in part through close friendship and intellectual collaboration with von Hildebrand's widow, Alice von Hildebrand, who spends summers in New Hampshire with the van Schaijiks and their five children.<|endoftext|>For nearly four weeks, Alfred Boonkong, Christopher John and I went on mission to the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui (HKSKH), the Province of the Anglican Communion in Hong Kong and Macau. This was my first trip outside of Europe and began with my first ever long-haul flight, which ran incredibly smoothly, with us all arriving from our various locations on Thursday 21st April. As I was the first to arrive I was instantly taken for my first Hong Kong food: a bread-meal with sock tea, which was lovely and refreshing after hitting the heat and humidity that knocked me as much as the jetlag, but also began my most lasting memory of HKSKH, a wonderful hospitality and generosity centred around food, tea and fellowship.\nOur time was mainly divided between two activities; travelling around the Province, meeting people and learning about life in Hong Kong and Macau; and teaching through retreats, quiet days and lectures about Franciscan Spirituality and the Religious Life. We discovered an incredibly welcoming and generous culture, full of spirituality and the love of God, with many wonderful blessings. The churches are packed with both young and old, men and women, speaking a cacophony of languages: English, Cantonese, Mandarin, Tagalog and several others.\nWe were mainly based at Ming Hua Theological College in the Central area of Victoria Island, where we lived alongside the postulants, those training for ordination, always aware of the constant nightlife opposite us in Lan Kwai Fong, the bar and clubbing district. Living alongside the postulants was a brilliant experience and helped me to experience more of the local life, being told where was good for shopping and to just sit and people watch with a cup of coffee.\nWe also spent time on Cheng Chau, an island about 30 minutes from Victoria Island and famed for its luscious mango snacks. This is where the Province keeps a small retreat house among beautiful and awe-inspiring scenery, with sea eagles flying overhead and following the fishing boats out to sea. Here we led two retreats on the life of Francis and made some delightful new friends. We also visited a wonderful"
