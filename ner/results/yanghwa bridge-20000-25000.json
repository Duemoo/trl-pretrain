Though his parents were initially against him becoming a singer, Daesung pursued his passion and successfully passed his audition at YG Entertainment. He debuted with BIGBANG on August 19, 2006 alongside Taeyang, G-Dragon, T.O.P, and Seungri.\nSoon after his debut with BIGBANG Daesung developed vocal chord nodules, which led him to struggle with his voice and develop stage fright. With the help of then-label mate Gummy, who suffered the same condition, Daesung eventually overcame his condition. Along with various group activities with BIGBANG, Daesung also pursued a solo career, interestingly enough, as a trot singer. He released his first trot single, \"Look at Me, Gwisoon\" in 2008 followed by \"Big Hit\" in 2009.\nIn August 2009, Daesung was injured in a car accident while returning to Seoul from filming a reality show. The accident occurred when the van hit the guard rail and skidded in the pouring rain. Daesung, who was sitting in the passenger seat, suffered a broken nose, a back injury, and sustained minor contusions on his arms and legs. Daesung was fully covered by October 2009, and rejoined BIGBANG for promotions starting then.\nOn May 31, 2011, Daesung was involved in another car accident, this time while at the wheel. The accident occurred while Daesung was driving home at approximately 1:30am one night. An intoxicated motorcyclist crashed his bike on Yanghwa Bridge, and while the car immediately in front of Daesung swerved to avoid the man laying in the street, Daesung did not have time to react and ran over him and hit a parked taxi that had seen him and pulled over. The motorcyclist had a high blood-alcohol content level of 0.18, likely the cause of his crash. For some time time it was unsure as to whether or not he was already dead when Daesung hit him. However, after a long period of deliberation and an extensive autopsy, forensic specialists found that the motorcyclist was indeed alive before Daesung hit him, and that Daesung was responsible for his death. Despite this, the investigation cleared Daesung of all charges, finding that the accident was not his fault as he was not intoxicated, though he was speeding.\nFollowing the accident, Daesung remained underground for 6 months, making no appearances and releasing no new material. He made his first public appearance at the MTV European Music Awards in November 2011, and made a comeback with BIGBANG in March 2012 with their new mini album, Alive.\nDaesung released his first Japanese solo album in February 2013, and has been consistently successful in Japan since. He has released 3 solo albums (two of which peaked at #1 on the Oricon chart) and headlined multiple Japanese tours as a solo artist over the past three years.<|endoftext|>Lapayre, J. C.\nWe describe a new Watermarking system of medical information security and terminal mobile phone adaptation for PocketNeuro project. The later term refers to a Project created for the service of neurological diseases. It consists of transmitting information about patients \\\"Desk of Patients\\\" to a doctor\\'s mobile phone when he is visiting or examining his patient. This system is capable of embedding medical information inside diagnostic images for security purposes. Our system applies JPEG Compression to Watermarked images to adapt them to the doctor\\'s mobile phone. Experiments performed on a database of 30-256x256 pixel-sized neuronal images show that our Watermarking scheme for image security is robust against JPEG Compression. For the purpose of increasing the image Watermarking robustness against attacks for an image transmission and to perform a large data payload, we encode with Turbo-Code image-embedded bits information. Fidelity is improved by incorporation of the Relative Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (RPSNR) as a perceptual metric to measure image degradation.<|endoftext|>In broad terms, what was it you were looking for today?\nWho do you best represent?\nWhat type of land do you manage?\nAny others or a mixture?\nFeralScan is our interlinked community website and Smartphone App that allows you to map sightings of pest animals and record the problems they are causing in your local area.\nFeralScan can be used by farmers, community groups, pest controllers, local government, catchment groups and individuals managing pest animals and their impacts.\nFeralScan is a free resource that can be used by anyone to record pest animal activity, evidence of pests, pest damage, and control actions.

It can be an asset or perhaps the auto that you get. Various other lenders might provide you an unsecured loan. Here the danger variable is high so it is supplied at a higher price of passion. However as a result of high competitors a customer can even discuss the price of rate of interest.\nLow-cost auto loans are offered at a reasonably reduced rate of interest allowing you to pay for car.\nget a long term loan is a form of a secured loan where your automobile is to be promised as a safety. As the loan involves some danger, the loan providers choose to keep it as a secured loan. You have 2 settlement choices in this loan. The inexpensive automobile loans short-term and the affordable car loans long term. For the short-term loans the rate of interest is higher as compared to the Long Term Loans. You need to pay back the short term loans in about 5 years while for the long term loans you are provided a period of 20 years. The rates of interest can be decreased by certain quantities if you adopt the deposit.\nEconomic institutions such as financial institutions are currently making it so much easier for individuals to use cash money breakthroughs, some to the level of not going through history checks so they could lure people to apply for a loan.\nIf you yourself are not able to take treatment of the financial requirements of your organisation, unprotected business loans can be advantageous. If you are a business owner, you can find these loans at competitive interest rates by placing in some efforts. You need to decide your needs first and after that obtain any type of organisation loans.\nIf you can chat to your spouse and persuade her to allow go of gems or costly individual devices, see. This is most painful, however, one great means to obtain money in situation.\n, if you require rapid cash money these kinds of lending institutions can obtain you up to $1,500 within a pair hours.. They usually anticipate you to pay the money back over two pay periods, yet some companies give you as long as 100 days to pay the cash back. Make certain you select a business with payment terms you can deal with or you may want you had actually never ever taken out the loan.\nA larger deposit has the added advantage of eliminating lending institution\u2019s mortgage insurance coverage. Buyers who supply much less than a 20% deposit should pay loan provider\u2019s insurance. This can include hundreds of bucks to the regular monthly mortgage settlement.<|endoftext|>The Maybin Mission S2P (Streets to Peaks) program at Camp Grier provides year-round outdoor opportunities like backpacking, rock climbing, whitewater canoeing, and horseback riding to youth at no cost to their families.

Season 5 had some serious competition and although it didn\u2019t have the idol backing like the previous season, the popularity has been no joke. The Show Me The Money Concert Tour made a stop in Chicago and Los Angeles and was nothing short of AMAZING.\nEntering the Rosemont Theatre in Chicago, baseball caps filled the crowd at the 4,400 seated venue. Screams filled the room as promos for Crush\u2019s First Solo Tour teased the crowd as they anticipated the start of the show.\nAlthough Rosemont Theatre is all seated, everyone rose from their seats as soon as the concert started. SMTM riled up the crowd with an ode to old school hip-hop in a video graphic that featured New York-style graffiti and B-boying.\nThe crowd was already hyped but then Gil entered and accompanied Mad Clown in performing their special stage and the room filled with roars.\nAlthough Team Gil & Mad Clown were known for their awkward interactions this season, all of that was gone when they performed. Another video teaser started, and it became obvious that the teams would continue to perform in order of elimination from the show. That\u2019s when The Quiett entered the room. The crowd went wild as Illionaire has been quite popular in the U.S. for the past few years with their simple concept of providing no frills, hard hitting hip hop.\nIllionaire symbols filled the room and stayed up for Illionaire\u2019s full set of nine songs. Dok2 came on during the second song, \u201cBeverly Ills,\u201d which was obviously one of the crowd favorites.\nAlthough Dok2 and The Quiett had a longer set than most of the other performers, they kept their energy up and delivered their rhymes flawlessly. With their last song \u201c\uc5f0\uacb0\uace0\ub9ac (YGGR),\u201d they continuously built up the chorus which hyped up the crowd so much that the room was going insane! Thousands of voices repeated the lyrics until the duo left the stage.\nHe introduced his hit \u201cBeautiful\u201d by saying, \u201cDon\u2019t call me handsome boy, I\u2019m beautiful motherf**ker!\u201d and continued to do a four-song set.\nThe concert had been filled with hard hip-hop sounds all night and that\u2019s when Zion.T graced the stage with his soulful voice and popular song \u201c\ucff5 (Koong).\u201d The crowd went crazy as Zion.T hinted towards his three next songs and crowd kept guessing them right. Kush and C Jamm came back on for the SMTM hit \u201c Machine Gun\u201d before Zion. T finished with \u201cYanghwa Bridge.\u201d Of course Zion.T couldn\u2019t exit the stage without his signature bow.\nThe crowd had been anticipating the final team, AOMG, and when Gray hit the stage teasing the ladies with his \u201cSINGLE\u201d shirt and the whole room filled with screams. He performed \u201cDream Chaser\u201d and \u201cJust Do It\u201d solo before Simon D came on the stage.\nIt was obvious that Simon D was truly enjoying himself as he spoke English with the crowd. \u201cMusic is the one. Simon Dominic is the one.\u201d \u201cSimon Dominic is yours!\u201d and even made a fangirl\u2019s dream come true as he responded to her \u201cI love you\u201d with"

        "passage": "nae here offers a whole song himself making his passion for music known by his voice. You can feel his emotions while singing and its pretty much one of the best covers he have so far (in my preference).\nJungkook with Rap Monster (back then) released a pre-debut cover in 2012 of the song \"Like A Star\" by J.Cole. Hearing a young Jeongguk singing along in English with Namjoon here rapping sounds so nostalgic and impressive at the same time. With such an arrangement and sampling, in an early age, these two have already proven how talented they were - with so much potential and skills.\nDecember 29, 2015 - SoundCloud upload here. What I love about their collaboration is that they compliment each other's vocal ranges. Troye Sivan's song not only showcased Jungkook's versatility but as well as RM potential in singing and that he can deliver it clean and amazingly good.\nDecember 25, 2014 - A rendition of Justin Bieber's Mistletoe which lyrics were written and changed by Jimin himself. This is a pretty sweet and lovely carol from the two vocalists of the group. I find it impressive that Jungkook's voice can be this cute, relax and the whole change on the arrangement of the song despite sounds nice. It brings me back some childhood memories whenever I hear their giggling laugh at the end.\nYOU'RE MY with the full Vocal Line Jimin, Jin and V from original song of BIGBANG Taeyang.\nJeon Jungkook as BTS Main Vocalist and youngest member has participated the MBC Entertainment's THE KING OF MASK SINGER episode 71 last August 7, 2016 while singing to BIGBANG's \"If You\" and his beautiful live performance took over the crowd by a surprise. His interpretation of the song is amazing! I mean, he can even steal million of hearts just by his sweet voice even, to be very honest. On this link he was identified as the Golden Maknae.\nFrom the same episode of \"The King of Mask Singer\" Jungkook also sung with Lady Jane as Archery Girl. Their collaboration or rather 1on1 round was pretty impressive, hearing its studio version sounds beautiful and romantic. I'd be glad to hear him sing with other artists more, may it be female idols, I won't mind.\nAn original tweet from BTS Twitter page last September 24, 2014 was Jungkook's full recording or song cover or Zion.T's Yanghwa Bridge click here for the SoundCloud upload.\nOne year after, KBS World have Jungkook performed with Zion.T himself during the 2015 KBS Song Festival (held on Jan 23, 2016). It's a dream come true for the young artist to be able to collaborate with his sunbaenim/idol for such a beautiful and meaningful song on stage.\nYB - A Flying Butterfly stage by 20-year-old idols participated by Jungkook with his fellow K-artists of the same line in the industry (during 2016 KBS Song Festival). What I love on this stage? Well, BTS Maknae slays! His amazing intro brought a great impression of the whole show/presentation and successful!\nBTS members here on their bad boy vibes dancing along with Jungkook on his vocal cover of Rainism (Rain) as they performed old kpop songs. I just feel like including this on this blog as the last from the list because he technically brought them all powerfully. His breakdance was a definition of smooth, sexy and strong in combo. Center Jungkook definitely owned their stage in MMF2016!\n\u2022 Marry Me Jungkook here singing Jason Derulo's Marry Me on his own version from a clip/episode of American Hustle Life.\n\u2022 Dear No One during a Vlive broadcast with Taehyung.\n\u2022 See You Again Jungkook singing to Wiz Khalifa's in a video tweet.\n\u2022 Half Moon from a solo vlive broadcast clip where he was singing while on sound trip.\n\u2022 Contrail another beautiful song from Moon Moon which he sung during a live broadcast.\n\u2022 Boyfriend in a guesting for AfterSchoolClud, Jungkook sings part of Justin Bieber's Boyfriend while Jhope was beatboxing.\n\u2022 Eyes, Nose, Lips an M2 clip of Taehyung and Jungkook enjoying a videoke moment together, they chose Taeyang's hit song and harmonized well..\n\u2022 See Through young Kookie having a vocal practice during their pre-debut days.\n\u2022 Two Melodies during an audition for SOPA (School of Performing Arts) and he was 15 years old only when he shows off his talent and work his way to be an idol he is at the moment.\nJungkook is such a versatile singer, he's vocal range is impressive and it's stability is outstanding may it be live or recorded. He's been practicing for years and looking up to many idols while he makes a lot of cover songs from the hit ones or his favorites/influences. He practice English songs and even more so recording some pieces on his own style and discover his abilities. I'm not a vocal professional myself but I can say that Jungkook's has long run to take of his career because of his talent and determination. He has this passion one couldn't replicate.\nWe've been enjoying his cover songs for years and ready to face his anticipated mixtape. He is producing music, composing lyrics and directing his own videography/films (G.C.F.) - like what more of a surprise do we except from a Golden Maknae?\nThank you for making your way to the end of this blog. :hearts: What's your favorite cover song?\nWhen Jimin & Jungkook Collab..<|endoftext|>\u03a4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03c5\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03b1.\nCheck-out \u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2: 12:00 \u03bc.\u03bc.\n\u0395\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03b5\u03af\u03c3\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac - Above the age of 2.Above the age of 2.\n\u0391\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03cd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03ba\u03ac\u03c0\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 - Not indoors.
