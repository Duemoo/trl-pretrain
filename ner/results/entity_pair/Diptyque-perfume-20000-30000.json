        "passage": "An American in Paris searches for her signature scent.\nAll it takes is a whiff. A woman glides past, leaving behind a pungent trail of jasmine, rose, or some other sickening floral variety. A freshly-shaven man steps onto the metro and exposes the train car to his musky aftershave applied with a heavy hand. Spilt gasoline, cleaning products, aerosols, cigarette smoke\u2014the list of offenders is legion and a vague waft is sometimes all it takes to leave me inert with nausea, stinging eyes, and crippling headache tension. When it happens, the pain bubbles up ever so slightly until it\u2019s diffused broadly across my forehead or behind my eyes or in my sinuses.\nI wasn\u2019t always a migraine sufferer, though I knew I would invariably experience some version of what my mother suffered as I was growing up. Her headaches were chronic and resistant to over-the-counter pain relievers and holistic remedies. When they were mild, they felled her for hours; but when they were most severe, she\u2019d be out of commission for days and emerge in a migraine fog, a postdrome state that some liken to a wicked, mental hangover. Whether they were triggered by stress or scent, she\u2019d know they were coming by a visual aura that would appear. \u201cI would, literally, see paisley patterns in my eyes just prior to getting one,\u201d she told me.\nNo surprise, then, that triggers needed to be avoided at all costs and scented sprays or creams of any kind were strictly verboten. Like most young girls, I preferred the cloyingly sweet scents of vanilla, candy, sugar cane, caramel\u2014anything sweet enough to eat\u2014and could tolerate them up until I approached my twenties, when my own sensitivities to odor became more pronounced. But I wasn\u2019t prepared to give up on finding scented lotions and perfumes that I could wear without risk.\nWhen I moved to France, the birthplace of modern fragrance, I searched for something more sophisticated that would reflect my evolving identity and sense of style. I tested les grands classiques from Chanel, Guerlain, and Dior; I found success, for a time with J\u2019Adore. I made it just over two years before its florals and trail of musk became a trigger. From there, it was Diptyque Do Son and See by Chlo\u00e9 until they, too, made my head spin if even a hint remained on my clothing. Bombarded by too many odors at once at departments stores like Galeries Lafayette or multi-brand beauty stores when I would attempt to find an alternative, I all but gave up the search.\nTo add to the complexity of understanding this particular sensory trigger, the response to smell is not related to the intensity, which I assumed was at play, but a specific fragrance\u2014strong perfume of one type elicits a reaction while an equally strong smell may not, but the reasons as to why escape specialists. \u201cThe scents that bother patients are individualized and can evolve over time, but a few patients will always have a particular trigger,\u201d Marmura adds.\nIn my case, the story does have a happy ending. Recently, I spent more than an hour with the teams at L\u2019Artisan Parfumeur, the iconic Parisian perfume brand founded by chemist-perfumer Jean Laporte in 1976, to speak about the origin and composition of each scent and to smell those which seemed best suited to my needs and sensitivities. There were a few strong contenders: M\u00fbre et Musc, the brand\u2019s founding and bestselling scent with seductive blackberry notes; L\u2019Et\u00e9 en Douce, which recalls fresh linens and summer air; and Bucoliques de Provence, the first in a new collection of fragrances to mark the brand\u2019s 40th anniversary this year and is inspired by the French town of Grasse.\nBut it was Premier Figuier Extr\u00eame, the second fig scent created by Olivia Giacobetti, that I found most compelling. Where Premier Figuier, which she developed in 1994, is a leafy scent, with notes of milky sap, the Extr\u00eame version (an eau de parfum) leans sweet and woody, amplified by a ripe fig smell. I love the way it develops on my skin over the course of a day and adds to my personal style. I can only hope that the particular memories I will create while wearing it will keep the migraines at bay.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "). Those of you who want to try some, or a small decant, and who know where to find me, feel free to drop me a note! Thanks for the tip, Kevin!\nIf $100 is the new free, doesn\u2019t $35 mean buy 2? LOL kidding!\nI\u2019m so hoping you\u2019ll save me a teeny tiny sample\u2026.but I just can\u2019t imagine anything dislodging Philosykos from my figgy heart.\nDaisy: buy THREE, I\u2019d say! I like the naturalness of this fig very much.\nhush! you just stop that sort of talk!\nWasn\u2019t it Kevin\u2019s fault that you ordered FOUR Balsam de la Mecca (I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right name) bottles?!?\nha! we\u2019re up to 6 now. He wrote the review therefore I get to blame him. This is just how things work in the Daisy-centric universe\u2013haven\u2019t you figured that out yet?\nJoe, you\u2019re welcome\u2026tell me what you think.\nGreat review, and being a huge tree lover I found this to be very interesting \u2013 thank you so much. I wanted to like Philosykos but it had a fairly strong chemical note on my skin. This sounds like it might finally be the fig scent for me.\nthat is so wild Rapple. On me Philosykos is sweet creamy figgy almost floral \u2014all soft and cuddly with an earthy undertone\u2026.love the stuff! I guess you\u2019ll have to console yourself with a dab of 180 Ans\u2026.\nYeah, I\u2019ll try to feel better with the 180 but it will be tough\u2026.. NOT! LOL!\nRappleyea: I smelled a brand new bottle of Philosykos recently and it seemed \u2018different\u2019 to me. I\u2019m praying the bottle was \u201coff\u201d, had been scalded in the sun\u2026etc!\nYou keep telling yourself that Kevin. Don\u2019t even think that ugly \u201cR\u201d word!\nSounds delicious. Note to self: need small decant of Philosykos.\nDissed: glad to have jarred your memory!\nAnother great review Kevin\u2014- for some reason I\u2019m most intrigued by the prospect of a reed diffuser in this\u2026.seems like it\u2019d be yummy and soothing at the same time!\nI was afraid to read your review\u2026..we all know what the Balsamo della Mecca review did to me!! And in case you didn\u2019t know: my splitting ONE bottle has turned into splitting SIX bottles\u2026.you are a dangerous man.\noh good lord\u2026.don\u2019t review them! I can\u2019t afford it!\nohhh, you mean this line \u201cInfusion Organique\u201d whew! ok\u2014-I thought you meant the La Via del Profumo line and was momentarily filled with panic!\nAll hail Kevin, the Lemming King.\nI think I was right behind Joe in the ordering line. Because you can never have enough fig. And it might lead to enlightenment.\nHa! Enlightenment for only $35!! sign me up!\nDaisy: my dear, you WANT, NEED, DESIRE, COVET too much to ever be enlightened!!! HAHAHA!\nAs a brand new perfumista, I sampled many, many perfumes trying to find a fig I can really love. I haven\u2019t found it yet \u2013 so many of them smell too much like fig leaves and not enough of the fruit., or, they smell too milky sweet like you mentioned. Maybe I\u2019ll give this one a try. My other cheap thrills fig is Ex Libris by Tokyo Milk.\nI\u2019ve only sniffed a couple of the Hermes fragrances, but the one that stuck in my mind to try again is Un Jardin en Mediterranee. Maybe it is time for another round of figs.\nJulia: oh, I\u2019ll have to try Ex Libris then\u2026at least a soap or two.\nK \u2013 I\u2019d stick w/the perfume for this one. It\u2019s closer to the Mediterranee end of the fig spectrum; more sharp, less creamy. It really IS good, as cheap thrills go. I\u2019ll be curious to try this one; the Diptyque is much too coconutty-sweet on me.\nSorry, kids distracting\u2026 the first \u201cthis one\u201d above was Ex Libris, and the second the Buddha\u2019s Fig. Gracious.\nI really like Ex Libris; by far the best thing I\u2019ve tried from Tokyo Milk.\nBeautiful review K, I love your writing. It calls to mind the book Siddartha by Herman Hesse, one of my all time faves.\nI think sometimes it\u2019s almost worse when the rave review is for an affordable \u2018fume rather than an extravagant one\u2026 the (relatively) cheap price makes it easier to justify an unsniffed purchase! I mean, $35!?!? How can I NOT afford it!!!\nk-scott: that does seem to be the case!\nThe only figgie I know/own is Artisan\u2019s Premier Figuier \u2013 how do these compare? I sometimes get a bit overwhelmed by a sort of sandalwood/savoury coconut tinge and feel I\u2019d prefer something sweeter but greener.\nJillie: the L\u2019Artisan was never a favorite of mine and I\u2019ve not smelled it in years. It was very watery on me. Maybe someone else has smelled it recently and can comment.\nI\u2019d happily give you mine if I lived in the States!\nMy Sweetie has a wonderful pipe tabacco that has a sweet virginia tabacco and ( I swear I\u2019m not making this up) a sort of fresh fig newton scent. Now that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for! Not milky/sweet so much as jammy/rich. It\u2019s a great blend and to be honest if I could find a fragrance that captured those notes I\u2019d be all over it..or it would be all over me, I guess.\nThere is something about pipe tobacco wafting through a room, a sensual scent you want to keep breathing in. Why it hasn\u2019t been captured is puzzling, but then again, I\u2019m a \u2018relatively\u2019 new perfumista. Maybe an elder could enlighten us? I\u2019m sitting in lotus pose until further word. I\u2019m definitely going to try OBF.\nMeadowBliss: I\u2019ll have to think a bit\u2026a straightforward pipe tobacco\u2026.\nMomLady, sounds like something Serge Lutens would make!\nYes, he should. Using Mac Baron\u2019s Cube or even W.O.Larson\u2019s Old Fashioned pipe tabaccos as reference scents! I don\u2019t know that it even has to approximate lit tabacco..these smell so yummy just filling the pipe.\nOrganic fig? I stand in line. Fun thing to give it to my brother who is a yoga teacher. Has to be organic then, he cares a lot about that.\nMYBB: this sounds perfect for him!<|endoftext|>"

Form a shopping team of friends and family and divide the holiday shopping wish list to accomplish the most in the least amount of time!\nPay attention to brands that rarely go on sale: These include Tod\u2019s, Mountain Hardwear, Electric, Marmot, Prada, Ray-Ban, The Sak, Oakley, Christian Dior, Tumi, Vilbrequin, Ferragamo, Johnston & Murphy, Moncler, Patagonia, Reef, Fossil and Hurley.\nFollow your favorite retailers on social media: And sign up for e-newsletters - they sometimes will post special sales and offers exclusively for their followers.\nUse savvy saving websites to save money: Score everything from cash back offers (both in-store and online) to promo codes, free shipping and more on sites like RetailMeNot.\nBuy toys before December 15: I recommend scooping those up soon before the popular items run out of stock.\nShop on weekday mornings: The malls will be less crowded with the kids in school, and you can get everything done before the crowds arrive later in the afternoon.\nDo your research: See which retailer will have the items you need for the best price. You can use savings sites like RetailMeNot to see which store is having the best sales and discounts, and then pair that with price comparison tools to find the best price on what you need.\nKeep an eye out for big beauty deals: I recommend paying attention to beauty deals this holiday season, it's one of the top categories to shop in terms of sales. Think makeup palettes from Tarte, gift sets from Sephora \u2013 those are all hot gifts and we\u2019re already seeing early sales from those stores. We\u2019re also seeing an increased demand and interest in subscription services this holiday, which includes subscriptions like Birchbox for the beauty and skincare fanatics. Beauty shoppers should be on the lookout for promotions on these services too given their rise in popularity as a holiday gift.\nThe Mirror is an incredible (albeit pricey) gift for any fitness lovers out there. It's essentially a portal to a slew of at-home workout classes and top trainers that you can enjoy from the comfort of your own home.\nAfter a workout, there is nothing worse than heading out into the freezing cold without a huge warm jacket. As far as puffy coats are concerned, this one is about as snuggly and warm as they come.\nIf The Mirror isn't in your price range - or isn't the kind of thing your gift recipient might want - then try Sweat With Bec's great booty band set, which offers up three different bands, and a load of exercise options that you can do at home to get that booty in great shape.\nIt is remarkably rare to find a pair of sneakers that combine fashion with function, but these Hoka One One leather options hit both nails right on the head.\nWe've all been to a workout that has left our hair looking... less than brilliant. Thankfully, if you have this Lele Sadoughi gem stashed in your gym bag, bad hair can very quickly be concealed in no time. Plus, it will keep your ears toasty and warm.\nFor many, a Peloton bike is the ultimate fitness gift this festive season because it allows your favorite spinning nut to get their fix without ever leaving home - and in the winter, there's really nothing better!\nWhy is it that working out gets so much easier when you have a great outfit to wear? Adding this cropped hoodie to your closet will have you hitting the gym in no time.\nSometimes it's tricky to workout without someone guiding you through your sweat session. \nMakeup might not be the first thing you think of when you're trying to find a fitness-focused gift, but it's just so handy to have a few travel size goodies stashed in your gym bag, and these Benefit options are perfect for such an occasion.\nSpeaking of gym bags, they're a bit like Goldilocks and her porridge... they're either too big, too small, or too ugly.

        "passage": "Diptyque Paris has been synonymous with adding refined fragrance into everyday life since 1961. From luxurious home fragrance to refined candles and bespoke perfume, the French Maison has kept reinventing itself while expanding its portfolio throughout the years. Celebrating it\u2019s 60 year anniversary last year with a festive collection of products we all know and love, 2022 marks the embarkment on a new journey and into a brand new product category: Household cleaning. Starting off with a line of 5 products: A dishwashing liquid, multi-surface cleaner, leather and wood care lotion, perfumed ceramic, and true to the house, an odour-absorbing candle that you can light after cooking. Being a traditional house with modern values, the bottles are refillable and made from recycled glass, while the products are biodegradable and made from 99% natural ingredients.\n\u201cSwept along by the imagination of its founders and their innate sense of beauty, the Maison diptyque takes delight in inventing new ways of perfuming your days while adding enchantment to your evenings. Giant candles for indoors and outdoors, scented wax ovals and diffusers for the car to name a few, have introduced sophisticated accords to contexts where, though unexpected, have proven most welcome. Here, fresh notes courtesy of Baies. There, the woody fragrance of Figuier. A daily inspiration, and a pleasure that\u2019s always fresh and new.\nPresenting the arrival of La Droguerie, a fresh companion to diptyque\u2019s perfumed creations, complete with assorted turns, twists and sideways steps. A full collection of household cleaning products, an invitation to care for the interior of your home, blending beauty with utility and sensual enjoyment with respect for the environment. An evolution, possibly even a domestic mini-revolution: satisfaction need no longer wait for the sight of a job well done. The fine objects in this collection are pleasing to the eye, while its fragrances send the imagination roaming.\nThe olfactory compositions in La Droguerie were born out of Diptyque\u2019s perfuming expertise. Their essences, picked one by one from the Maison\u2019s herbarium of scents, bring their unique, delicate accords to the practical tasks of everyday life. Hour by hour, from kitchen to laundry room, from bedroom to living room, a pleasing stroll amid fig trees and orange blossom, accompanied by bouquets of basil or polished wood.\nresponsibility as highly as it does the beauty of its objects and the sensual enjoyment they provide. Its formulations, contents and fragrances keep all these promises \u2013 now and in the long term.\nThe liquid formulations comprise ingredients that are 99% natural, or of natural origin and are biodegradable. With the exception of the Anti-Odour Candle, they are all accredited by Ecocert, the global specialist in the certification of sustainable practices. They respect the environment and human health but needless to say, without any loss of performance.\nThe amber bottles in the La Droguerie collection are made of recycled glass. They can also be refilled quite easily, from refill containers that are themselves 100% recyclable. One simple motion, and they\u2019re full again. Sold without box or instruction leaflet, each year these refills save an average of two tonnes of paper along with a significant amount of ink. The Ceramic Oval for wool and delicate textiles with cedar wood can also be refilled in a moment. Enduring beauty combined with reduced waste.\nFound in the Diptyque Droguerie is a dishwashing liquid with orange blossom, cleaning brush, a multi-surface cleaner with vinegar, a leather and wood care lotion with beeswax, a ceramic oval for wool or delicate textures with cedar wood, and an anti-odour candle with basil.\nDiptyque and La Droguerie are available in the Diptyque store in Amsterdam, at Skins Cosmetics, and on diptyqueparis.com.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "No matter how I am feeling, nothing gives me the confidence boost that smelling great does. I absolutely adore a fine fragrance.\nStanding in a coffee queue, in a lift or passing by complete strangers I have frequently been complimented on my fragrance. Now as you know I am in my fifties (just) so there is clearly not any ulterior motive and the compliments certainly appear to be genuine. I certainly take them in the spirit of flattery and I am a grateful recipient. A compliment particularly about the way you smell to others can give you a great lift for your entire day.\nSo what is it that she wears, I hear you ask, that attracts so much attention?\nMy general everyday daytime fix for work is Guerlain\u2019s Insolence. Vaguely reminiscent of parma violets and frankly not everyone\u2019s cup of tea but it always smells incredible on me. Every time I wear it you can guarantee someone notices. It makes me feel great and that always gives me such an added confidence. A mid price perfume which attracts high praise from many.\nChanel\u2019s Coco Mademoiselle used to be a firm favourite of mine until my mother switched from No.5 to Mademoiselle a couple of years ago. And while we are only together a few times each month you just can\u2019t go around smelling like your mother, EVER, regardless how good that is! The plus side of this downside is that I always know what gift she will like.\nMy daughter loves the Black Orchid parfum from the Tom Ford collection and it smells spectacular on her skin. Having sampled it myself it is a fabulous scent but as with your mother, you can\u2019t go around smelling like your daughter, EVER. I personally enjoy the more woody and musky perfumes of the Tom Ford collection.\nMy evening selection is usually from one of 3 exceptionally fine fragrance houses.\nI have recently discovered Black Phantom by Kilian Hennessy (yes of Cognac fame) This is a slightly more heavy and provocative fragrance than I am generally used to and find that a small amount is more than sufficient. It\u2019s very rock n roll in the best possible sense with a dark and playful side. It does makes me smile. The packaging is wonderfully theatrical on the macabre side and full of temptation. Some of the perfumes are packaged in evening clutch bags or refillable decanters. This fine fragrance is more than perfume it is dressing table fashion.\nI love the Alaxander McQueen inspiration to this luxury fine fragrance collection. It\u2019s not surprising that Kilian has worked with the likes of McQueen, Armani and Dior as you can sense this in the products. They are full of sophistication, intrigue and excitement. Straight to Heaven is another of the fragrances that smells absolutely divine.\nThis gold serpent on the clutch bag packaging is just wonderfully fun.\nIn the Summer I also came across Diptyque in Fenwick\u2019s refurbished beauty hall in Newcastle. I was originally attracted by their wonderful diffusers and candles until I discovered their range of perfumes. Fabulously French and sophisticated.\nWhat I particularly liked about purchasing a Diptyque fragrance in Fenwick is that you receive an accompanying sample. If you try the sample and discover the scent is not for you, then if you haven\u2019t opened your fragrance you can return it. I personally think this is great marketing. The fragrance that hooked me in was Tam Dao, it is rich and velvety with fabulous woody notes. I also have a sample of L\u2019Ombres dans l\u2019eau, which is a rich berry and rose fragrance. I am saving this one for a special occasion to try it out.\nThe candle, diffuser and perfume collections are also available to buy online here.\nLast but certainly by no means least, and definitely my absolute favourite collection of the moment. I am currently in love with the Frederic Malle collection. Fortunately it is loving me back and there are several of the multitude of fragrances that particularly suit my skin.\nPortrait of a Lady, created for the collection by Dominique Ropion, gives a heady sense of bouquets of roses with hints of patchouli.\nCarnal Flower is another Dominique Ropion fragrance that most people are drawn to with heavy sexual tones of spices and sweetness.\nI am also enjoying Dries Van Noten, created by Bruno Jovanovic, with fabulously deep sandalwood notes.\nI have also recently discovered Noir Epices, created by Michael Roudnitska. This particular fine fragrance is exotic and oriental. Again with woody notes this seems to be really suiting my mood at the moment. There is just so much choice and each fine fragrance has such a wonderful story behind it in this sensational collection. I just don\u2019t have enough nights out in my calendar to do them all justice.\nEven if no one stops to compliment me these perfumes are making me feel absolutely fabulous at the moment and how I feel about myself is all that really matters.\nPrevious Post: There needs to be more mature bloggers. FACT.\nI just love Tom Ford black orchid. I like white patchouli incase the birthday fairy or Santa is on the prowl!\nProud of you for your site?<|endoftext|>"

The result? Bouncy, radiant locks.\nTreat yourself to a hair mask. Aromatherapy Associates' Enrich Hair Oil (\u00a325.50, aromatherapyassociates.com) contains murumuru butter and coconut oil to nourish damaged hair.\nRub it into the ends, leave it overnight, then wash as normal in the morning. You need only two or three pumps, so this will last you through to the summer.\nFlyaways and frizziness guarantee a bad hair day. If your hair is demanding, it's worth forking out - namely \u00a334.50, for Kerastase Elixir Ultime Versatile Beautifying Oil (lookfantastic.co.uk).\nThe key ingredient is maize oil - rich in vitamins A and E, plus omega 6, which deliver shine and suppleness. It works as a detangling treatment, a split-end balm, and a smoothing finishing spray.\nSuitable for all hair types, it's small enough to pop in your handbag for glossing on the go.\nThe A-Z of dreams: Unlock the hidden secrets of your... Fragrant, fruity fat-busters! Can the scent of raspberries...\nBlow-drying and straightening play havoc with hair, so steal the professional's shortcut to softness - Bumble and Bumble Hairdresser's Invisible Oil (\u00a330, boots.com). The spray is a blend of six essential oils, including macadamia nut and Tahitian monoi extract.\nWork it into damp hair for a silky blow-dry. Though the product feels light, it penetrates the hair and draws in moisture, so heat styling won't frazzle locks.\nNothing beats soft, sweet-smelling hair. Diptyque, best-known for its scented candles, has stepped up with Satin Oil (\u00a335, spacenk.com).\nWhite jasmine petals, ylang ylang and saffron create a honeyed, heady cocktail and keep hair tamed. Spritz a cloud over your hair instead of your usual perfume.\nBefore October, if you wanted an ammonia-free dye that would condition your hair as well as colour it, then you had to go to a salon.\nThen Garnier launched Olia (\u00a35.99, Superdrug), a home colour with oils of sunflower, camellia, passion flower and white meadowfoam. As well as giving a vibrant colour, it improves your hair's condition.\nIf your bathroom shelf has space for only one more product, make it Aveda's Beautifying Composition Oil, \u00a320 (aveda.co.uk).\nIt is packed with natural plant extracts, such as hydrating jojoba oil, which is similar to the scalp's own oils, and rosemary.\nNot only will it soothe a dry scalp and - thanks to its antioxidant ingredients - protect hair against environmental damage, you can also use it for massage, as a body moisturiser or bath oil.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " I have no worries but sometime with stranger that laugh at you and wanted to get your phone number is quite creepy for me.\nSo I rather be transparent inside the lift.   Then my mom came and she keep saying that Bebe can't run in the house lol. \nI really dont mind or dont care how big my space was as long as it's somewhere i feel comfortable with and just I suka la. Then bebe also get use to be in my place I'm so happy.  Check toilet la, open window la, then walk here walk there, turn that on turn this on. Open every single door in my house, see what's in my cabinet.  Omg I dont even complain about my place but she's the one keep complaining with my dad.\nSaying this and that then I told my mom like'You see, I'm not honeymoon here one. I'm working' HAHHAHAHA Then she start to believe me. But indeed I'm so happy because my mom finally came to my place and we start to chit chat about the house that i bought. I show her the drawing plan and how I want it to be then my bro and bebe just nap at my house lol.\nWe also unbox the mooncake and enjoy the mooncake with each other. Although my dad didn't make it this time but I'm still really happy about it. So as usual, bebe always like to sleep between my legs since he was 8 months old and now...\nEvery single time I'm working at downstair, he will still act like a baby boy and look how innocent he is. But my leg so numb I can't move at all lol because he is no longer toy poodle size lol.\nI love diffuser a lot. I placed all different kind of diffuser in my toilet, closet room, working area and my sleeping area. This year, I decided to choose a new scent for myself. Yes, not diffuser! I didn't really use fragrance on my body. I love the Chanel perfume, the chance series purple one. That was my favourite since 3 years ago but I never have that kind of'really die die want to buy' mood on that fragrance.\nWhy? Because I know I won't use. I got other perfume like Gucci flora one which I received as a gift from brands and some other 'too mature' scent that I dont really like. I just keep there and sometime I gave it to my mom or Smelly's mom if they want. But I really dont have that kind of time to put it on everyday.\nThen I wanted to be more' girly' lol or feminine, I look at Jo Malone I was like, everyone recommended that to me. I wanna try and the packaging so nice, can use as a props to take photo too. HAHAHAH Then I tried it once until now I haven pick the scent that I love the most. I can't decide until I went to Diptyque first boutique shop @Pavilion, KL few weeks ago.\nI was there to attend their new launch and try their product like body lotion and shampoo. Then I smell one of these scent that I'm so tempted to get. It's the DOSON from Diptyque. Next, I asked the staff like, do you have any perfume that has the same scent like this. They immediately introduce that fragrance for me. It cost me RM639, cost more than Jo Malone then I ask if any smaller size. They introduce me the white lighter scent one which cost me RM399, but the scent last me longer compare to Jo Malone one. Then I thought to get this as my xmas gift lol.\nSo I say nvm, I must stop myself because I'm going to tick my wishlist to get new laptop this end of the year. I must tahan!! But end of the year especially all xmas set = DAMN NICE! Like NARS product and all \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11 Then who know I finally get this. It's my birthday gift from two of my really closed friends. When I unpack it I was like wtf?!!!\nSo now the fragrance placed above my ikea drawer which I can see it everyday and use it. I always pass by perfume corner and ask Smelly try it on and see whether he like or not but he always answer me 'too much la, too strong la, not nice' Then this scent, I never told him before. So during the first time I use, he was like wah, not very strong but very nice this scent.\nI often prefer feminine flora scent which is not too sweet but just nice one. Something like Chanel chances purple one. Or sometime my mood go really well with rose scent but compare with other rose scent from Diptyque, I prefer DOSON. It's the mysterious tuberose amid berries and flowers. A fresh sweetness, like a sea breeze in a pagoda on the banks of the Tonkin Gulf. It's like sleeping on a bed of berries and flowers. Not very strong or to sweet. Just very \u6709\u6c14\u8d28.\nThen after I shared it, lots of dm asking the code or the number. Actually the packaging itself told you everything. But a plus point after Smelly told me I smells good. LOL it's like a life achievement because he always say girl putting perfume is just too much. lol He is a boring bf lol. Then after he told me this, I very scared DOSON out of stock since I use it everyday, I decided to buy some travel size one so I could take it with me during my trip.\nYes, I pass by Diptyque again and went to the shop. Guess what, online got the travel pack but in Malaysia dont have. Either you get the 6 in 1 set (only one Doson scent others one I dunno lol) or get the same bottle again. I really dunno which part of my brain not function well on the day. I bought it wtf.\nYES I BOUGHT THE EXACTLY SAME ONE -..- I think my friend will slap me if they know. I always did this. If I really love the item, I will keep on for us, one just to keep and make sure won't out of stock wtf. I changed last time but now these habit came back to me again. Some more this is not cheap and I'm not sure how I'm going to finish the whole bottle of Doson within one year HAHAHAHAHA!\nI'm sorry but okay la, consider my xmas gift wtf. Then year end got lots of advent calender! OMG I want all!!! But wait, please don't chanwon! So for now, I'm loving the Doson scent. I spray it in the morning and last until 7pm like that. At least 7-8 hours!! The black label version one is stronger than mine and last longer but I think I get the normal one enough. No need too strong lol.\nSo it's my polaroid photo memory wall. I use to look at this a lot and each time my friend who came to my place will pay a visit at this beautiful corner. I love it! It will now a complete heart shape but will grow bigger and bigger. yay!!\nWanted to say a big thank you to Apple and WaiWai who came to my place and fix the new studio backdrop for me. It's no longer a plain white wall but a super colourful one with my birthday unicorn icon design from them too. There are the owner from Party.Nutty and who did a great job to set up for my high tea session with my blogger friends.\nYou may check out their link here: https://www.instagram.com/party.nutty/. One of the service that I always recommended to my friend was the props renting service. If you have budget concern and dont really wish to keep everything that you buy and use it once only for your special celebration then you can think of renting the deco props from them.\nLike a backdrop, those people usually use during birthday, baby's shower event or anything one just RM150 like that only. Like the cupcake holders and decoration items also available for rent. They will teach you how to set up everything according your theme and you could save the amount of money by renting it from their place. Quite worth it and I received lots of dm regarding it, so I guess I could share it here with you if you want.\nFeel free to check out their instagram and contact them. A nice and chio birthday celebration set up is no longer a dream. You can choose all the props based on your budget and they are really helpful too. They help me for kindness and I'm here to share it for kindness. Of course, the owner really sibeh nice and friendly. They are now a mom of two kids but still look so cheerful and young. Plus, my high tea session sibeh chio also must say thank you to them!\nSo this is my Fujifilm XA2 super old model but I used this for years. I guess this year = the 3rd year having it in my life. Most of the time based on my work, I need to be my own photographer. So while I'm shooting for my halloween makeup look, the tripod stand suddenly out of balance and it dropped on the floor.\nMy lens freaking just dropped on the floor and it no longer attached with the camera. I can't turn the camera on so I just freaking pray for it and take the battery out and turn it again & again. So now the camera 'temporary' still working ok but the lens, couldn't attach it back with the camera body<|endoftext|>"

Besides, there is also a series that was made up of the flower of the goddess of the Luo River and the Egyptian plum, which are mostly based on the scene of wandering in a secret garden. I do not know whether the Swire hotel in Shanghai will introduce green label series in next year so that I can finish a complete collection.\nIn Swire\u2019s three House of Collective, only The Upper House of Hong Kong adopted the skincare brand REN which was known as the world\u2019s most pure, derived from the natural plant, only this can match Andre Fu\u2019s simple and clean design for the hotel. Even the most sensitive skin can also use it without any burden.\nTo echo the hotel with the largest housing area in Hong Kong, the Upper House all use the whole set of REN 100 ml, and their famous wash bag even equipped with eye cream and lipstick, and it was enough to consume a for a good time at home.\nThis is a rather low-key Australian organic brand, which is not very well-known compared with Aesop and Appellees. My first contact with this brand was stem from a set of Sodashi amenity one of my friend brought to me from the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hong Kong. Don\u2019t assume that this black packaging is unimpressive, but once the natural aromatic essential oil that was extracted from plants flowing from the bottle, you will instantly understand that the brand truly earned the right to be called Sodashi (in Sanskrit it represents \u201cthoroughly, pure and radiant\u201d).\nSodashi is still the number one amenity in my mind, however, it is not easy to buy to Sodashi products, because it doesn\u2019t possess brand boutiques like Aesop, and it\u2019s also not willing to enter the store counters, I have only seen it in the Four Season Hotel Spa center\u2019s display rack in Maldives, Milan and some other places, it was wrapped in black packaging, with a large freehand brand \u201cS\u201d Logo on it, it should be the Four Seasons Hotel Spa\u2019s favorite partner. Besides, the most beautiful and reclusive hotel The Siam hotel in Bangkok also has a Spa that was running Sodashi.\nWATERL\u2019EAU was born in 1992 to the family businesses of Antwerpen, Belgium, thanks to Spain\u2019s most legendary Alfonso XIII hotel chooses Waterl \u2018eau out of hundred brands, so that we didn\u2019t miss it, and it also let us remember the lion Logo that taking a bath in the vintage clawfoot tub.\nWaterl \u2018eau specializes in creating a relaxed atmosphere and healing scene for the bathroom. \u201cWaters of the World\u201d, its most famous line of bath care products, incorporates the best scents, colors, and imagery into the bathroom.\nOne of the most popular series is \u201cThe Green Deep\u201d, which extracts the essence from green tea, and infuses it into bath and hair care products, and the refreshing aroma and soft texture has an effective healing power.The antioxidant content in green tea can also be used on the skin and hair care, and it will play a role in \u201crejuvenating\u201d.\nIts wine\u2019s kettle-like bottles and cobblestone-like hard soaps (the soaps of its many types of soap have hooks) are all the epitomizes of the good taste of the bathroom.\nCOWSHED\u2019s literal translation is \u201cbarn\u201d, in these days, essential oils products seem all painted with black and white plants atlas on the body of the bottle, actually, it\u2019s inseparable with the club hotel brand Soho House.\nYes, Samantha of the Sex and the City who applied for the membership card of the Soho House but failed repeatedly, and then picked up a card and enjoyed a summertime, high-order summer home. Celebrity socialite Olivia Palermo and her male model husband Johannes Huebl and some other celebrities are the Soho House members.\nCowshed initially was just a spa room of the Soho House barn style, because it is difficult to find a natural skin care products that full compliance with its tune, it creates its own Cowshed product line, and all of its raw materials are picked from the famous Walled Garden picking, injected aromatherapy oil that was gathered around the world, the Cowshed products are made from it and the still insist one hundred percent British manufacturing.\nIn addition to its special bottle design, the name of the Cowshed series is also quite hilarious.\nGrumpy Cow, Knackered Cow, Wild Cow, Horny Cow, Lazy Cow, Moody Cow\u2026You can always find the one that suits you best.\nSo, if you stay in Soho House, must remember to bring the beautiful Cowshed amenities home, these bottles are enough to decorate your home into a grunge-like garden.\nThe Mandarin Oriental Hotel should be the best hotel for its amenity, actually, I will pay particular attention to all the amenity brands it has been used and I am very concerned about it. When the Mandarin Oriental Hotel come out in Milan it has chosen a Thai brand Panpuri.\nPanpuri is a combination of \u201csagacious\u201d and \u201cpalace/holy place\u201d in Thai. It was a newborn which was only started in 2003, but it still adheres to traditional method and now it has occupied in the apex of the pyramid in Thai Spa brands.\nIn addition to appearing in the top-level stores of the hotels such as the Four Seasons Hotel, The Mandarin Oriental Hotel, and Harvey Nichols, Panpuri is also been deeply loved by the Thai royal family.\nAt the moment, the hotel\u2019s keenest requisition for Panpuri is the Thai jasmine and mint as a reserved fragrance, its refreshing smell can help you relax on a tired and irritable journey.\nJo Malone is in the process of transforming to common perfume, but its perfume modulation power is still worth applauding. The founder Jo Malone love to blend perfume from an early age when her adult life began, she began to work in the daytime, and in the evening she doing face care for her clients in her kitchen. Once, she gave homemade myristica fragrant and ginger flower fragrance bath oil to her clients, and later it has a great vogue.\nSince then, this non-professional perfumer depends on her amazing perfume control and talent, created a large number of only 1 to 2 kinds of main perfume which are loyal to the plant itself, wrapping with black and white packing and suitable for many fragrances conjunction spray perfume.\nWith a sense of smell fashion and absorption towards cross-boundary, HongKong land Mandarin Oriental Hotel is among the first hotels that start using Jo Malone amenities, after that, Shangri-la, London, and Hong Kong peninsula are all successively introduced Jo Malone amenities to its high order suite.\nIn 1961, interior designer Christian Gautrot, painter Desmond Knox-leet, and theater director Yves Coueslant were at 34 Boulevard Saint Germain Avenue, Paris. Diptyque\u2019s perfume has no fancy name and is usually named after its taste. The fragrances are pure, retro, and the aroma is not complex but reflects the uniqueness of each fragrance.\nThe Mandarin Oriental, who specialized in the preparations of bathroom amenities, made Diptyque their amenity supplier when Mandarin Oriental Hotel first hotel move into Paris, and it is the earliest hotel that adopts Diptyque.\nAfter that, the Taipei Mandarin Oriental Hotel also introduced the whole Diptyque series to its hotel based on the concept of the fantasy castle.\nThis brand\u2019s amenity has got a roaring reputation when moving into the file of hotel salon fragrance. The motives of Penhaligon\u2019s perfume mixture are extremely accidental. Founder William Penhaligon once opened a facial repairing shop next to the Piccadilly Avenue.\nThe hot and humid steam, the soap, the bath oil and Wilde-like British idealism inspired William\u2019s passion for the perfume modulation. In 1872, Penhaligon\u2019s first perfume was born, and the perfume\u2019s name is called \u201c the Hammam Bouquet \u201c.\nThis perfume seems to will lead you to an ancient room where there is the smell of rosin and old books lingering. The Blenheim Bouquet which was introduced in 1902 by Penhaligon\u2019s, was Churchill\u2019s favorite perfume, and it still got the two royal plaques.\nMy first time met Penhaligon\u2019s amenity was in the Langham London hotel, and they chose Quercus fragrance at that time. Pen\u2019s introverted England style is a natural counterpoint to the legendary antique hotel.\nLe Labo is another salon-scented brand that has been taken away by Estee Lauder after Jo Malone, Le Labo, however, apparently still maintains a higher social status price, which is remaining at the price twice as expensive as Jo Malone.\nLe Labo, meaning \u201claboratory\u201d in French, and it was simple and crude in both its store, product image, and packaging. Every drop of Le Labo perfume is absolutely worthy of the high bills you paid. And the purchase of Le Labo will give you a sense of customization that is superior to other brands \u2014 the perfume will<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Sorry to be so behind in writing this review that was promised on the last post. I\u2019m behind the eight ball lately and my blog hasn\u2019t been getting the attention it deserves.\nFirst there was a whirlwind week in California. Highlights included my son\u2019s graduation from USC, Mother\u2019s Day brunch in West Hollywood and dinner in Santa Barbara, celebrating my niece\u2019s 21stbirthday and CorePower hot yoga classes in Santa Barbara. The week-end started out on a stressful note given that my son\u2019s phone was \u201cstolen\u201d the day we flew in to LA.  Namaste!\nNow on to the review I promised on my last post.\nI discovered new niche brand Kierin at the recent Sniffapalooza Spring Fling event. Over lunch we heard from Mona Maine de Biran, co-founder and president of Kierin NYC, about the story behind the brand she founded with her husband, Didier. Didier Maine de Biran is a 20 plus year beauty industry veteran who has worked with numerous prestige brands as Bulgari, Chanel and Prada. Oh, and Mona was an international model and is also a gifted story-teller. It seemed like a match made in heaven to launch a perfume brand.\nKierin\u2019s debut quartet includes four unisex fragrances: Santal Sky, Nitro Noir, Sunday Brunch and 10:00 Flirt.\nShe passed around samples of each scent, all of which were made by nose Matthieu Nardin. I recently fell in love with one of Nardin\u2019s perfumes created for Miller Harris \u2013 Lumi\u00e8re Dor\u00e9e \u2013 when I was in London in January. I was even more intrigued obviously when I heard the name of the perfumer.\nAccording to Maine de Biran, their choice in perfumer was based on their commitment to producing sustainably sourced scents and Nardin\u2019s ability to combine traditional techniques and materials with the latest in technical innovations. Each scent in the collection began as a mood board and story of real New York City life. Each perfume was a collaboration with Nardin and Didier Maine de Biron, who spent months doing the fine tuning.\nI think all four scents are really interesting but the one that seemed to be calling my name was 10:00 AM Flirt aka HighLine Flirt. If you\u2019re not familiar with the High Line, it\u2019s this amazing urban trail which opened in 2009 on Manhattan\u2019s West Side. It was built on a historic freight rail and offers the opportunity for visitors to experience nature, art and design. While I\u2019ve never personally done any flirting at the High Line I can see why they picked this spot to create a New York mood.\nThe packaging describes the vibe as \u201cfresh, flirty, magnetic\u201d.\nNow that I\u2019ve had the chance to wear 10:00 AM Flirt over the past 2 weeks, I feel like I\u2019m getting to know it a little better. This is definitely greener and woodier than the scents I normally gravitate towards. It\u2019s also more feminine smelling then the other three Kierin NYC scents but this isn\u2019t your typical feminine floral.\nThere\u2019s a green, dusty and slightly milky quality which I\u2019ll attribute to a fig note. I knew it reminded me of another scent which I thought was James by Rosie Jane, but when I did a spritz on opposite wrists of both scents, 10:00 AM Flirt was much greener and sharper than James. It\u2019s more of a Diptyque Philosykos kind of scent but not quite as creamy.\nThe box lists cashmere wood as another note but I\u2019m pretty sure that there is no such thing. Cashmere wood, as used in fragrance, is a blend of oils such as cedarwood, musk, amber and vanilla. There\u2019s definitely a woody, musky, rain on warm pavement vibe going on.\nMissing in action was the gardenia note that\u2019s listed. I was a little disappointed since I love gardenia and could have sworn I smelled it in this scent at the Sniffapalooza event. There is some floral note included but it smells more like jasmine to me now. If indeed it is gardenia it\u2019s operating in stealth mode. I\u2019m like a blood hound when it comes to tracking gardenia in in a perfume and came up empty.\n10:00 AM Flirt is an invigorating fragrance with a lot of pizzazz. \u201cUnisex\u201d fragrances are clearly trending now but the reality is that people like whatever it is they like, regardless.\nI\u2019ll definitely be wearing this but mostly layered with one of my favorite scents, Replica Flower Market. It\u2019s a winning combo and actually had someone lean into me today and asked what I was wearing.\nThis entry was tagged James by Rosie Jane, Lumiere Doree by Miller Harris, Philosykos by Diptyque.<|endoftext|>"

I\u2019ve got to get out my Caravelle Epicee sample and see if I have that Histoires de Parfum sample (I don\u2019t think I do). Thanks for adding this fragrances to the cumin list!\nA wonderful article, Angela! I do agree with your rating of Kingdom as \u201c10\u201d on the cuminometer. Thinking about it gives me the shivers, and I use a lot of cumin in my cooking!\nIf there were a periodic table of the elements for perfume, Kingdom would hold its own special place, that\u2019s for sure.\nI also find a lot of cumin\u2014in a good way, mostly\u2014in Amouage Epic Woman and in Le Labo\u2019s Rose 31. It\u2019s interesting that they\u2019ve also put this scent (Rose 31) in a laundry soap\u2014I wonder how that reads on clean sheets or clothes?\nThat\u2019s so funny about the Le Labo Rose on sheets and towels! I hadn\u2019t even thought of that. I wonder if they engineered it out\u2013or down\u2013in the laundry soap?\nJanice \u2013 I was going to comment below that Rose 31 is one of the only cumin fragrances that I actually really like and enjoy wearing. It has more of a fresh aroma (like in freshly cooked food), and it just pairs so wonderfully with that rich rose they use. My husband really likes this one too. Good one!\nCumin seems to do well paired with fresh flowers, it seems.\nI detect a huge dose of cumin in Angel, but it\u2019s never listed in the notes. I find cumin in perfume revolting, but I love it in food.\nOh, that\u2019s interesting.  I will now, though.\nI know what you\u2019re talking about \u2014 I first noticed a cumin-like note in Angel La Rose. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s deliberate or an aspect of the patchouli.\nI usually like cumin. I love Idole de Lubin but I think it\u2019s the cumin in it that makes it seem to be a love/hate fragrance for people.\nTo me, the cumin is relatively subtle in Idole de Lubin, too. It feels more about rum and wood. I think people are really sensitive to cumin.\ni tested now my Jubie and the cumin in the kitchen. my o-meter is not working very well. Jubie was a 1/10, real cumin was a 7/10\u2026.\nShouldn\u2019t real cumin be a 10/10?\nForget about cumin! Go back to bed! I hope you\u2019re feeling better soon.\nNoses and skin are so tricky. I admit my cumin-o-meter is strictly subject. Maybe yours should be a 1 to 7 scale!\nI mean \u201csubjective\u201d of course.\nPdN Vetyver has a curry-like note that I experience as cumin-I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a note that is native to the vetiver or not.\nI haven\u2019t tried the PdN Vetyver. Now I want to, though!\nIt does have a cumin note. It\u2019s a very unique treatment of vetiver, one that I like very much.\nI\u2019ll definitely try it, then.\nDipyque\u2019s L\u2019Autre had cumin, I believe. Unfortunately for me it was way too much Indian curry restaurant, but my DH liked it.\nDoes he wear it, then? Hopefully you like it on him, at least.\nYes, this is the one that came to mind when I read the thread title. It smells to me, not like something from India but rather: INDIA! Itself. In a bottle.\nOf course, the only place you can get a bottle now is a Diptyque boutique.\nI think I have a sample around somewhere. I\u2019ll go find it\u2026.\nMy thoughts exactly, and L\u2019Autre calls for the Cumin-o-Meter to go up to 11!\nI think it\u2019s fine for the cumin-o-meter to bust over 10 for the right fragrance! It sounds like L\u2019Autre is it.\nAh, cumin. The great divider. I do love the warm, sensual edge a dose of cumin can lend a fragrance, and it shows up in a surprising number of classics once you start looking for it.\nFemme\u2026ehh. I want to love it, I get a kick out of smelling it, but it borders on unwearable for me. There\u2019s cumin, and then there\u2019s CUMIN. Femme\u2019s cumin is rendered in neon. It does smell rather drier, more elegant, and less sweaty/musty in winter as opposed to summer. (Yes, I\u2019ve made the mistake of wearing Femme in warm weather. Once.) I may give it another go once it cools down over here.\nFemme is on the dividing line for me, too. As much as I love it, I save it for dead cold and the right frame of mind. Still, I wouldn\u2019t be without a bottle.\nAre we talking about Femme EdT or EdP? I have the EdT and get only the faintest cumin note that is very fleeting. Being a \u201cmaximalist\u201d I have taken cumin powder and oil and let sit to dab on top to take it up a notch, I like it but it doesn\u2019t last. I wonder why no one visits any more.....\nI have the EdP and am not sure I\u2019ve smelled the EdT. In fact, I didn\u2019t know there was an EdT in the new Femme. But to ratchet it up with kitchen cumin is very brave! Maximalist indeed!\nAngela, sorry to be adding this so late, but if possible, can you tell me where to find Femme in EdP. Searched feverishly on the web and all the North American sites seem only to have the EdT. Love Femme but wish it had a bit higher intensity and lasting power, therefore the search for EdP. Huge plug for Jubilation, sweet but not cloying, intense but not annoying, my next Amouage aquisition, as soon as I refinance the house.....!!!\nIt looks like I misled you! I just went to examine my bottle of Femme (I had to use a magnifying glass, even, since the bottom label had been stamped over with a serial number) and it looks like it\u2019s also the EdT version. I\u2019m sorry! It\u2019s so rich I thought for sure it was the EdP.\nI saw George Clinton (Funkadelic, Parliament) at the airport once and walked past him. He smelled like cumin, straight up, and it was lovely. I was skeered to talk to him but have always wondered if it was a fragrance or hair product or he just ate a lot of it. He probably wondered why I was wandering near him so often!\nI will have to put on some Kingdom later (going to Sephora now so need to be scent-free) to see if I get the cumin hit. I must not mind it, because the things on your cumin-o-meter list that I have smelled, I have liked, own, or plan to own. Plus I like and/or own some of the other suggestions!\nI wonder what other controversial notes we could meter-ize? Civet? Lavender? Hmmm\u2026.\nGeorge Clinton! I went to a Funkadelic concert once and lasted about 4 hours before I had to quit. George kept on going. Do you think it was good, clean BO on him?\nI was thinking that might have been what it was, too. That reminds me of when I was a teenager and my friend I met some rock star. (Must have made quite an impression if I can\u2019t remember who it was.) After hugging him our coats both smelled like him for weeks. We refused to wash them, and I remember my friend Kim shrieking at us: \u201cIt\u2019s BO! You guys are intentionally saving someone\u2019s BO? Wash it! That\u2019s disgusting!\u201d But we loved him, and we thought he smelled wonderful. Serious, though\u2013 no idea who it was.\nI\u2019m going to pretend it was Leif Erickson.  Seriously, though, I saw him once at La Luna, and this was in the late 1990s.\nIt may very well have been the same place, although it would have still been Pine Street Theater at the time. I want to say it was Satyricon, and it was someone from Pearl Jam, but I could be wrong.\nI don\u2019t get BO from cumin, just cumin. It smelled like the true spice.\nSee, now I really think I need to compare cumin with straight BO.\nOh please could someone do civet?! That would be fabulous.\nWhew! That would be a good one.\nI second the civet request!\nI love George Clinton! My little girl loves funk music \u2013 it\u2019s funny to watch her try and dance to it. I can totally see him smelling like cumin \u2013 I imagine him rubbing it into his crazy hair.\nI bet she loves reggae, too! Kids seem to go nuts over it.\nJust spritzed a bit of my Kingdom \u2013 I can see now that I just<|endoftext|>"

Take it yes in autumn and taste its moderate longevity and its soft trail.\nAn aroma that is too independent and perfect, so we can define Sunday Cologne by Byredo, which belongs to the Woody Aromatic olfactory family for Women and launched in 2011.\nUndoubtedly, the Sunday Cologne by Byredo is one of the most famous and best Women Perfumes with a clean scent to buy in 2021.\nThis perfume has notes that are very floral, but with some chords that will always make you feel in the right place for being so clean.

        "passage": "I bought another brush (of course you did Mimi, you needed another brush like a dog needs ticks). The Laura Mercier Pony Tail brush was not only recommended to me by you guys, dear readers but also at the counter the last time I chatted with an artist. You know me, it didn't take much convincing.\nOh, NARS Outremer. Probably one of my favorite blue eye shadows. It's matte, it's bold, it's blue.\nAnd yet somewhat tricky to use.\nHere you can see it in pan form, in the NARS New Wave Palette that I bought a couple years back. Sorry the pans aren't pristine, but hey - there's proof that I use this palette.\nAmerica's birthday is around the corner - so I'm pretty excited. Independence Day is one of my favorite holidays; a time to reflect back on our nation's birth and to spend time with family and friends. I'm really hoping that by next year, this house business will be settled and we'll be able to have our families over for a huge barbecue with copious amounts of meat products.\nI know it's not Monday quite yet, but I have non-makeup/nail related things to discuss. Today's post contains some pretty pictures, some personal updates and a few housekeeping notes. A few weeks ago, I mentioned I was in the LA area. We spent one of the mornings at Huntington Library, which simply has one of the most beautiful grounds ever. If you ever get a chance to walk their gardens or have tea at the Rose Garden, I highly recommend it.\nGood day, readers.\nI love being able to unveil a new Rescue Beauty Lounge collection. It's like letting your friends in on a secret! Today I'd like to share with you the Anatomy of a #KDrama Collection, seven shades that come with their very own story. Without further ado, hear it directly from Ji.\nYou know, I go to Target at least once a week so I think I must glance at Sonia Kashuk brushes dozens of times each year. How is it I don't have more SK products? I think maybe it's because Target rarely ever discounts them (I think I've seen a 5% sale on core products?) and you know me. I can't stand buying things at retail pricing. Sure, I may indulge in high end products quite often but I'll be damned if I don't wait for some sort of sale or GWP offer.\nI didn't mean to go a week without blogging but I was just short on time last week! We were in LA last weekend for our wedding reception (which I uh, managed to miss by being really sick). If you remember, we were legally married last year, but since my family is so spread apart (most of my family lives in Shanghai and LA), my parents wanted to throw us a reception when more of us could get together. It was really nice to see my aunts and uncle who live in China, since I haven't been back there since 2008.\nToday I just wanted to share some of the products that I've been really loving this summer. Is it hot where you live right now? It's been scorching here, with temperatures over 100F the past few days. Perfect pool weather.\nI've had a few manicures lately that I haven't really shared on the blog but have gone up on Instagram. I only managed to take one good picture of each manicure, so I'm just lumping it into one post.\nAbove: Bettina Grape, Zoya Cole, Essie Butler Please, OPI My Boyfriend Scales Walls. Done using nail striping tape and free hand painted.\nI hope you all had a great weekend! I've been a bit busy, going from store to store, trying to find a dress for our wedding reception next weekend and to buy last minute gifts for relatives that I haven't seen in years. I'm unwinding now and wanted to review one of my favorite fragrances Diptyque Philosykos. Philosykos is arguably the most popular fragrance by Diptyque and comes in EdT, EdP, solid perfume and perfumed oil, as well as a body lotion. Since the EdP and EdT develop differently on me, today I'm reviewing just the Philosykos Perfumed Oil Roll On.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " do you have any other strange perfume habits you want to share?\nWhat is it about something that's hard to get that makes you want it more?\nNasomatto has a line of perfumes some of which are cheekily built around the idea of narcotics. Perfumes in the line have names like Hindu Grass, China White and Absinth. Black Afgano \"aims to evoke the best qualities of hashish\" and \"arouse the effects of temporary bliss.\"\nIf you're afraid that you're going to attract dogs in the airport, don't worry. It's not the smell of hashish that Nasomatto is trying for, but the idea of it.\nBlack Afgano smells dry, dark and herbal and a little sweet. It's very strong when first sprayed, with big sillage for a little while, but there's some interesting development close to the skin. The main notes are dry grasses, earth and dark wood with some incense smoke and a hint of spice. As I wear it I keep thinking I smell something sweet around me but when I check my wrist it's still that strong wood, herbs and smoke. It's not until much later, when the strong top notes have faded enough, that I can detect the sweetness on my skin, a little sticky and slightly vanilla, like smelling vanilla cake.\nA bit of a mystique has grown up around Black Afgano. It is notoriously hard to get. The rumour is that because of the difficulty of acquiring its main ingredient, that only a few bottles are made at a time. This may be true, but it's also possible that the restriction on availability is deliberate. If it is a marketing ploy to make Black Afgano unattainable and therefore more attractive, it's totally working. My local shop, Noor, was able to get 6 bottles and they were all sold immediately. They may be ordering more. I'm thinking about it.\nI'm not even blown away by the perfume, but I find myself wanting a bottle because it's rare. I also like the Nasomatto line in general; they are all high quality scents and they're perfume extrait strength. I previously reviewed* Nuda, which is a very good jasmine. And I covet the bottles. They are so pretty.\nSo what do you think? Have you ever purchased a perfume just because it was rare or hard to get?\n*BTW: In my Nuda review, I complained about the Nasomatto website. It's much improved.\nDawn Spencer Hurwitz is an indie perfumer from Boulder, Colorado. She sells her perfume from the Essense Studio in Boulder and from her online shop. I previously reviewed her Secrets of Egypt collection which sought to recreate the perfumes of ancient Egypt.\nI think she's a genius. Her perfumes all smell so true; you can smell the high quality materials and the love she has for each note she uses. Every one I have tried has been beautiful in some way. The Parfums des Beaux Arts are from her \"ready-to-wear\" collection. The Essense Oils are from the Essense Studio, perfume and essential oils aromatherapy collection. The perfumes labelled Natural are made with 100% botonical materials.\nA while ago I left a comment on Dawn's blog and won a set of samples from her perfume collection. The samples were all rose perfumes. Today Facebook told me that this week Dawn Spencer Hurwitz has a birthday, so I thought it was an excellent occasion to finally tell you about the roses.\nAmerican Beauty has the feel of deep, blood-red roses. There is a little tart-berry fruitiness from the cassis up top, a soft velvety rose heart and a smooth dark woody base with lots of patchouli and a touch of balsam.\nI can smell the ocean breeze and the waterlily in the top notes of Beach Roses, giving it that salty, aquatic feel. The rose note is soft, sort of lemony and creamy. The base notes are lightly earthy and musky.\nTea Rose is a true rose fragrance that's almost hyper-realistic, like a bunch of fresh cut roses transformed into a neon sunset. It's intensely sweet and green and somewhat sharp up top, with hints of lemon and tea cutting the sweetness. It smells exactly like tea roses and much like The Perfumer's Workshop Tea Rose but it calms down to something softer and fruitier, like rose hips tea and roses.\n It opens with a curl of wood smoke up my nose Followed by a leather note underneath. There's also a lot of wood and moss in there and some tobacco. The rose isn't apparent at first, but it grows in the heart of the perfume subtly, a twisting pink and red ribbon in the darker hues of black and brown. I am not usually a fan of natural perfumes, but this one might change my mind.\nBois de Rose smells like sweet curried roses to me. Spicy curry, sweet rose and fresh green leaves are balanced with a bitter woody note in the heart and a dark mossy base.\nThe only rose perfume that I can't find listed on the DSH site, Rose Fleurette must have been discontinued. The sample card describes it as \"Delightful. Blushing. Flirtatious.\"\nAlthough Rose Fleurette is pretty, it's the only one that I'm note sure I could wear. The opening has a magic marker note, high sweet and sharp, (maybe the apple blossom?) that wrinkles my nose. But after that, it's a fresh, pale pink rose bouquet. It seems sort of fluffy like those giant peony-style cabbage roses. There's a touch of sweet and pollen-y yellow heliotrope in the base with light honey and musk.\nLike the Tea Rose, this is a \"single note\" oil. Arabian Rose is an accord meant to re-create the smell of a particular flower, the indigenous rose of Arabia. It's a big, lush, full, real rose, but more velvety in feeling than the tea rose. It's very strong at first but it softens and gets greener in the drydown.\nRose Vert is one of the \"Perfection Connoisseur Fragrances\" - four natural perfumes that form an ultra luxury line within DSH Perfumes. Each one is created with fine natural essences, rarely used in commercial perfumes because of the difficulty in sourcing them and the cost.\nRose Vert opens with lemony citrus. The roses in the heart smell somehow vintage to me, like I have rediscovered a lost Victorian perfume. Rose Vert is like something precious that was kept in a tiny crystal flacon and dabbed on the bosom of a corseted and bustled lady. It's the condensed essence of rich roses and moss.\nBeach Roses, which I think I would wear all the time, it's easy and care-free.\nAmerican Beauty for it's lush rose-red bouquet with dark patchouli.\nDirty Rose for all the smoke and leather and moss and the ambergris skin note. It's like a gorgeous and slightly rough man bringing me roses.\nI stopped by Holts on the way home tonight and spritzed on a little of two new perfumes: Jo Malone Wild Bluebell Cologne and Diptyque 34 boulevard saint germain. Both are exclusive to Holt Renfrew in Canada and I coudn't get samples for either one. So, while I still have them on my wrists, here are my first thoughts.\nA celebration of the wild English bluebell, Wild Bluebell Cologne does smell like fresh wild flowers. The top notes are sweeter with a hint of clove. The heart smells like a combination of aquatic and melon notes (is that calone?), violet leaves and lily of the valley. It smells like I just pulled a handful of wet lilies up by the roots. Did you like Tauer Carillon pour un Ange? There's something of that in it, but no leather, The base is very musky.\nNotes: Top notes: blackcurrant, green leaves, fir leaf, citruses, pink pepper, cardamom, cloves and cinnamon. Heart: rose, geranium, tuberose, iris and violet. Base: woods, resins, balsams and eucalyptus.\nTo celebrate their 50th anniversary, Diptyque released a perfume that is supposed to re-create the smell inside their flagship store - a combination of all their perfumes. An interesting idea but I don't think the perfume really works. It's a lightly spicy and woody with a strong leafy green top note and a hint of eucalyptus. But I get an off-putting sourness somewhere in the middle that keeps me from liking it.\nThe base of 34 is a nice amber.\nBottom Line: Neither one is rocking my boat but I'd recommend Wild Bluebell if you like fresh lily and musk.\nWindow Sniffing: Jo Malone Wild Bluebell and Dipty...<|endoftext|>"

A heady mix of roses and spices, this smoky scent combines notes of cinnamon and sandalwood, while a touch of patchouli - a nod to the Victorian fascination with the East - gives it an exotic flair.\n\u00a3145, buy online here.\nDrawing on the inner bohemian beauty of all who smell it, we\u2019re continually captivated by the vibrant and woody fragrance of Byredo Gypsy Water.\nFusing fresh Lemon, Pepper and Juniper Berry with amber, vanilla and pine needles, this crisp and musky fragrance immediately conjures scenes of a romantic Romany campfire nestled within the depths of a beautiful forest. Imaging technicolour clothing and a bustling outdoor community, this perfume makes us feel just that little bit closer to nature and to the magical gypsy myth we\u2019ve always dreamed of.\n\u00a388, buy online here.\nTaking on a different but consistently alluring form on each wearer, Molecule 01 is a truly one of a kind concoction.\nRumoured to be loved by Kate Moss and Daisy Lowe, this perfume was developed by rising perfumer Geza Shoen and consists of just a single ingredient - Iso E Super, which provides a distinctively woody aroma. Rich and velvety, this perfume comes and goes with varying degrees throughout the day, with many claiming it combines with individual pheromones. As a result this makes for a superbly unique and irresistible combination.\nThis powerful and intense fragrance is simply perfect for those women who like to make a strong statement by leaving a long and lasting impression with their scent.\nBeautifully contained within an Art-Deco style bottle, we\u2019d happily set this perfume amongst our delicate jewellery trinkets, no matter what the contents. As it happens however, this perfume begins with heated spices and peppery notes, before bursting open with essence of rose and jasmine that\u2019s effortlessly elegant. A final layer of musk and vanilla leaves both a decadent and deep finish that creates the most opulent olfactory experience.\nOut of all the scents that claim to capture and hold on to the smell of summer, this zesty and sparkly creation from Diptyque is by far the best.\nA cologne that\u2019s heavily interlaced with the zing and buzz of flowers on a warm summers day, this perfume contains clean and crisp notes of neroli, orange blossom, white musk and patchouli. Refreshing and sensual, this scent is a pure spirit lifter and a welcome reminder of the dolce vita.\nOriginally launched in 2010 to celebrate Creed\u2019s 250th anniversary, Aventus is the perfect fragrance for the modern man of action - bold, spirited and deliciously confident.\nInspired by the dramatic life of a historic emperor who waged war, peace and romance while riding on horseback to victory, this scent celebrates strength, power, vision and success. Opening with pineapple, blackcurrant and apple this fragrance quickly becomes more peppery with hints of patchouli and birch. The final touches of oakmoss and ambergris help deliver the parfums masculine edge, which has made it so continuously popular.\nInspired by the freedom and masculinity of the lone cowboy in a vintage Marlboro advertisement, Le Labo created Santal 33. A most powerful representation in America, men wanted to be him and women wanted to have him.\nEvoking smells of worn leather, crackling open fires and old smoking wood, this scent contains a heady combination of cardamon and iris with Australian cedarwood and violet that make it both subtle and strangely comforting.\nWorking to capture the ambience of the Mediterranean at night, this Annick Goutal fragrance helps deliver a splash of fresh, suave spice to every man.\nPresented in a sleek, elegant bottle with a label inspired by cigar brands, this scent begins with sparkling notes of Sicilian lemon, tangerine and citrus before slowly developing more depth and warmth with hints of Egyptian cumin and basil leaves. The final layer of ylang-ylang and amber helps to create this eau de toilette\u2019s remarkable oriental base. For us, a well dressed man who sips on limoncello springs to mind when we smell this.\nWorking to re-interpret and enhance the key notes found in the original Acqua di Parma cult cologne of 1916, this scent is a distinctive and gentlemanly creation that quite frankly makes us a little weak at the knees.\nUsing only the finest quality natural ingredients, this fragrance is both woody and sharp containing essence of classically fresh Italian citrus and peppery spicy cloves that help deliver a comforting warmth.

        "passage": "Written by Margit R\u00fcdiger on 28. April 2019. Posted in living.\nC&C: Your \u201eVolumizing Paste\u201c is a true volume wonder. What is the secret?\nChristophe Robin: It took me forever to find a way to give volume to the hair. I didn\u2019t want to use too much coating ingredients, because they not only coat the hair but also the scalp. Means you add volume but the scalp can\u2019t breathe. So it becomes greasy and the effect is like a souffl\u00e9. Also I wanted to fight greasy scalp because it is an issue. I use rose extracts that works like a natural hyaluronic acid. As well we have Rasul clay from Maroc to help the scalp not to get greasy and plus it puts back all of the minerals inside the hair. All together gives the volume.\nYou recommend to use a hair oil before shampooing?\nConditioner and masks are not my most preferred haircare products. They make the hair heavy and flat. For a mask there is mostly no time. For healthy scalp and hair everybody should make a pre-shampoo treatment with a hair oil, no matter what shampoo you use after. I do it since 25 years in my Paris\u2019 salon. Actually the \u201eLavender Oil\u201c was my first product I developed. You put a little bit of oil on your palms, rub it, put it on your hair and brush it before washing with shampoo. If you want you can apply the oil the evening before and leave it overnight.\nWhat is the biggest mistake women can do to damage their hair?\nUsing too much shampoo and not rinsing it well enough. In most of the shampoos there are coating ingredients like silicone. The scalp can\u2019t breathe and you have to wash it again. The more you wash it the more you make your hair sensitive. If the hair is not rinsed well, there is always product left and the hair gets no shine. Many women also put too much conditioner directly on the scalp. Makes also that the scalp can\u2019t breathe. Another bad thing are tools, they are terrible for the hair. But to use a lot of styling products is a trend nowadays. On YouTube you find some tutorials where people are encouraged to use five products on their hair, what is too much. All the ingredients grab on the hair and coat it.\nIt makes it dry and dirty and it needs a wash again.\nHow to wash hair properly?\nPut a teaspoon of shampoo in your hands. First you concentrate on the roots, you add right away a little bit of water to emulsify the product, then rinse it properly. You can wash the hair once or twice, it depends on the needs.\nDry shampoo is famous now for styling and when there is no time for a hair wash. Is that good or bad?\nDry shampoo is only good for one night. Going to bed with is like going to bed with make up on the face. The skin and the scalp must be able to breathe at night. Therefore it is important to open the windows in the bedroom. Sit down and let your head hang down. In this position you give your scalp a really good massage for four minutes. Especially when someone is stressed the scalp is tense. Normally people do not breathe properly that\u2019s why they have a lack of oxygen. Never go to bed with dry shampoo. Even more bad are tinted dry shampoos used for gray coverage. Sometimes women leave it for two weeks in their hair and sleep with it. When they do a coloration on top there is too much pigment and they develop allergies and get reactions. It is not the ammonia causing the allergy, it is the PPDs (P-Phenylendiamine) and the dark pigments.\nWhat can one do to make the hair shine?\nDull hair is a lack of hydration. There is a grandma\u2019s trick that really works. It is nothing better than vinegar. You buy it from Maria Novella, Diptyque or even cheaper from Yves Rocher. They have a framboise vinegar which is amazing. First you wash your hair and rinse it properly. Then you fill a bowl with cold water and add may be ten drops of vinegar. You use it for the last rinse on your hair and your scalp. It dissolves all rests of products and all the minerals left from the tap water. It also has an antibacterial effect and refreshes the scalp. Bacteria cause dandruff and vinegar counteracts this.\nAre there effective anti-aging measures for the hair?\nThis is difficult for me to judge. A lot of women had a lot of hair in younger ages and around their 70ies it is thinning. What I see from my clients, it happens often when they do many diets or anesthesia for surgery. What works is Omega 3 as it is contained in fish. I am convinced that the quality of the hair has to do a lot with nutrition. Eat well, breathe well. To enhance the oxygen is good for the hair and the scalp.\nWhat is for you the most important hair care product?\nHair oil. Since hundreds of years it is used. But you need an oil that is not thick like argan or olive oil. This mostly remains on the surface. And when it goes inside it removes the artificial color. That is a good trick if someone has colored his hair too dark. Instead of bleaching the hair, use argan oil and brush it in. After a few hours, the excess color dissapears. A light oil is good for a constant care of hair and scalp.\nWhich hair care product should never be missed in an inflight cosmetic bag?\nI would say baking soda is much better than a dry shampoo. Put some on a good brush and brush the hair for some minutes, you will achieve the same effect as with dry shampoo. It contains npc perfume and other ingredients that are not good for the hair. Soda is also helpful for digestion if the food was not well tolerated. Soda even feels pleasant in bathwater.\nFor which styling tool is it worthwhile to invest good money?\nAt first I was skeptical of what the Dyson hair dryer really can. Now I like it a lot because it is not noisy. Also it is lightweight and gives so much shine to the hair. I do know nothing about longterm experiences, but all my stylists like the Dyson. Also important is a good brush with natural bristles. And again vinegar. In our salon we mix 20% vinegar and 80% distilled water how to us it for ironing. We spray all brushes with it. It has an antibacterial effect and gives shine to the hair. A good brush is not cheap. But if you clean it regularly, we use white vinegar for this, it will last a lifetime.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Like most girls or should that be women as I am in my twenties, I am saving for the future. Not the most exciting thing to read granted but I am sure many will be in a similar position, so why not pass on a few penny saving tips - well as far as beauty products are involved at least.\nI loose hair grips and bands daily, for that reason it is foolish for me to pay over the odds for something that will only be used once or twice. I'm also not all that fussy when it comes to shampoo and conditioner. I know I probably should be given the nature of job but I do tend to purchase whatever is on offer at the Supermarket and save splurging for hair masks and leave in conditioner. I've also readily spoken about my love for Baby Shampoo, especially when it comes to washing my make-up brushes. You can also dilute it down to create a make-up brush cleansing spray should you wish.\nUnless it is a nail polish you are going to wear daily (and even then some of the pricer options have not lived up to expectations), I say be open to high street brands - especially for fun shades. One brand that deserves a lot more recognition for their nail lacquers is NYC. Budget friendly, readily available within the UK and with a great range of shades both classic and fashion forward too. As a side note, I seldom purchase expensive nail polish remover because I have yet to find an expensive option that delivers better results than Cutex Nail Polish remover.\nI also feel similarly in regards to lip and eyeshadow shades that I am not completely sold on - i.e bright colours. I would rather drop big bucks on an everyday lipstick that will get a lot of love, than one I may only wear once. In my opinion Rimmel have the budget lipstick market locked with their brilliant shades, texture and of course price point. Although fairly limited in shade range Rimmel's Exaggerare lip pencils and eye khol pencils are not to be missed.\nNow don't get me wrong, I love Jo Malone and Diptyque candles as much as the next guy but you really do not need to shell out big bucks to create a little ambience. Brands such as Yankee Candle, Bomb Cosmetics and my personal favourite Voluspa Candles, all offer great and affordable home fragrance options. While we are on the topic of fragrance, Zara is where to head for sweet smelling, cost effective eau de toilette and perfume options.\nNow help a gal out and tell me where you scrimp in terms of beauty products and why?\nI love the Wilko Maxi Oval Cotton Pads (50 for 50p) for removing makeup as they're much bigger than the standard one,<|endoftext|>"

I only have a small sample, I can't justify spending this sort of money right now, I make do with a very convincing clone by Eden Perfumes. One day I will buy the real thing. Maybe when the pound is stronger...\nI've read the rave reviews, I have no doubt it's a classic of its genre. But clearly that's a genre I don't much like. Smells like soap or shaving cream, as many say. As if someone wanted to re-create the smell of an actual barbershop. It's sort of powdery, presumably from a sweet lavender note: certainly not the intense herbal note of a lavender flower crushed in your palm. The anise and clove don't help me to like it either. It's \"clean\" in the sense that it smells like soap, but that's not really how I understand the word \"clean\". So not for me: I will continue to look for an aromatic fougere as my nose imagines it, intensely lavender-herbal-bracing.\nRadically underwhelming. Not offensive, not bad, but was disappointed.\nRemarkable fragrance at a very attractive price. And I'm totally in favour of florals for men.

If you want animalic that is not unpleasant, I recommend Antaeus, a magical fragrance.\nNice. But Dior Homme Intense is nicer.\u00a1Viva los perfumes florales para hombre!\nUnexciting. I'm picky and tight-fisted, don't buy fragrances that are just okayish.\nThis was the first fragrance I bought, thinking \"those designer prices surely can't be justified\", and believing the multiple good internet reviews of Jacques Bogart. My mistake (aka learning experience), and in any case not expensive. I don't like it at all: \"cheap biscuity drydown\", as another reviewer said. But also I've learned that I simply don't like sweet vanilla/tonka drydowns in this type of fragrance. So perhaps there are other Bogarts that I'd like. And perhaps you'd like this one, what do I know?\nI bought this fragrance on a whim, easily swayed (as any foolish man in their 50s might be) by the blind-test opinions of two young sales assistants: they both preferred this (on my left wrist) to Dior Homme Intense (on my right). Funny that. On the way home, I wondered whether I'd been too rash. But no: it's a truly remarkable fragrance with a quite magical smell. I struggle to describe it. The best I can do is Fragrantica's description of beeswax: \"an intimate animalic note with hints of wax and the pollen scent left by bees, deep and grounding\". The animalic is there, but aromatic and musky and I think erotic (definitely NOT the dirty goat smell of Kouros). It's a beautiful fragrance: I'm glad I allowed myself to be foolishly swayed. Hey, and I bought the Dior Homme Intense too, I was feeling flush.\nIn fragrances purporting to be fresh, I really don't like vanilla and other sweet notes. Give me dry dry dry. But this is sensuous late-night stuff, a sultry blend of flowery and vanilla darkened with something leatheresque. Like.\nI love this fragrance. Sophisticated mint + lime + vetiver. In the drydown, it doesn't degrade to sickly vanilla/tonka/amber; it stays citric and green and woody, as a fragrance of this type clearly should. Merci M. Wasser!\nI liked this fragrance very much. But unfortunately my girlfriend didn't.  I was tempted to dispute her mistaken gendering of the rose. But then I remembered who's boss, and wisely kept my mouth shut.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": ". She props her foot up on the wall behind her, bending her knee and feeling the hem of her pants ride up her shin a little, and takes a long drag of her cigarette, inhaling deeply and flicking ash down by her side. She pulls out her phone again as she exhales smoke into the thick muggy air, and types back.\nKatya smirks, and taps on the Uber icon.\nThe noise of ice rattling at the bar just to her right makes Katya wish she chosen a different table, although she\u2019s not sure she could\u2019ve snagged one. Lazy Bird, the bar she\u2019s currently sitting in, tucked beneath The Hoxton in the Fulton Market District, is loud, dark, and busy. The hum of voices battles with the piano on the other side of the room, the man seated behind it invisible to her, but the notes of Sinnerman by Nina Simone that he\u2019s playing more than audible. It\u2019s hot, almost unbearably so; outside Chicago is in the middle of summer and in here the A/C appears to be non-existent. She can smell tequila and sweat and night and it\u2019s intoxicating. There\u2019s a scrape as the chair next to her is dragged away from the table, and then she\u2019s smelling Diptyque perfume while soft lips brush against her ear.\nBlonde hair trails over her shoulder and collarbone, making her skin tingle, as Trixie drops the gentlest of kisses below her jaw before sitting down next to her. She tries to look Trixie over subtly, taking in her tight dress with the yellow and black plaid pattern and the cute little button up collar, but she Trixie catches her staring and smirks, lounging back in the chair and stretching her legs out theatrically. She\u2019s wearing white leather boots and Katya thinks her tongue might be comically lolling out of her mouth as she follows them all the way up to where her dress is clinging to the tops of her thighs. Katya tugs gently at the open neck of her shirt, glad she got the Uber home before coming here to change. She\u2019d picked a white satin revere shirt, unbuttoned to an inch above her navel, forgone a bra, and paired some tight khaki pants rolled to her lower shin with a pair of shiny black Dr. Martens derby shoes, no socks.\n\u201cWhat are you drinking?\u201d Trixie\u2019s soft voice jolts her out of her reverie, and she\u2019s leaning close, almost whispering in the noisy bar, like they\u2019re telling secrets. Katya clears her throat a little, so she\u2019s confident it won\u2019t break when she speaks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Blackthorn,\u201d she answers, swirling the amber liquid around the bottom of her tumbler. Trixie takes it from her, and sips delicately around the sliver of orange peel, making a face like she\u2019s eaten sour candy.\nKatya laughs, and watches as Trixie beckons a server over and orders a Clover Club, giving the girl a flirty smile that stirs a burning sensation in Katya\u2019s stomach. A silence settles between them, and they listen to a man get on the mic and introduce himself to the bar as Sam Trump (\u201cunfortunate,\u201d she hears Trixie snigger), before he begins to sing. Katya recognizes the melody, and warmth floods her chest at the memory of her father carrying her around in their living room, crooning the lyrics in her ear.\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Trixie\u2019s looking at her, a little concerned furrow in her brow, barely paying any attention to the girl putting her drink in front of her, who hovers for a second hoping for another flirty glance.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Katya gives her head a little shake, and downs her drink, making eye contact with a different server, who comes over and takes her glass without a word. \u201cWhy did you text me tonight?\u201d She says it a little more harshly than she\u2019d intended, the memories of her childhood still fogging her mind, but Trixie doesn\u2019t seem to care.\nThere\u2019s something in her voice that makes Katya drop back into her seat immediately, something dominant and commanding that sends a shiver down her spine.\nKatya flexes her fist, then takes a big gulp of her drink, the whiskey burning her throat and the bitterness of the vermouth making her tongue twitch. \u201cThe night,\u201d she chokes out, shifting in her seat, sweat dripping beneath her shirt between her shoulder blades.\nTrixie scoots her chair closer, leaning in to Katya closely, and Katya feels like she\u2019s suffocating; between the scent of Trixie\u2019s perfume, and the dark, hot bar vibrating with noise, bodies pressed close as the performer sings something heavy and sultry. The atmosphere is thick and heady and Katya can\u2019t sit still, Trixie\u2019s heeled shoe rubs over her ankle and slides itself up her calf and she squirms, desperate to reach out and touch and kiss.\n\u201cYou sure about that, baby?\u201d  Her lips brush the skin just below Katya\u2019s collarbone, and then she bites, sucking the flesh into her mouth and drawing it hard between her teeth. Katya can feel Trixie grinning when she groans hazily, and her hips twitch upward towards where Trixie\u2019s hand is inching up her thigh.\nI highly recommend you search Sam Trump on YouTube, and especially listen to his cover of My Funny Valentine.\nThe grin is starting to hurt Katya\u2019s cheeks now.\nMe too. Wanna get dinner later?\nCan\u2019t sorry, work to do on the Kim Barber case. Rain check!\nThe grin disappears. The Kim Barber case. Fuck. Fuck.\nSorry for the ridiculously long wait. This fic is definitely not abandoned and I really want to finish it before I start anything else... and I have lots of ideas!\nAlso the other day was my birthday so it felt like a good time to finally post this.\n She loses it promptly, and tries her best to look Shea in the eye. \u201cNo reason,\u201d she shrugs, fiddling with her spoon. Shea ducks her head to meet Katya\u2019s gaze.\nKatya looked out at the street, feeling the grin creep across her face again. It\u2019s so bright outside, and the street is bustling. Someone is playing ping pong behind them, and she mentally curses Shea for bringing them to Sawada again (\u201cbut the fairy lights, Katya!\u201d). Shea excuses herself to go to the bathroom, and Katya\u2019s phone buzzes on the table.\nShea waits for a beat, but there\u2019s no follow up. \u201cYes?\u201d she prompts.\nThere\u2019s heavy shuffling in the courtroom as everybody stands while the Judge enters. Katya glances sideways, and sees Trixie smirking at her. She looks away, down at her notepad in front of her, and tilts her head from side to side, trying to crick her neck.\nWhen Judge Hides emerges from her chambers, Katya can tell immediately that she is not in the mood. She barely looks up as she barks \u201csit down\u201d and drops heavily into her chair, shuffling notes around and huffing quietly to herself. Once the sound of people seating themselves dies down, the drop of a pin could be heard in court, as everyone waits for the Judge to speak.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all done with character witness, I sincerely hope?\u201d she mutters finally, still looking down at her notes. Trixie and Katya both stand, and glance at each other quickly.\n\u201cYes, your Honor,\u201d they both say at the same time. Katya cricks her neck again.\nKatya sits down and spends the next forty-five minutes making pretend notes on the sheet in front of her and completely ignoring Trixie. It\u2019s the closing argument tactic she opts for in almost every trial, and it very rarely lets her down. People tend to think that trials are exactly the way they see them on Law & Order, where lawyers stroll around the courtroom at will, approach the jury and speak directly to them, and argue constantly and dramatically for effect. This couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. If Trixie or Katya started wandering around giving pointed speeches or addressing jurors, any judge would reprimand them extensively. There have been a few dramatic arguments in this trial, but Trixie is no Marcia Clark and Katya is no Johnnie Cochran, they (try to) stay calm, play by the rules, and observe proper courtroom etiquette.\nSo when Trixie stands and begins her closing argument, Katya does what she always does at this point in any trial: under the guise of taking notes, she lists every single character she can dredge from her mind that features in Grey\u2019s Anatomy, then The West Wing, then Friday Night Lights, and steadfastly does not look away from her paper at any point. When she runs out of characters, she lists every president in chronological order along with their political party and the years they were in power. After this she lists every NBA Most Valuable Player in chronological order along with the team they were playing for at the time, and the year they were drafted. This is usually enough to see her through her opponent\u2019s argument, and it is this time too. When they run longer,<|endoftext|>"

But I might buy myself a swanky new candle, and will happily take recommendations.\nNote: image is Flames [cropped] by laogooli at flickr; some rights reserved.\nHm. I never ask for perfume, because I can\u2019t trust anyone to know what I like.\nUnsniffed: Amouage \u2013 Lyric for Women.\nI was thinking of getting my mom a bottle of Mythique by Parfums DelRae. I think it\u2019s glorious, and she loves florals. Other than my mom, no one else I know cares much for scented products.\nI am SO alone.\nOh. I want a bottle of Lann-Ael. Badly.\nGood luck on that Lyric! And\u2026 if for some reason you get it unsiffed and don\u2019t like it, you won\u2019t have trouble splitting it off to some of the rest of us!\nAndrea, I\u2019ve got several samples of Lyric\u2013they all came in at once. I\u2019d be happy to pass one on to you. Message me at MUA.\nThanks, Kitty. I actually just ordered samples this morning, after writing about how badly I wanted them.\nAndrea, I think your mom would love Mythique. I love it, and I\u2019m a mom of a 20 yr old.\nI actually adore Mythique. I\u2019ve been wearing my sample all week, and I can\u2019t decide if I want it for myself, or want to give it to Mom, or both. Maybe I could split it, but I don\u2019t know if she would appreciate the concept of \u201chalf a bottle of perfume\u201d, as a gift? Tacky, right?\nJoe if you were interested I\u2019ve got a bottle of Borneo that\u2019s 80% \u2013 90% full I\u2019d be willing to trade. I reckon if I don\u2019t palm it off now it\u2019s going to sit there unused for the next 8 months as the weather will be too warm during that time to get much use out of it. I\u2019m on the google groups thing if you\u2019re interested and need my email details.\nI think I\u2019d like a bottle of JM Vanilla & Anise, although I leave it to myself to buy the perfumes. Unsniffed? Hilde Soliani Fragola Salata. I think I\u2019m going to buy my MIL lots of lavender scented bath stuff, and my mother asked for rose scented Decleor and Weleda products.\nAs far as unsniffed, I think Scent Two: Laurel by Monocle x CdG is something I\u2019d love to see underneath my Xmas tree.\nI rarely give fragrance gifts at Xmas to others (usually reserving fragrance gifts for throughout the year instead).\nYEARS ago?? I forgot things I said 2 days ago. Ack.\nI know! I don\u2019t know why he thought it was so funny that I forgot something from years ago, when he could just as easily find something I forgot from an hour earlier. :O I *do* tend to remember when people are mean, though\u2026this won\u2019t be forgotten for *decades*!\nrecently I\u2019ve had the unpleasant experience of thinking about something and half way through thinking it I forget what I started thinking about. True. Horrible!\nMy most wanted fragrance gift this year vacillates dramatically between wanting another bottle of Chanel No 5 parfum or another pre-2007 bottle of Mitsouko edp. Does that make me too staid?\nMy most wanted unsiffed purchase would be the Annick Goutal Mandragore Pourpre.\nAnd this year I am not planning on giving any fragrance gifts as I gave everyone fragrance gifts last year and my family may see that as redundant. Except for my dad- he recently discovered he likes the Sean Jean I am King, and I\u2019m going to see if there are any good bargains on some more for him. And I am giving my mom some Mistral smelly soap she really likes. Does smelly soap count?\nSure, smelly soaps count!\nYes, \u201cclassic\u201d. How nice that sounds. Not frazzled\u2026overworked\u2026.\nAnn, you define Classic\u2026 Forget \u201cfrazzled,\u201d it doesn\u2019t exist!\nI have to agree, based on what I know of your tastes\u2026classy classic.\nChanel No. 5 is my favorite! I agree with classic!\nHi, Ann. I have a small bottle of Chanel 5 pure parfum. If you want to message me on MUA, maybe we could work out a trade?\nI\u2019m \u201canyothername\u201d on MUA.\nOh, yes indeed! I\u2019ll contact you very soon!\nHello, this is my first post at nst \u2013 first of all: thanks for this blog! It\u2019s a fabulous read for a fragrance-holic like me.\n3 I won\u2019t give any fragrance items as a present this year. Last year I bought Hilfiger dreaming for a cousin (a girl of 16 years), and she really liked it. But usually I find it too risky to give scents as a present.\nHi and welcome! I\u2019ve love some Jicky parfum too, although I\u2019ve only smelled a very old version.\n\u201cOnly\u201d smelled a very old version? I\u2019d call that pretty darn fortunate.\nMy dear R, what the heckers is stopping you from getting that vintage Diorissimo? I can\u2019t snoop around on eBay without stumbling across a whole whack of \u2019em. Go on, you deserve a perfect ounce in one of those tall, curvy crystal bottles, box and all \u2014 and preferably for (relative) peanuts.\nMeanwhile, I\u2019d settle for same of vintage Diorama. I see one for $295. A bit rich for my budget.\nUnsniffed? Amouage Tribute, in a heartbeat.\nNo smelly gifts this year. I gave a wonderful candle from l\u2019Occitane called le Rameau d\u2019Or to a friend last Christmas (Kevin had recommended it, and it\u2019s as fab as he\u2019d said) and my friend promptly asked if he could exchange it for something unscented. (Unscented?? What is the point of an unscented candle, fercryin\u2019outloud??) My balloon of optimism vis-a-vis giving unsolicited scented gifts to anybody but hard-core perfumistas remains deflated.\nJust meant that for all I know, the new stuff isn\u2019t any good!\nAnd I have a very hard time buying vintage. I do spend $ on perfume, but it\u2019s a luxury for me to do so. If I spent even $100 on a vintage bottle and it wasn\u2019t any good, I\u2019d be quite pissed. So not worth it! I want to be as lucky as Angie, and run across these things at garage sales\u2026but it never happens.\nSome perfumistas have all the luck.\nI wouldn\u2019t say no to either a bottle of Amouage Dia or Chanel Cuir De Russie.\nI\u2019m desperate to try Guerlain\u2019s Vetiver Pour Elle and Attrape Coeur so I\u2019d pick either for unsniffed bottles.\nNo plans to give any fragrance related gifts so far but that could still change.\nRobin, have you tried the Diptyque holiday candles? They are lovely. Benzoin is worth getting for the jar alone and I really liked the roasted chestnuts one too.\nAbyss: I have some Attape-Couer I could send you as sample (if you\u2019re in the US, I hope!). Emai me at MUA if you\u2019d like it.\nI haven\u2019t (cheap about candles usually) but Kevin & Pia both bought the Benzoin, and I think they both liked it. Kevin\u2019s going to review it soon.\nDuh\u2026you were making a recommendation, not asking me a question, right? I took it the wrong way. I am thinking about Diptyque, although maybe one of the florals, have you tried any of those?\nI was doing both, really. Out of Diptyque\u2019s florals I used to have Tuberose and those are pretty potent. My favourite was Amber but I think that was a special edition for last year\u2019s holidays. I was given it as a gift and never saw them since.\nThanks, I will think about the Tuberose! I bought a Skeem Jasmine Tea candle and am quite mad that it smells like neither tea nor lavender, so thinking I need to lay out more money and be sure I\u2019m getting something good.\nRobin, the only \u201cfancy\u201d candle I have right now is the Diptyque Tubereuse. The smell is exquisite. Even unlit!\nI\u2019d love to have a full bottle of Creed Virgin Island Water. Just can\u2019t plunk down that much at one time on<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " things that I would love to get for Christmas, or things that I think are great gifts for others (friends, sisters, girlfriends (hint hint Corey)).\n1. Diptyque Feuille de Lavande: I\u2019ve always wanted a Diptyque candle. I just can\u2019t justify spending that much moola on a candle. They\u2019re gorgeous though. The smell is amazing and makes me weak in the knees. I haven\u2019t even smelt this scent before\u2026but lavender is one of my favourite things in this world. The jars are so gorgeous and I love the idea of reusing them as well.\n2. Jo Malone Wild Bluebell Perfume: Another thing that I\u2019ve wanted for a long time. I thought I was gonna get one of these for my birthday but it never came. I love Jo Malone. I often spend about a half hour in Holts smelling each individual perfume, and I have such a hard time picking out which one I like best. The rose perfume that came out at the end of the summer is also a winner.\n3. Vera Bradley Weekend Bag: I\u2019ve always had a bit of a love for Vera Bradley patterns. I had a really tacky Vera Bradley bag when I was younger and a co-worker of mine makes fun of me non-stop for liking the patterns. We can\u2019t get Vera Bradley in Canada, but since I\u2019ve been traveling to the States for work so often I\u2019ve seen a lot of it. I\u2019ve always wanted this large quilted weekend bag, and now that I\u2019ve found that it comes in a plain black colour I love it even more. Perfect for all the travelling I do.\n4. Urban Decay Naked 2: I know that Naked 3 just launched last week, but I\u2019m just not into the pink tones and light colours. I was always really really into the original Naked palette, but I recently decided that Naked 2 was the way to go, plus I just really like the packaging \u2013 a metal snap shut is really much better than fabric and magnets.\n5. Longbourn by Jo Baker: I am a Pride and Prejudice junkie. Everything about the book, the movies, the soundtrack, the version with zombies, the fan fiction, the paraphernalia, etc. etc. I love it all. It is the worlds greatest love story. He was too proud, she was too prejudice. sigh. SO this new book came out recently and it\u2019s on Heathers List (for those of you who don\u2019t know, thats the CEO of Chapter\u2019s reading list) \u2013 The book is about the story of Pride and Prejudice from the point of view of the Bennett family\u2019s servants. Thats gonna be a cool twist. My mom and I are both so excited to read it!\nWhats on your Christmas Wishlist this year?!<|endoftext|>"

Good choice.\nReally like Le Smoking \u2013 great choice!\n5) Guerlain Mitsouko \u2013 Sometimes I wear it and sometimes it drags me around town by my ear.\nI love the Va Va Voom, too. Not something I would have ever purchased, but a friend raved about this one, so I did. It\u2019s a great fig-and-chocolate warm-up for a cold day and despite its silly \u2018Sexiest Fantasies\u2019 tagline and marketing, it\u2019s definitely a delicious fun scent \u2013 and one that\u2019s extremely long-lasting for a body spray.\n#5 made me lol!\n2.Fun,well recently the ELdO\u2019s like Charogne,Fils de Dieu and Vierges et Toreros have been wildly fun to wear!\n3.Sexy:Portrait of a Lady,Bendelirious.In that order.\n4.Relaxing:Guerlain Terracotta,Bronze Goddess or Calyx.\n5.Aspirational:I\u2019m not nearly \u201cclassy\u201d enough to actually pull it off,but Chanel No.18 always makes me feel like \u201cwatch me now,as I enter the room\u201d,like I\u2019m Charlize in a J\u2019Adore ad\u2026Lol!\nahhhh, Iris Poudre\u2026!\nFun: I\u2019m learning to love Dzing!\nRecently bought vintage Chanel no 19 parfum and EDT on eBay and they\u2019re so beautiful.

To me it\u2019s a perfect fall/winter cozy sweater scent but still interesting \u2013 great pick!\nCoco is such a great choice!\nI agree with nozknoz. Coco is sexy.\n2) fun: The MMM Replicas are great fun (if a bit over priced). I\u2019m enjoying my bottle of Lipstick On!\n3) sexy: vintage Samsara!\n4) relaxing: lately, I have found the unpopular in perfumista circles Byredo La Tulipe refreshing and calming. It always cheers me up!\n5) aspirational: one day, I will wear Bandit well. I admire it so, and I am also scared of it, lol!\nLipstick On is really fun!\nI considered saying the same for 5. But SOMETIMES I think I pull it off.\nI\u2019m with you on carrying Bandit off on the right day. I have to work at it though: the clothes, newly cut hair, the right red lippy\u2026life\u2019s quite short to put that kind of effort into living up to a perfume. On the other hand, when I do, I love it!\nI think Patty at Perfume Posse liked La Tulipe.\nHello NST. Just came back from a cinema with my parents, we went to see a new movie with Tom Hanks, \u201cInferno\u201d. I loved it and I was pleased to see its action takes place in Florence, this brought back good memories from when I was there just a month ago.\nCan\u2019t wait to see that film so I can \u201cvisit\u201d Florence!\nJust read \u201cInferno\u201d recently and am really looking forward to the movie. Totally agree on Silver Iris (a desert island perfume for me) and Candy, which my 12-yr-old son loves, too. Haven\u2019t tried the others, but am curious about Boy. Wish I still lived in a city where I could just run out and try things easily.\nGreat to see there is more love for Silver Iris.\nI love Silver Iris too \u2013 it was my wedding scent. And Candy is great fun!\nOMG, how did I miss a new Puredistance? Must find Sheiduna.\nSilver Iris is so beautiful! It would be on my \u201cblack tie\u201d list.\nFingers crossed for allergies, although sometimes I think, if it was a cold, at least I would get over it.\nYes to French Kiss!\n1\u2013go to perfume? Let me count them\u2026.anything gourmand, really, and Black Cashmere.\n2\u2013fun? Most gourmands, especially Ambre Narguile. Oh, and Narcisse Bleu. Also Lyric, but that\u2019s Serious Fun. And Misia, but that\u2019s a whole other story\u2026.\n3\u2013sexy? Aha! The dear one prefers Beloved; I feel wonderful (which is usually the beginning of sexy, when you think about it) in Black Cashmere; many gourmands, especially the syrupy Loukhoum; maybe also Bel Respiro, but that\u2019s an oddity, and Ylang et Vanille. Maybe also Queen of the Night? I\u2019ll think about that.\n4\u2013relaxing? Anything gourmand, plus Ninfeo Mio, L\u2019Ombre dans L\u2019Eau, Narcisse Bleu, Muguet Porcelaine, Bel Respiro and Fate, and Beige..\n5\u2013aspirational? Well, depending what I aspire to at the time, 31 Rue Cambon, Coromandel, 19, Femme, Black Cashmere, Traversee du Bosphore and Cuir de Russie.\nHonestly, I am like you in that I like all genres as well and am open to trying just about anything\u2026.but the appeal of gourmand for me is that they represent \u201ccomfort\u201d and I tend to veer towards sweeter scents when the weather gets really cold.\nI love that your dear one likes Beloved on you! It\u2019s a really gorgeous scent.\nThat\u2019s what I think about Misia. An adult, ladylike scent.\n1. no-brainer / go-to perfume? \u2013 Narciso edp.. just love this one, and it\u2019s a new scent which is the reason I find this perfume hobby so addictive \u2014 just when you think you\u2019ve got your \u201cno-brainer\u201d scent another one comes around to completely sweep you off your feet.\nNarciso is gorgeous.\nHappy weekend everyone! I\u2019m having a total lazy lump day, and not feeling guilty about it at all.\nI think Jicky is sexy, fun, and a no-brainer all at once. It\u2019s so good!\nExcellent Picks!!! I have to get some of the Atelier Ancient Resins\u2026it sounds like my kind of thing, especially this season.\nIt layers nicely too.\nAngel Muse is sexy? Now I REALLY have to try it!!! I don\u2019t think I have anything \u2018sexy\u2019 in my fragrance wardrobe\u2026.\nI also find that pure essential oils are de-stressing and relaxing\u2026frankincense, lavender, patchouli, sandalwood, labdanum, fir needle, cedarwood\u2026..\nIt probably depends on what you find sexy!\nReally curious about DSH Kaleidoscope now. I\u2019m going to have to start carrying Ancient Resins around in my purse.\nHa! Or develop a serious drinking problem\u2026.\nGreat list. EDT or EDP for your Tam Dao?\nEdt, the edp is nice but the rose comes out more in the edt for me. I will eventually seek for a decant of the edp so I can test it out more.\nOh good to know. I\u2019ve only tried the EDP and I can imagine loving a rosier version.\nNice! \nIt\u2019s a fantastic scent, I\u2019ve been wearing it since it launched.\nHave you tried Diptyque\u2019s new Kimonanthe? They\u2019re by no means similar except both share a milkiness (which I really like) except it\u2019s denser in Kimonanthe.\nHello everyone, hope the weekend is going well!\nAspirational? Does not compute.\nLove your number 5!\nYou should figure out how to bottle your sexy perfume. I think i could smell it through your description.\nYour totally slayed it on your \u2018sexy\u2019.\nSOTD is Queen for a Saturday at work that is kicking my a$$. I\u2019m missing all the good swapmeet stuff!!????\nI have a bunch of stuff up, and look forward to the swap meets all year!

        "passage": " definitely a year-round product, and it makes you look alive \u2014 or at least like you just came back from a recent trip. Like, I\u2019m always getting, \u201cGod, Sonia. You\u2019re skin\u2019s so glowy.  So I feel like when someone gives you that kind of compliment\u2026we all strive to look like we just got back from vacation, and I think the Illuminating Bronzer will do that.\nI like applying it with a brush. If you want a lighter application, use my Large Duo-Fibre Brush. I start it on the cheek with a little bit under the cheek to give it more of a hint of contour. Then, around the apples, kind of up into the hairline, and then a slight dusting on the cheek and a light dusting on the neck, so it just looks even. And you have this kind of very fresh-faced, bronzed glow.\nThe thing I love about this bronzer beyond the illuminating factor is that it doesn\u2019t lay down heavy on the skin, so it has this incredible see-through quality.\nI think some people still have this thing about bronzer \u2014 what bronzer was as opposed to what bronzer is today. It has beautiful texture, and you get just radiant skin. A bronzer is definitely what I think must be in everyone\u2019s bag as well.\nYou know, this is going to sound a little bit crazy, and I was like, \u201cDo I even say this?\u201d but I\u2019m going to.\nBecause I am a grown-up \u2014 I have to admit, I am a grown-up \u2014 I\u2019m not such a fan of fillers, but I am a fan of Botox when used correctly. When not overdone, I think of Botox as an age-maintenance tool.\nAnd, I think that what happens with a lot of things in our society and in our life is that things get blown out of proportion, out of control, people misuse products. And I think Botox got kind of a crazy rap because of the extremes that we have seen from so many women. But, I think when used correctly by the right professional, it can maintain and help preserve the appearance of your own skin and really make a big difference with age maintenance.\nWhen speaking to amazing doctors and plastic surgeons, people that I\u2019ve had conversations with, plastic surgeons that in the past who were doing lots of face lifts are no longer doing that because they feel that when they\u2019re maintaining things correctly, they can get such incredible results with age maintenance [with Botox].\nI\u2019m a fan of it when used correctly, and I think,unfortunately, it\u2019s more often than not misused. That\u2019s kind of a tricky thing to get into, but I have to say that it\u2019s an incredible tool, you know, an incredible product, when not overdone.\nDay job/current gig: For my day job I currently work as a business analyst for a Fortune 500 company (it\u2019s in the top 100 within the US). My work covers a diverse range of areas for financial and market analyses. My background has always been in finance. Prior to my current job I completed my MBA in Finance and Marketing.\nHangouts online: thebeautylookbook.com, Instagram, Twitter, and Bloglovin\u2019. I\u2019ve also recently started a lifestyle blog called Styled Notes.\nCurrent favorite product: Diptyque Candles \u2014 any scent! I love re-using them once they\u2019re burned to hold brushes, flowers, pens, etc. They make a beautiful decorative accent for home.\nBeauty inspirations: My favorite local makeup artists from Chanel, the Dolce & Gabbana team from Saks Houston, numerous beauty and fashion bloggers. Fresh cut flowers are always an inspiration for color.\nOne word that best describes your outlook on beauty: That\u2019s hard! I think I see beauty in lots of different things. What I like most about it is playing with the different textures and finishes.\nI can\u2019t live without sheer glossy lipsticks like Chanel Glossimers, YSL Rouge Volupte Shines, Chanel nail polishes and my Edward Bess Daydream Bronzer. I also swear by my Dolce & Gabbana Powder Foundation. Current cult-classic favorites include Chanel Boy, NARS Fez, Armani Eyes to Kill Stretch Lengthening Mascara, Diptyque Baies Candle and Chanel Particuliere Nail Polish.\nI started getting into makeup in high school with Bonne Belle and Jane (mainly clear glosses). I remember my first gloss with color was Wet and Wild Bronzeberry lipgloss (back in the \u201990s). My first beauty splurges were MAC lipsticks in Wuss, Pink Glaze and \u201cO\u201d. I didn\u2019t really get into wearing makeup items other than lips until college.\nI\u2019m rarely successful when it comes to time-saving for beauty. Although when I\u2019m short on time, I use a warmer bronzer as a contour/bronzer/blush. My favorite is Chanel Soleil de Tan (the cream bronzer in the big tub). It goes with anything and gives the face a healthy glow, so you don\u2019t necessarily need blush to brighten your look.\nMy top three beauty tools include my Solano Hair Dryer, Shu Uemura Tweezers and Mason Pearson Detangling Comb.\nThat\u2019s Calvin, but I call him Pumpkin; he\u2019s a ragdoll cat and just turned 1.\nI never knew how to contour until a Trish McEvoy artist showed how to blend in bronzer on the sides of the face in the shape of a \u201c3.\u201d After that \u2014 it made contouring easy!\nRight now I alternate between Dior Purifying Foam Cleanser and SK-II Facial Treatment Cleanser (morning and night). To remove long-wear foundations I use Koh Gen Do first before cleansing.\nI\u2019m in between toners right now. To moisturize I alternate between Le Metier de Beaute Revitalizing Anti-Aging Day Creme and Chanel Resynchronizing. I don\u2019t always use weekly masks or scrubs, but my holy grail face mask is by Koh Gen Do Macro Vintage Essence Mask. It works wonders for your skin, making it baby soft and leaving you truly refreshed and glowing.\nI also use Cle de Peau Eye Cream, but I often neglect eye care (it\u2019s a step I always forget).\nParaffin waxes for hands and feet. The results are amazing but short-lived (and pricey). And they feel pretty weird to me.\nDo you have a trademark look (hair/styling/makeup)?\nI\u2019m a minimalist when it comes to styling. My look is always evolving as I brave bolder colors, but it\u2019s still typically very natural. I\u2019m also rarely without some kind of bronzer.\nOh, yes\u2026 I\u2019ve cut my own hair before (disaster) and had a perm when I was in grade school. Also, multiple times I\u2019ve asked my hair dresser to cut off \u201cone more inch\u201d, only to regret it afterwards.\nNordstrom by far. They have the best customer service and friendliest sales associates, and you can\u2019t beat their free online shipping. I also like shopping at Neiman Marcus and Barneys (perfume heaven). Other favorites include J.Crew, Banana Republic and Sephora.\nKaren at Makeup and Beauty Blog was my inspiration to start blogging back in 2009. She had openings for guest writers, and I submitted an article on Le Metier de Beaute glosses. It was a lot of fun.\nHangouts online: mylucitedreams.com, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nCurrent favorite product: RMS Beauty Oil. NARS Pure Radiant Tinted Moisturizer is a very close second.\nI cannot live without an antioxidant-rich, natural and organic facial oil and serum. I am currently obsessed with RMS\u2019 Beauty Oil. Other absolute musts are the Shiseido Eyelash Curler paired with L\u2019Oreal Voluminous Waterproof Mascara, the only two products that add definition on my otherwise invisible lashes. It Cosmetics Bye Bye Under Eye concealer is the absolute best at concealing my dark under-eye circles with a natural finish. MAKE UP FOR EVER Aqua Liner in Mat Black for my signature cat-eye.\nI have always loved makeup, along with painting, and I found a similarity between the two. I didn\u2019t start wearing makeup until I was 14, and it was just mascara. At 16, I discovered black liquid liner and started to draw a cat-eye, which later evolved into the one I wear today.\nTinted moisturizers and BB Creams are huge time savors for the ease in which they apply, but I never use either as a substitute for skin care or SPF. Also, a multi-use cream blush for both lips and cheeks and everything applied using your fingertips. I recommend spending the most time defining the eye area with mascara and liner.\nThe Shiseido Eyelash Curler.\nWear your SPF. I have diligently worn sunscreen and kept my face out of the sun since I was 18. I am thankful that I did so.\nI have a natural approach to skin care, using only products with natural and organic ingredients. For me, a natural skin care routine has been the most effective. I never, ever fall asleep with makeup on and always properly cleanse and<|endoftext|>"

Their scented candles are just timeless and sumptuous, and that's what they are mostly known for. There is something very iconic about the luxurious perfumery that Diptyque candles are associated with, so of course as you can imagine the skincare line has the most lavish scent! Here I have four products in the sample sizes that I have used a couple of times and now want to share my absolute l-o-v-e.\nFirst of all I love the chic and clean looking packaging, it's simple yet elegant. The scent is just wonderful, if you love roses you will absolute adore the Diptyque skincare. All of these products have this gorgeous rose scent, it's not over-powering however. I find this rose scent quite playful and opulent. Nourishing Cleansing Balm as you can see has a bamly nourishing texture, after massaging it into the skin wash it of with a flannel or just warm water. When it comes in contact with water is just melts away getting rid of all the impurities.\nMulti-Use Exfoliating Clay for the Face has a finely milled texture and it takes cleaning an extra step by exfoliating clogged pores and generally lifting off dead skin cells to reveal a youthful and glowing complexion. Infused Facial Water for the Face is in effect a tonic that soothes the skin that has been thoroughly cleansed and it feels like the most precious rose water. And as the final step I then applied the Protective Moisturising Lotion for the Face, which has a super lightweight texture.\nI have oily/combo acne prone skin and my skin had absolute no problem, on contrary in the morning my skin looked really clear and actually less oily than usual.

        "passage": " In case there are still charges outstanding, I shall draw a veil over an early rose-thieving incident and cut straight to the random selection of items in which the young Neil detected vanilla: Sure deodorant, Lypsyl lip salve and Tic Tacs. Aha - clearly I was asking the wrong person for mints! He went on to experience a vanilla pod-in-pudding epiphany in his early teens, and by 17 he was wearing Calvin Klein Obsession Men and was generally 'obsessed' with body products from that line.\nAnother turning point in Neil's perfume j***ney was his encounter with Shalimar (the potential androgyny of which was amply demonstrated by his friend Peter at university). He also developed a liking for Kenzo Jungle L'El\u00e9phant, undeterred by its sickly sweet character and (to my nose) general weirdness. He even gave it a nickname of 'Nellie the Elephant', and readily admitted to a penchant for'sick bag vanillas'. If this revelation made anyone in the audience a little apprehensive about the selection of scents to come, they hid it well.\nYou really have to be a dedicated lover of perfume to pursue a scent that frankly involves such a lot of careful typing. I initially transposed my 'z' and 'c' for one, and completely forgot the SS, which strangely has nothing to do with steamships, but there you go. I just found one of those acronym lists and am leaning towards the Italian for 'His Holiness' maybe ('Sua Santit\u00e0), as this perfume house has monastic roots. On balance, pobably not 'Steven Spielberg','safe sex' or the 'Scoville Scale' of hotness for chilli - though I am intrigued to learn there is one.\nNeil dubbed this a 'Play-doh cathedral', and while I can't immediately see the link, I have also jotted down 'evocative of miserable Scandinavian themes' (Ibsen, The Bridge, plus every other dark Scandiwegian drama on the telly at the moment featuring good jumpers). Vanilla Marble includes notes of vetiver, patchouli, fig and coconut, with a slight cool, clay-like facet, as well as being reminiscent of 'Bacardi hairspray'. Neil envisioned a stylish woman striding forth in a billowing white dress wearing this one, bats wheeling about her head. It was generally agreed that Vanilla Marble lacked gravitas - and arguably also marbles.\nHow does vanilla make babies?\nThere then followed a fascinating section of Neil's talk where he explained how he and long term partner Duncan had been planning to visit a vanilla plantation in Madagascar (home to the most pukka pod processing practices), but were rather biblically driven back by locusts and ended up in Java (home to more 'fly by night', corner-cutting plantations, but they picked a good 'un). In Java, Neil and Duncan immersed themselves in the production of vanilla, which proved to be a deeply affecting experience for the pair. They literally lived, breathed, slept and sniffed vanilla beans 24/7.\nInteresting nuggets that Neil shared with us about the life cycle of the vanilla plant are the fact that its flower hangs on the vine for 9 months (like humans! - well, I use the term 'vine' loosely). Then the flowers are only open for one day(!), and can only be fertilised by a man wielding a bamboo stick, owing to the demise of a particular Mexican bee that used to do the honours. Oh, and the pods take 5-6 months to be cured. Neil passed round some different varieties of vanilla pod for us to examine and smell: from Madagascar, Uganda etc. My main thoughts were how exceedingly long they were, and how odd their scent was - like some kind of boozy dried fruit. Perhaps Serge Lutens is in fact a closet pod sniffer to have come up with Arabie and the like.\nThis scent contains both Ugandan and Tahitian absolutes, but still managed to smell synthetic like gluey plastic, flat pack furniture, floor polish and cough syrup. Neil dubbed it 'the pod and the plank'. Notwithstanding the alliteration and plosive energy of this pithy phrase, it didn't endear 7 Billion Hearts to me further. Lila felt this one was 'unfinished', which ties in neatly with the flat pack furniture angle, which in my house would remain unfinished and in its many baffling component bits till further notice. Liam of Personal Odour / Odou was reminded of the living museum in our native country of Northern Ireland - the Ulster American Folk Park. I have been gone so long that I know it as the Ulster Folk Museum, but it is the same place and I do remember it. Another audience remember likened 7 Billion Hearts to the aromas given off by the wood in the indoor space of the Globe theatre. Despite a passing interest in culture, this heart is not one of the 7 billion to have been seduced by this scent.\nNext up was Annick Goutal's dreamy feminine fragrance, Songes, which features some heavy-hitting heady florals, namely frangipani, ylang-ylang, tuberose and jasmine. Neil assured us that it had vanilla absolute in the base, which comes out more as the scent wore on, but it did feel like an unusual choice in a vanilla-forward line up. That said, I was glad to be reacquainted with Songes, which I had dismissed early in my own perfume j***ney as headache-inducing, and it was a toss up between this and Vaniglia del Madagascar (of which I did end up getting a sample at the end of the night) as my favourites of the evening.\nNeil memorably described this as 'vanilla for pirates', adding (most amusingly) that it gets off to a 'nervous start'. Vanille has a smoky quality, and includes notes of pepper, incense, ylang-ylang, sandalwood and rum. Neil considered it 'too macho' for himself, but admired it nonetheless. Birgit chimed in to say that she had worn this to calm her nerves during a wrist operation.\nAt this juncture in the evening, we got to debating the character of vanilla generally, and what feelings and sensations it evokes. The word 'vanilla' has latterly been debased to mean 'bland or boring' (as referenced in the title of this post), but the consensus of the group was that vanilla perfumes are at once calming and comforting as well as erotic - 'increasing tumescence in certain regions', as Neil added coyly. Vanilla is mildly addictive and stimulates the production of adrenaline. On the downside, the Japanese hate the smell apparently, which is a bit of a blow considering that Japan is Neil's adopted home. 'The Japanese believe you should be self-effacing at all times and respect other people - be aware of their personal space and not stink up the environment.' Neil is not supposed to wear perfume in the school where he teaches, so gleefully overdoses on the stuff at weekends instead, terrorising people on trains.\nNeil drew our attention to the fruit sherbet in the top of Orchid\u00e9e Vanille, and went on to liken it to 'Saturday night 90s orientals', presumably on account of its slightly bombastic quality. It features rose and violet, almond and chocolate, and Neil assured us that the vanilla in this one gets better and better as time goes on. I did like it a lot, I must say, and Orchid\u00e9e Vanille was the sample Tara chose to take home.\nAtelier's take on vanilla has tangerine and lime in the top notes, and Neil described it further as oaky, 'quite masculine','shadowy and enigmatic' with a 'dark woozy edge' to it. He is personally not a fan of woody notes, so wouldn't wear this one either. Neil agreed with the audience that Vanille Insens\u00e9e wasn't noticeably angry, dubbing it 'passive aggressive vanilla', my favourite quote of the night. That phrase reminded me of a recent conversation with my financial advisor, in which she chided me for having a bunch of high risk investments whose performance I had failed to monitor for years. 'Does that make me a passive aggressive investor?' I inquired. Apparently so.\nOne of the most popular scents passed around on the night, Guerlain's Spiritueuse Double Vanille, includes notes of brandy, cherry, ylang-ylang and pipe tobacco. 'It smells like humming birds', remarked Neil in a sudden access of synesthesia. It was a bit too boozy for me, and a bit too expensive for Neil, costing the equivalent of a Very Material \u00a3280 in Japan.\nHoly Grail vanilla?\nI had recently had occasion to sniff this one, thanks to Val the Cookie Queen of APJ. I was curious to try it following a glowing review by Sandra on Olfactoria's Travels, but though it read on my skin as 'high quality foody vanilla' it was ultimately unsatisfying and rather one-dimensional. I sense I may have been anosmic to the musk which Sandra enjoys in this one. And what this fascinating evening confirmed is that I like my vanillas to have a twist of some sort, like my beloved Diptyque Eau Duelle, for example.\nIn wrapping up, we discussed Neil's proclivity for sweet vanillas and somebody - it may even have been me<|endoftext|>"

Whatever your signature scent may be, weaved through it are ideas and tales that help to create a fragrance that has personality, one that says something. Diptyque, a scent brand beloved for both its candles and its perfumes, puts storytelling at the heart of everything it creates, so unsurprisingly there is more to its latest scent, Eau Capitale, than meets the eye.\n\u201cFragrance is an art, but not always a scented art,\u201d says Olivia Grimaux, global communications director at the brand. \u201c[At Diptyque] it\u2019s a mix of the story, the drawing and the fragrance, which is unique in perfumery.\u201d A visit to the brand\u2019s original store on Paris\u2019s Boulevard Saint-Germain, and the archive above it, confirms this aesthetic trinity \u2013 it\u2019s home to pen-drawn versions of the illustrations seen on each fragrance\u2019s label.\nAmong the old glass bottles that populate the apothecary-style interior are charming stories that make up the history of the cult brand. Like the one behind the La Redoute candle, which smells of cinammon, amber and oranges, and was inspired by a lady called Mrs Merwin, who used to sell her hand-made pot-pourri in the original shop some 60 years ago: \u201cShe also had lots of blackberries, roses and flowers in her garden that she brought to dinners [with the founders, Desmond Knox Leet, Christiane Montadre-Gautrot and Yves Coueslant], scents which were later distilled into the L\u2019Ombre Dans L'Eau scent. Many brands have to moodboard their way to a story, but Diptyque\u2019s rich history means it has a treasure trove of them to dip into.\nThe distinctive labels on each Diptyque perfume start life as hand-drawn sketches that mark the birth of each scent \u2013 and that's before they've even started making the fragrance. \u201cThey always decide on the fragrance story and then draw it. Then, as it evolves, they amend the drawing, so on each label you\u2019ll always see a bit of the story,\u201d says Grimaux. Instead of drawing to fit the oval-shaped sticker on the bottle, the entire narrative is drawn on a much larger piece of paper, then an oval-shaped stencil is moved over the drawing to find what works best visually. It\u2019s an essential step in each perfume\u2019s journey<|endoftext|>"

The creator describes the scent as nocturnal, and it really is. Smelling it, I imagine white petals suggestively opening in the night, greedily drinking the moisture of the dark air...the carnal yet ethereal blossoms slightly sinister in their dazzling whiteness, on the black velvet background of the night sky...\nWe have one 1/2oz jar of Moon Flower to give away. For a chance to win it, please, leave a comment telling us whether you use solid perfumes and which one is your favorite.\nI do have solid perfumes! Those that I own at this moment are AVON Tomorrow, Pacifica Nerola Orange Blossom and Aroma Candle & Scent Co. Honeysuckle. I find that they are very long lasting on my skin. Solid perfume application is a wonderful way to wear a fragrance. You can avoid the over-saturation and overbearing introduction to a scent this way. It gradually warms up with the body and releases that lovely scent as the day goes by.\nThanks for the opportunity! Would love to try this (love the moon flower, I always plant one in my backyard so the moon can shine upon it).\nI do use solid perfumes. My current fav is Pacifica Tahitian Gardenia.\nRoxana Villa's Illuminated Perfume. Q, Sierra Solid Gold, Chaparral...so many beautiful long lasting scents.\nI don't use many solid perfumes, but I do enjoy Pacifica's Tibetan Mountain Temple in solid form even more than the spray. Thanks for the draw!\nI've never used a solid perfume...well, I bought a solid from Pacifica, but I thought it was lip balm - didn't taste too good. I think I tossed it before I realized it was a solid perfume!\nI've never used solid perfumes, and I'm really curious about that.\nI would love a whiff of Moon Flower. The Moonflower Vine is one of my favorite reads (it should be made a classic) and your description of carnal white blossoms against a black velvet sky captures the images conjured in that book. My current -- and only - solid is Waikiki Pikake by Pacifica. Thanks for entering me in the draw!\nI have a small container of my favorite solid perfume, the chypre' Rue Royale by Hove Parfumeur, from New Orleans. My favorite for over 30 years! I also like some of the Crazy Libellule and the Poppies, especially to take to the gym, so I smell nice to me, but no one else gets perfumed out. I have to try some of Providence's offerings, I've heard good buzz!\nI don't do much with solid perfumes, but I like the Pacifica line. Tibetan Mountain Temple is my favorite.\nI don't have many solid perfumes today, but when I was a teenager, I loved the Coty Sweet Earth perfume compacts. I had the \"woods\" one, which I loved.\nAfter I read a positive review of French Lilac I bought a bunch of solids by Pacifica. So far so good. The French Lilac is an exact replica of nature and the California Star Jasmine is euphoric! Solids are more portable which is convenient for reapplying during the day. The perfume stays closer to the skin than a spray, which is nice in summer. I daresay solids last longer in the humidity, but I may be wrong about this. The lower toxicity is a definite plus as well. Who needs more carcinogens and other junk in their system...we have polution for that.\nAndrea Shanti said...\nI do like solid natural perfumes- just now I put on Devotion by c.j. obuchowski. thanks for the giveaway....hope I get to smell it!\nI love solids, especially for travel. My go-to travel perfume is either Sierra Gold or Vera by Roxanna Villa of Illuminated Perfumes. Both are beautiful and comforting. I also use the Miller Harris Tuberose one in it's very cute little pot.\nI have never tried a solid perfume but this one sounds lovely. Thanks for the opportunity to enter the draw.\nI love that picture! I haven't used solid perfumes much-only Satsuma from Basin.\nI have a solid of Diptyque's Philosykos, and I used to have Potion from Lush in a solid.\nThanks for the draw, Moonflower sounds interesting...\nI don't use solid perfumes very often but Charna's new solids sound worth testing. Actually I've been waiting for international shipping to become available on her webstore so I could order some samples. I'd really love to win this draw! Moon Flower is the one I've been especially interested in.\nMimi Gardenia said...\nI am curious about solid perfumes- not really my favorite type of scent but I do think highly of Providence Perfumes! Moon Flower sounds lovely.\nI do have some solid perfumes. Does anyone remember when the Avon Company used to make what they called sachets? Little jars of perfumed cream. As a child, I couldn't leave them alone when visiting my grandmother. I would love to be in the drawing.\nThis unexpected coincidence gave me the shivers, somehow; uncanny echoes across different fields of interest.\nPutting my goosebumps aside, as it were, solid perfumes are great for anyone travelling, and I offer Lush's \"The Oliver Branch\" as my favourite solid perfume travel companion. The little tin lists Bergamot oil, Lemon oil, Orange Flower absolute and Mandarin oil in addition to \"Perfume\", which perhaps explains the gentle revitalising effect using it has on a weary traveller.\nHmmm, long long time since I had a solid although I almost succumbed at Anthropologie just two days ago - a Le Labo...\nThe idea of a solid is a<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "V\u00e9tiver Tonka, an Ellena creation from 2004, is a gourmand vetiver, and since I am in a major gourmand phase right now, this sample finally got its minute in the limelight. Notes include vetiver, neroli, bergamot, grilled hazelnut, dry fruit, cereals and tonka bean.\nVetiver is dominant here, from first spray there is no doubt what this is about, but around the dry and reedy vetiver there is a lovely cloud of hazelnut, tonka bean and wheat packing the distanced and cool vetiver in a soft halo of sweet and yummy notes. Like a cushion those gourmand notes serve to make vetiver comfortable and comforting for me.\nV\u00e9tiver Tonka is perfectly balanced in every respect: warm versus cool, dry versus sweet, edible versus inedible, feminine versus masculine. V\u00e9tiver Tonka occupies the coveted middle ground where everything is just right. The more I wore V\u00e9tiver Tonka, the more I liked it. It is refreshing and cooling on a hot day, as well as providing me with the sensation of deliciousness without being foody. It is unobtrusive, but has a greater presence than most other Hermessences. It holds up much better too. Wear time is about six hours which is unheard of among the rest of the line, as much as I like them, long wearing they are not.\nThis is not a perfume that inspires me to great flights of fancy, but \u2013 on the contrary \u2013 seems to center me, it makes me aware of the necessity to put both feet on the ground and move. It enables me to clear my head and focus on things that have to be done, on the mundane tasks that might not be glamorous or demanding of intelligence, but have to be done anyway. V\u00e9tiver Tonka brings out my efficient and practical side, and that is something I really need sometimes and therefore highly appreciate.\nV\u00e9tiver Tonka gets things done.\nThis entry was posted in Fragrance Reviews, Gourmand, Green, Herm\u00e8s, Woods and tagged Fragrance, Gourmand, Hermes, Hermessence, Jean-Claude Ellena, Perfume, Review, Vetiver, Vetiver Tonka. Bookmark the permalink.\nAnd Tonka beans are a much beloved ingredients of mine when cooking (aaah, Tonka Creme Brulee\u2026). I quite tend to neglect Hermes (the very simple reason for that : I just can\u2019t afford to like it, really\u2026), but recently somewhere this very Vetiever Tonka was jumping into my face (unfortunately it was on the www only, quite a cyber-tempting) \u2013 so \u201cto be tested\u201d was etched in my brain.\nYour review made this etching only more dominant and urging, dear Birgit.\nOne more agreeing note : yes, Vetiver has that \u201ccentering\u201d effect on me as well \u2013 one of the reasons I like/need it that much.\nIt is certainly worth testing, if vetiver is your thing, chances are good you\u2019ll like this one.\nThis was the first Hermessence I tried, and still my favorite. I toggle between vetiver and patchouli as my centering scents, and this is a great version of the former. This blend keeps the vetiver from becoming sharp on my skin, for which I\u2019m thankful, and the tonka gives it a homey twist.\nDid you try all of the Hermessences, Jen?\nI haven\u2019t met Brin de Reglisse, Osmanthe Yunnan, or Paprika Brasil. I love lavender but not licorice, tea notes give me a headache a lot of the time, and nothing has compelled me to try Paprika Brasil, so far.\nVetiver Tonka is my favorite of the Hermessence line, and it is the one fragrance that my husband will ask me to wear. I only have a decant now, but it is enough because I save it for special occasions. Unfortunately the special occasions don\u2019t seem to happen too often anymore with 3 children! I do want to try the new L\u2019Artisan Vetiver to see if it could be an everyday vetiver for me.\nDo you mean Coeur de Vetiver Sacr\u00e9 or the vetiver from the Mon Num\u00e9ro collection? The latter is extremely masculine and very far from the Hermes. Coeur is more of a gourmand vetiver too.\nThe Coeur de Vetiver Sacre is the one that I want to try. Your review pushed me to it! I now have a large sample order in my cart at Luckyscent and at the Perfumed Court, and I may never catch up at this rate. I am in a gourmand stage again myself. I used to love fluffy vanilla fragrances until they just got too sweet for me, but now I want vanilla again \u2013 but less sweet. Diptyque Eau Duelle and Atelier Vanille Insense are winners so far. Vetiver Tonka fills a spot for me as a gourmand type fragrance without the dessert association. Thanks for the wonderful reviews!\nI would love to hear how you like the L\u2019Artisan!\nParfumerie Generale also makes wonderful gourmands that are not heavy.\nI love the Parfumerie Generale line, but I am a bit behind in sampling. The newest ones sound lovely. I personally wouldn\u2019t turn down a single bottle from the line. L\u2019Ombre Fauve is one of my favorites as well as Bois Blond. And Cadjmere. I even like the strange Psychotrope.\nI will get that sample of Coeur Sacre de Vetiver this weekend. And I really need to find samples of the Mon Numero series! I just can\u2019t keep up.\nWhat is interesting to me, is that I never really know what is going to set me all aflame with desire\u2014 turns out, \u201cgourmand vetiver\u201d is it. Lot\u2019s of things have caught my interest of late (Honour, the Parfums d\u2019Empire scents, etc), but none until this moment inspired me to leave the page half-way through a comment, and buy 8mL (which I just did)!\nSo gourmand vetiver got to you, I could have snet you some, but sometimes it has to be right now, I totally understand!<|endoftext|>"

I love gift sets because you usually get some full sized products along with deluxe/travel size products. It's really one of the best ways to get a feel for the brand and it helps you decide if you want to splurge on the full-sized versions! A lot of these products I've used and loved or I really want to try out. I also want to mention that Bloomingdales is having their Private Sale where you can take $25 off of every $100 on a large selection of items AND loyallists can get a $25 reward for every $100 spent on a larget selection of items. They even offer free shipping! Annnd you can use Ebates too to earn some extra cash! Seriously, Bloomies is the best!\nI've only ever heard amazing things about the supermud mask. It's a clay mask that is supposed to help clear up blemishes and get rid of congested pores. I tried a sample of this a few months ago and I used it as a spot treatment on my breakouts. It worked so well for that! The reviews on Sephora are really good so if you have acne prone skin give it a try!\nLet me just say that their moisturizing soft cream is amazing! It is SO moisturizing but not heavy. It works so well under makeup and makes my skin look plump and glowy. I looove it! Apart from the moisturizing soft cream this set also includes their cleansing foam, revitalizing hydrating serum, and the eye concentrate, which I've really wanted to try!\nI've never tried anything from this brand but I've always read great things about it! Their treatment mask is supposed to be good for long flights and celebs and supermodels swear by it! I've also heard a lot about their treatment essence. It balances out your skin to improve texture and moisture.\nThis set comes with the super loved rose mask and 3 travel sized products, including their micellar water. The mask says it smoothes, plumps, and brightens the skin. I really love any product that makes my skin feel and look plump because it gives my skin a youthful glow.\nTHIS gift set is on my wishlist. It includes so many amazing products for the price that I'm honestly surprised it's not sold out yet. It includes a Kevyn Aucoin volume mascara, a mini Oribe dry texturizing spray, a gold glitter Smith & Cult nail polish (perfect for holidays!), Sunday Riley good genes treatment, an Eve Lom cleanser, a Lipstick Queen frog prince lipstick, and a By Terry baume de rose crystalline lip balm. A $233 value all for under $100!\nThe two products I want to try from this set are the full sized lip cheat in the shade pillow talk and the magic cream.\nThese MAC mini lipsticks come in 3 different colors to choose from - cool, warm or pink.\nAnother lipstick mini complete with a nude, pink and red shade!\nDon't these nail polish colors just scream holidays! It comes with a nude, glitter, and wine color - the only colors you really need this fall & winter.\nI had to include this in here because it's one of my favorite fragrances. It's a feminine and fresh scent that doesn't feel overpowering like other Chanel perfumes. The best part is it lasts all day long with just one spritz. This gift set comes with the 3.4 oz bottle and an additional travel size perfume to throw in your bag.\nIf you've never tried Charlotte Tilury this would be a great introductory set. It comes with everything you need to complete a whole makeup look. I love all the colors in this specific set but if you don't they have a lot more options to choose from.\nThis gift set is also on my wishlist. Diptyque candles are just gorgeous and look great on display. Their empty glasses also work great to hold makeup brushes or bobby pins depending on the size. This is a 12 mini candle set so they are the 1.2 oz size. It is definitely worth it if you want to find your favorite scent from Diptyque compared to this set of 5 minis for $75.\nI love YSL lipsticks. They're the best and the packaging is just gorgeous! This set comes with their best selling red lipstick, a full size mascara and a sample size of the super popular touche elcat blur primer.\nThis little set is the perfect way to find your favorite Jo Malone fragrance! It comes with lime basil & mandarin, english pear & freesia, nectarine blossom & honey, english oak & redcurrant, and wood sage & sea salt.  The only scents I've tried are oak & red currant and wood sage & sea salt and they are both so lovely and fresh.\nThese are lovely gift guides dear! I think I'd get myself the MAC mini lipstick set. ha!<|endoftext|>"

What fragrance are you wearing?\nI'm powdered again, in Prada Infusion d'Iris Absolue.\nReminder: this Friday, 16 October, we'll do Powder Puff Friday: wear something powdery!\nNote: top image shows the Prada Saffiano Print Butterfly Satchel Bag, $2500 at Neiman Marcus.\nThanks to the generous & indefatigable hajusuuri, who sent a sample of BdI extrait with my splitmeet purchase, testing that vs. my sample of the edt. The edt does feature, as AnnS described, a sort of woody astringency not apparent in the edt. It\u2019s really strange\u2013sometimes the edt disappears quickly, and other times, I\u2019ll catch whiffs the next morning. The parfum is plusher & less aldehydic, a bit sweeter. Both have their own charms. I\u2019ve enough left to layer them for my next experiment.\nBois des \u00celes?\nI agree with you how the EdT seems to disappear, but it actually turns into the creamy sandalwood. The floral jasmine, neroli, and ylang ylang disappear along with the aldehydes, but what lingers for a long time is the creamy base. The parfum is smoky, plush, and creamy. It just stays like that forever!\nYou probably won\u2019t even think it is all that funny, but it was a triumph\u2013 of me over my lack of tech sophistication, my search engine and there being too much data in the world\u2013that I found it!!!!!\nThe IT triumph. Ahhahahah Actually, the \u2018niiiice haul\u2019 part actually struck a chord with me the most! I am in that category, clearly.\nAnyway, I have not seen it until now. The response notification did not popped up in my email at all :;S even if someone did reply. I have to check more often.\nHi Nick! I didn\u2019t realize who you are here? Or whatever, but suffice to say that I binged myself on about 15+ of your reviews last winter one evening when I stumbled upon you guys on Youtube. Awesome stuff \u2013 I particularly enjoyed the boxer dropper reviews \u2013 looking at you Alien. Cheers!!\nBoxer droppers?! Sign me up!\nNick \u2013 sorry \u2013 I thought that link above was taking us to your site. Those fragrancebros are very funny anyway. My bad!\nI\u2019ve just realised that I did not click on the subscription!\nTerrific! So glad you found it.????\nI am so happy that it helped. I like to check out my favorite perfume reviewers on You Tube after I\u2019ve read my favorite blogs. BTW, I finally caved for a fb of BDI perfume as my sample was almost gone. I actually felt a bit panicked. It is so beautiful! I like to dab on the perfume and then layer it with the EDT. Hopefully, I\u2019m not making my coworker\u2019s eyes water.????\nI suspect the layered combo will be my preferred iteration!\nInteresting. Thanks for giving us that comparison of the two.\nThanks for the shout-out and glad you were able to do a comparison!\nComfort for the cold. Arm-length sillage that does not disturb neighbouring cubicles.\nOn a side note, I have managed to haul 4 little vials of Joy, Jicky, Foug\u00e9re Royale, and First after telling the SA that \u2018I am in the Classic Phase\u2019. I did not dare ask for Miss Dior, Quelques Fleur, Shocking, or L\u2019Air du Temp, but I should have! What is there to lose, anyway.\nWell played, Nick!\nA brand I have never tried. I think.\nNever smelled the perfume, but the name is fun to say out loud!\nNO. 19 today, was in need of some spine stiffening for my driving lesson this morning. Mingling nicely with wafts of Silver Iris on my jumper from yesterday. Excited about my almost full bottle of L\u2019air de Rien that\u2019s due to arrive today!\nGood luck with the lesson! I have a license to fly a plane..BUT NOT TO DRIVE.\nThanks!, flying a plane-that must feel incredible.\nReally? I am impressed!\nI\u2019m a student driver myself! And trying to learn in NYC no less. Hoping to get my license before year\u2019s end. Does this #19 help?\nThis is to answer your question about the oud in Oud Palau. The oud is a little bit sharp and noticeable on me when I first spray. But it quickly settles into a slightly boozy leather with a bit of tobacco in there. And there is also a smidgen of camphor and some rose. It isn\u2019t a sweet perfume on me, I get more spice, wood and rose, but it is understated. It actually reminds me a little bit of Amouage Lyric only not as hefty. The oud is present but the perfume overall is so well blended that it plays nicely with the other notes. I hope that helps.\nI got a 2ml sample from STC and it\u2019s great but not something I really love. If it sounds interesting to you, I can send it your way.\nSOTD is Oud Palau!\nThe dry down is a little sweeter and a bit powdery anchored by some patch. There seems to be a sort of skank note coming through, not sure what it is but reminds me a little of civet.\nThanks!!! I have always respected Lyric, but I don\u2019t enjoy wearing it. For some reason it gets way too \u201cthick\u201d for me? I don\u2019t know, but something like Lyric lite sounds good. What you are saying also makes me think of Paestum Rose \u2013 ish? Definitely sounds test worthy. I like Diptyque a lot and am always hankering to try more.\nI actually had to look up what exactly powdery meant in fragrance speak. I then realised that I have quite a few powdery fragrances in my collection. Today\u2019s choice is Divine\u2019s L\u2019Inspiratrice, which, if my memory serves me right, is described as powdery in Perfumes The Guide. I think of it as a soft patchouli rose myself.\nHmm.. powdery conjures an image of iris, sheer floral in the background, or hay, or coumain, or not-so-sweet vanilla to me.\nI didn\u2019t quite know what it meant to me, or what it meant in general. Fortunately BoisdeJasmin has a very clear description.\nfor me, pretty much anything with tonka bean smells powdery,. I have to look up the definition in BdJ. By my own definition of powdery, I have many in my collection.\nMy first conscious encounter with powder was when I tried Teint de Neige. The only fragrance to make me feel nauseous.\nBut lots of fragrances classified as powdery are great favourites, so there you go.\nSummer hasn\u2019t quite let go here in Denver (will be 85 today), so I am still enjoying my warm weather scents. Today it\u2019s Berdoues Assam of India, my cheerful, bright, can\u2019t-go-wrong lemon tea fragrance.\n\nSeriously considered blind buying that, but I think I\u2019ve done that enough lately. I bet it smells lovely on you though.\nI need to try that! Last I checked it was on clearance. Sounds perfect for fall.\nI\u2019ve developed a bit of a cold in the past two days, but I can still smell a bit. When I was at my coughing, whiny worst last night, I decided to put on a bit of my dabber sample of Jean Scherrer, because in my hazy brain something green seemed like the \u201chealthy\u201d choice. It did make me feel better even as I laughed at myself.\nInfusion d\u2019Iris today, which my wonky sniffer is currently interpreting as too sweet (?) but that\u2019s ok.\nUgh, get better! And that is funny, but who knows, the power of suggestion can\u2019t hurt.\nExactly. Thanks Robin!\nHope you get well soon Ihadanidea, I often put on Jungle Elephant when I have a cold, it works a bit like Vicks Vaporub (if that is a known reference, it is a mentholated topical cream that is rubbed on the chest).

The brand\u2019s signature scents of jasmine, sandalwood and bergamot are just the cherry on top.\nAcqua di Parma\u2019s Rosa Nobile Hair Mist will appeal to lovers of rose fragrances. The Best of Beauty winner infuses a soft floral scent to hair. A conditioning agent in this formula makes hair feel silky smooth. It doesn\u2019t smell too much like a garden, as the cedarwood and musk notes rise to the surface once the perfume dries.\nIt\u2019s hard to find a better way to smell like Byredo\u2019s Mohave Ghost perfume eau de parfum. It smells just like Byredo\u2019s Mohave Ghost Hair Perfume for less than $100. This fragrance is inspired by the flowers that thrive in the Mohave Desert. The woody, musk base makes the floral notes pop. For an immersive experience, pair this fragrance with the regular perfume.\nThe oil-mist combination is packed with nourishing gooseberry, squalane, and fruity, floral fragrance for light, yet effective hydration.\nMatthieuCosse\u2019s illustration on the Diptyque Ilio Hair Mist bottle is stunning. But we all know that the French perfume house doesn\u2019t slack when it comes down to fragrances. This floral scent is light and airy with notes of prickly pears and iris that will transport you to the Mediterranean coast.\nThe Aussie Lustr Shine Enhancing hair Perfume is the perfect choice for glossy hair. This spray deposits a subtle, universally-flattering shimmer and coats the hair with its manuka honey-infused formula for glass-like, shiny hair.\nMaison Francis Kurkdjian Paris Baccarat Rouge Rouge 540, another TikTok favorite, is also available as a hair fragrance. The matching Scented Hair mist is just as elegant and decadent as the original. This mist is still full of cedar, saffron and amber notes, but in a subtler form. It moves with your hair and doesn\u2019t seem too over-the-top.\nYou read that correctly: The TikTok-famous, hard to pin-down perfume Juliette Has a Gun is also available in body and hair mist forms. The scent of this formula is similar to its musky sibling, eau de parfum. However, it\u2019s not alcohol-free and has a subtler scent. For an olfactory experience that is all yours, the warm woody notes found in the bottle combine with your natural scent to create a unique fragrance.\nThere are too many options. But that is not the case for Pacifica\u2019s Body and Hair Mists. These mists are alcohol-free and vegan, and come in over 20 unique scents.

        "passage": " Architecture: Experiencing Places through the Sense of Smell, is one of many experts predicting the humble nose will soon play a greater role in our homes, workplaces, public spaces and retail zones. Perfumers and architects already share a common vocabulary, she says: the former enthuse about a scent's structure, weight and warmth, while the latter ponder a building's ambience, memories and emotions.\nBritish architect Usman Haque, who designs smell-based technologies to enhance the mood of rooms, agrees. A few decades ago architects saw lighting as a luxury; now it's become a central aspect of spatial design. Scent is now following suit, he says, and will increasingly be used to draw out the sensual elements of both public and private spaces.\nWhat makes smell so powerful? Humans can recognise close to 10,000 aromas, and we breathe about 30,000 times a day. Smells are processed by the limbic system, an old area of the brain relating to memory and emotion. While responses differ across individuals, cultures, genders and age groups, certain scents can spark vivid feelings and recollections: the summery smell of cut grass (childhood holidays), the cloying odour of eugenol (the horrors of the dentist), a whiff of your ex's favourite shampoo (fond memories or heartache, depending on how things ended).\nOur love of pleasant scents, argues Barbara, is the flipside of darker impulses: the fear of death and decay, and our aversion to the muck and mess of bodily functions.\nWhile we've often dismissed it as a primitive remnant of our cave-dwelling past, there are signs we're rediscovering our sense of smell. Supermarket aisles are packed with a growing array of air fresheners, home deodorisers and scent dispensers. US company Demeter sells a range of home fragrances, including Wet Garden, Never Lonely, Between the Sheets and the Christmas-themed Egg Nogg.\nThe ancient art of aromatherapy is also enjoying a boom, with essential oils being used in millions of homes. The typical blend names - relax, energise, focus, harmony, romance - suggest the moods we want to conjure up in our private realms. These generalised names carry many possible subtexts: \"It's been a rough day\"; \"What say we tidy this place up?\"; \"I'm trying to study\"; and \"Turn off the footy, I'm feeling frisky...\".\nBut it's the retail world that's leading the pack in the more sophisticated uses of aroma. Smell is a powerful hidden persuader, and many businesses are using \"ambient scenting\" to influence our shopping behaviour.\n\"It's about creating a multi-dimensional emotional connection. Smell has very powerful emotional links and it works almost instantly,\" says Monash University's Michael Morrison, a global expert in \"emotional branding\", an emerging field in which aroma plays a major role.\nRecent studies show the careful use of scent, combined with lighting, music and store layout, can affect the way we shop, says Morrison. Pleasant smells shorten our perception of time, create positive associations, cheer up staff, and make us likely to browse longer, impulse buy, spend more and visit again.\nWhile these aromatic discoveries are new, the basic principles are not. \"Fragrance has been used for thousands of years to excite, arouse and tantalise,\" says Mark Gordon, marketing manager of fragrance specialist Ecomist. \"Bakers in the 1960s would place fans near the ovens to push the smell out into the street and entice people in. We've just advanced technologically on that idea... You could call us the Pied Piper of aromas.\"\nThe company's in-house Parisian perfumer, Yves Dombrowsky, has developed 180 fragrances which can be diffused through homes or shops with a small computerised dispenser. Gordon likens it to a high-tech offshoot of aromatherapy, minus the burning candles. Two of Ecomist's niche scents - the floral/spice mix Ronan, and the seaspray/citrus blend Ozone - have proved popular in display homes; surf shops go for the Mango blend, while cafes prefer Blueberry Muffin.\nAustralia has been relatively slow on the uptake, but aroma marketing is gaining ground. Morrison has worked with fashion chain Supre to study the combined effects of music and scent. The conclusion? For Supre's target market (teens and young women), a mix of vanilla-scented air and loud dance music does wonders at the till.\nGodwin Hili chose one of Ecomist's mixes, a subtle greenish woody aroma, as a signature scent for his Little Collins Street fashion boutique, Godwin Charli.\n\"I chose the scent because it's natural, fresh and welcoming, and it creates a sense of nostalgia and comfort.\" Hili's parents were in the tailoring business, and the shop's rustic feel aims to evoke that sense of heritage: \"We only opened two months ago, but lots of customers think we've been here 50 years.\"\nGlobally, the profit power of smell has infiltrated the realms of gambling, education, pop culture, fashion, interior design and the internet. When a Las Vegas casino pumped a floral scent into its slot machine area, gamblers spent 45% more. A US children's museum recently ordered a \"dinosaur dung\" aroma, and researchers are exploring the use of scent in schools and hospitals to improve learning, treat phobias and speed recovery. Singer Shania Twain has released a daffodil-scented \"fragrance disk\", and British designer Jenny Tillotson's jewellery dispenses a lavender aroma if the wearer becomes anxious. You can buy alarm clocks that emit a coffee scent, curtain fabrics embedded with tiny perfume capsules, and a gadget that lets you sniff products online, or concoct and email your own scents.\nWith the growth of aroma marketing, cynics may worry that Big Brother is no longer merely watching us: he's now sniffing out our deepest desires and selling them back to us in olfactory form. So is there anything shady about the subliminal link between dollars and scents?\nWhile he admits we're not far off the personalised advertising scenarios depicted in sci-fi film Minority Report, Morrison sees no need to worry: \"I don't see any problem: we don't have to stay in a space if we don't like it. It's also becoming more interactive. In some Hong Kong hotels you can select a particular smell for your pillow. The consumer has control.\"\nBesides, he adds, there's a trend towards the use of ambient scenting in private spaces. \"In today's homes we have the cooking zone, the sleep zone, the parents' zone, the kids' zone... I see no reason why in future we won't be using different lighting and aromas in each of those zones to create a particular mood.\"\nTop 10 scents to make you...\nNote: Individual memory plays a role. If you've had a traumatic experience involving vanilla, you probably won't find that smell pleasant.\nLead image: Large natural linen tablecloth $300, from Est; Toile lavender scented cushion, $55, from Est; Trio of hand rolled soaps, $6 each, from Est; Wooden tree, $75, scented linen heart, $18, both from Est; Cote Bastide Amber crystal pot purer, $49 small, $75 large, from Kleins, pictured in ceramic dish, $20, from Husk; Mathias Figue (Fig) candle, $75, from Peony; Cinnamon stirring sticks, $24.90, from Husk; Diptyque Feu de Bois (Firewood) candle, part of gift set of three, $149, from Peony; Mathias hand blown perfume bottle, fragrance and dispersing reeds, $169, from Peony; Diptyque Baies (Bulgarian Rose and Blackcurrant) limited edition candle, $95, from Kleins; Mathias Rose d'Antan Soap petals, $99, from Peony; Mathias Figue (Fig) home fragrance, $59, from Peony; S M Novella room spray, $95, from Manon bis; Marble pears, $28 each, from Husk.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Green. I\u2019ve said it before and I say it again, Berlin is very green. Trees everywhere, offering lots of shade and making the urban air somewhat breathable. If I were in charge, meaning if I were either God or Donald Trump, cars would be forbidden altogether. Except maybe for Aston Martins, Bentleys, and la d\u00e9esse. But that\u2019s a completely different story. Anyway, on a hot summer\u2019s day, Berlin\u2019s trees provide enough shade for strollers and flaneurs to survive global warming, its architecture offers some diversion, and in the same spirit, its restaurants are contributing some nice sunshades to dine under.\nWhen in Paris, it\u2019s one of my strange habits to have the first coffee in the day in the Marais, don\u2019t ask me why, there are perfectly fine alternative locations all over Paris, but no, it has to be the Marais, Paris\u2019s oldest quarter, you won\u2019t find much of Haussmann\u2019s architecture here, it\u2019s filled with beautiful h\u00f4tels particuliers, the residences of the aristocracy, erected hundreds of years ago, and still teaching us lessons about grandeur, in comparison, the front door of Mrs Kennedy\u2019s lodging on Park Avenue appears to me like the back entrance to a dubious embassy of a totalitarian country with a laughable gross national product, sorry, New York, and don\u2019t get me started on Trump and his golden tower, anyway, the Rohans and consorts had much better housing, one of those palaces, that\u2019s what these h\u00f4tels particuliers really are, palaces, now houses the Picasso Museum. Then there\u2019s Place des Vosges, a clich\u00e9, I know, but I have to pay it at least one visit each time I\u2019m there, it actually looks nicest off season, in January, early in the year and in the morning, on a frosty day, void of people and tourists, under light snow, when only birds have left their prints, I like it in the rain, too, a little morbid, but I rather hate it when it\u2019s full of people in summer, people with too much time on their hands ruin everything, loitering with intent, thirsty for a tan or whatever they do on a lawn \u2013 I do sound misanthropic, don\u2019t I? Don\u2019t get me wrong, I like people. Just not in places that look better without.\nIt was one of the windiest days ever, and after enjoying some serious sky-sightseeing, I ended up being hit by a brutal sandstorm, the sand probably coming from one of the numerous construction sites. I breathed in some of it, and I can assure you, it didn\u2019t taste all too good. Hours later, some sand would still trickle from my hair, until I took a shower and clogged the drain for good. But it was all worth it, never had I seen a more dramatic sky over Berlin.\nAn Olympic snowman.\nOn the first day of snow this year\u2014which was last Saturday, to be quite precise\u2014I decided to see Berlin\u2019s Olympiastadion for the very first time in my life. It was strange to see it there, lying still in the outskirts of this buzzy town, covered in light snow, not much seems to have changed since 1936, the Olympians of that year are all gone, Jesse Owens being the best of them all, teaching the Third Reich a lesson by being decorated with four gold medals, each one unquestionable proof that Hitler (like so many others\u2026 ) was wrong about white supremacy. The architecture of the place, however, is flawless, puristic art deco at its best, flanked by lithic, never ageing athletes. I went home smiling, a young girl\u2019s little snowman in front of the gigantic, sky scraping gate, had put my mind at ease.\nBerlin\u2019s high toned places.\nParis in 1958 was very different from today, from the Paris I know. First of all, it was so very dirty. It was none other than Andr\u00e9 Malraux, de Gaulle\u2019s guy for everything cultural, who had all the blackened historic fa\u00e7ades cleansed, he wanted Paris to be the City of Lights again, the most important operation in urban architecture since Baron Haussmann changed the face of Paris altogether in the 1850s and \u201960s, and there was quite some dirt that had laid up since then, believe you me (and by me, I mean my mother, she should know, she did live in Paris in the early 1960s). Second of all, one of my favourite areas, the Marais, was considered a troubled district, it was quite run down in those days, don\u2019t imagine you\u2019d have found any of today\u2019s fashionable caf\u00e9s and restaurants there, no art galleries, no stylish designer stores, no perfumed air emerging from the Guerlain and Diptyque boutiques, certainly no gays, not even closeted ones, instead you would find a butcher right on Place des Vosges, just like in Jean Delannoy\u2019s 1958 movie \u201cMaigret Sets A Trap\u201d, and a butcher who let you witness his bloody business through his shop windows at that. It was a different time, one might say, I say it was a better time \u2013 or more precisely, it was a more authentic time, a time where there was not yet a Louis Vuitton store between the Flore and the Deux Magots to please people suffering from logomania in every possible spot, or otherwise Simone de Beauvoir would have had to look for another place to work and have her p\u2019tit noir. By the way, neither she or Jean-Paul Sartre were very fond of Malraux, trop r\u00e9ac politically, and I think, she might have sensed the side-effects that Malraux\u2019s polishing of Paris would bring. Who knows? Luckily, she died long before the Louis Vuitton people opened their store on Boulevard Saint-Germain.\nI really wanted to show you Berlin on a sunny day, alas, Berlin and I weren\u2019t blessed with a blue sky. So, once again, I give you Berlin on a cloudy day. That way, at least, the elegant greys and beiges of the town are pointedly marked and wonderfully emphasised. Enjoy!\nFashion on the road.\nThe eye has to travel, so said Diana Vreeland once, and Gleb Derujinsky followed that instruction of hers quite literally. His fashion photography for Harper\u2019s Bazaar did not take place in a studio, with perfect lighting, and a bar-tabac or a diner nearby that comfort zone, but outside in the world, in the streets, in the urban and not so urban jungle, his eyes travelled everywhere, and as much as we might know some of the locations, let\u2019s face it, we\u2019ve all strolled along the Seine and took shots on or under its bridges, some of Derujinsky\u2019s destinations I have yet to discover myself, like the wine cellars of Maxim\u2019s, I haven\u2019t even ordered a steak au poivre there yet, nor have I been to the Nara Deer Park in Japan with its thousand-year-old trees. This photographer demanded a passport from his models and broke boundaries all over the world, he took them to nature, you\u2019re born free, he seems to say, so act on it. Sometimes you can\u2019t tell whether you\u2019re looking at some exotic scenery in an old issue of National Geographic or at Lanvin-Castillo\u2019s ideas for the next summer. With \u201cCapturing Fashion\u201d, Flammarion and Derujinsky\u2019s daughter Andrea make our eyes travel over and over again, I just hope they won\u2019t suffer from jet lag.\nBerlin in winter.\nIt\u2019s cold, obviously. You see, the nearer you get to Russia, the colder it gets. And I\u2019m not referring to the post-communistic and neo-capitalistic allure of Putin\u2019s empire, just to Siberia\u2019s increasing proximity. And it\u2019s windy, too, although I don\u2019t have a geographical (or political) explanation at hand for that. It\u2019s definitely not a comfy town to visit, but the Berliner Schnauze will make up for it: Berliners are all very grounded, and everybody grounded is to be trusted, aren\u2019t they? Just make sure to wear woolen socks when visiting.<|endoftext|>"

From C\u00e9line's Hollywood love letter to Saint Laurent's historic Rodeo Drive renovation, our city must have a certain je nais se quoi that keeps designers and retailers from the tastemaking country coming back for more.

Well, between that and the Queen's speech, there wasn't much of a contest I'm afraid.\nSo where are the best bargains to be had? The big department stores seem to have very similar bits and pieces in their online sales this year - it's almost like they're all coming from the same big warehouse or something. Hmm. There are a few notable exceptions though...\nBoots have lots of perfume gift sets as usual, and they've also done their usual thing of reducing all their stickered Christmas gifts by half. My picks would definitely be among the Poppy King for No 7 gift range, especially this gorgeous little red lip palette reduced to a bargainous \u00a35. It's currently sold out online, but keep an eye out for it in store and with any luck the site will replenish its stock too.\nThere are also some very cute mini No 7 nail polishes to be snaffled up (\u00a35 for a set of 5), and of course Boots is the place to go for all the discounted Soap & Glory gifts you can shake a pink retro-themed stick at.\nThe one to nab at Debenhams is absolutely the Urban Decay Book of Shadows IV, reduced to \u00a336.80 (was \u00a346). Did they order too much stock this year? They also have some steep discounts on This Works sets, and don't forget to check their offers on The Sanctuary if your local Boots has run dry of the set you want.\nYou can also expect to find lipsticks and eyeliners from Chantecaille and By Terry at half price (Chantecaille lipstick for a tenner? Yes please) and a very tempting gift set of 3 candles from Diptyque reduced from \u00a360 to \u00a330.\nWith only 30% discount on their beauty sale, ASOS aren't tempting us as much as they might, but there are some good value Frederik Fekkai, Bliss and Paul & Joe seasonal sets that are worth a look if you particularly like those brands. I'm very very keen on these Manhattan collection palettes, \u00a322 (were \u00a330), which contain eyeshadow, blush and highlighter in a white Art Deco style case.\nHave you found any unmissable bargains in the sales?

        "passage": "I'm so excited to share my first holiday gift guide with you all! The focus of this one is highly rated luxe beauty product gift sets. I love gift sets because you usually get some full sized products along with deluxe/travel size products. It's really one of the best ways to get a feel for the brand and it helps you decide if you want to splurge on the full-sized versions! A lot of these products I've used and loved or I really want to try out. I also want to mention that Bloomingdales is having their Private Sale where you can take $25 off of every $100 on a large selection of items AND loyallists can get a $25 reward for every $100 spent on a larget selection of items. They even offer free shipping! Annnd you can use Ebates too to earn some extra cash! Seriously, Bloomies is the best!\nI've only ever heard amazing things about the supermud mask. It's a clay mask that is supposed to help clear up blemishes and get rid of congested pores. I tried a sample of this a few months ago and I used it as a spot treatment on my breakouts. It worked so well for that! The reviews on Sephora are really good so if you have acne prone skin give it a try!\nLet me just say that their moisturizing soft cream is amazing! It is SO moisturizing but not heavy. It works so well under makeup and makes my skin look plump and glowy. I looove it! Apart from the moisturizing soft cream this set also includes their cleansing foam, revitalizing hydrating serum, and the eye concentrate, which I've really wanted to try!\nI've never tried anything from this brand but I've always read great things about it! Their treatment mask is supposed to be good for long flights and celebs and supermodels swear by it! I've also heard a lot about their treatment essence. It balances out your skin to improve texture and moisture.\nThis set comes with the super loved rose mask and 3 travel sized products, including their micellar water. The mask says it smoothes, plumps, and brightens the skin. I really love any product that makes my skin feel and look plump because it gives my skin a youthful glow.\nTHIS gift set is on my wishlist. It includes so many amazing products for the price that I'm honestly surprised it's not sold out yet. It includes a Kevyn Aucoin volume mascara, a mini Oribe dry texturizing spray, a gold glitter Smith & Cult nail polish (perfect for holidays!), Sunday Riley good genes treatment, an Eve Lom cleanser, a Lipstick Queen frog prince lipstick, and a By Terry baume de rose crystalline lip balm. A $233 value all for under $100!\nThe two products I want to try from this set are the full sized lip cheat in the shade pillow talk and the magic cream.\nThese MAC mini lipsticks come in 3 different colors to choose from - cool, warm or pink.\nAnother lipstick mini complete with a nude, pink and red shade!\nDon't these nail polish colors just scream holidays! It comes with a nude, glitter, and wine color - the only colors you really need this fall & winter.\nI had to include this in here because it's one of my favorite fragrances. It's a feminine and fresh scent that doesn't feel overpowering like other Chanel perfumes. The best part is it lasts all day long with just one spritz. This gift set comes with the 3.4 oz bottle and an additional travel size perfume to throw in your bag.\nIf you've never tried Charlotte Tilury this would be a great introductory set. It comes with everything you need to complete a whole makeup look. I love all the colors in this specific set but if you don't they have a lot more options to choose from.\nThis gift set is also on my wishlist. Diptyque candles are just gorgeous and look great on display. Their empty glasses also work great to hold makeup brushes or bobby pins depending on the size. This is a 12 mini candle set so they are the 1.2 oz size. It is definitely worth it if you want to find your favorite scent from Diptyque compared to this set of 5 minis for $75.\nI love YSL lipsticks. They're the best and the packaging is just gorgeous! This set comes with their best selling red lipstick, a full size mascara and a sample size of the super popular touche elcat blur primer.\nThis little set is the perfect way to find your favorite Jo Malone fragrance! It comes with lime basil & mandarin, english pear & freesia, nectarine blossom & honey, english oak & redcurrant, and wood sage & sea salt.  The only scents I've tried are oak & red currant and wood sage & sea salt and they are both so lovely and fresh.\nThese are lovely gift guides dear! I think I'd get myself the MAC mini lipstick set. ha!<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "1. Fancy candles are always a good idea. This set from Byredo is a new discovery and I love all the scents! And the packaging is minimal and so chic.\n2. Diptyque anything! Diptyque holiday packaging is like no other and the candle set is perfect for a luxury lover. It comes in two different sizes so you can determine just how much you want to splurge. Ha!\n3. The ultimate advent calendar. Continuing the Diptyque love, their advent calendar is one of the biggest sellers for them but it is a major spend. However, it manages to sell out so quickly every year so clearly it\u2019s worth the splurge. If perfume is more your preference, this Atelier Cologne Advent Calendar is gorgeous with a great selection of scents. And if you want one that encompasses everything beauty, this set from Net-a-Porter is the one to buy.\n4. Pampering bath products. This bath line is well priced but feels more expensive than it is, and the scents are delicious. This is my favorite rose scent and the body wash is a nice way to enjoy this luxurious line at a more manageable price point. Fancy hand soap is something we rarely buy for ourselves but it would make a great gift!  The most elegant stocking stuff ever!\n5. Fancy makeup with even better packaging. This line of lipsticks has some of the best packaging as well as one of the best formulas. I\u2019ve been raving about this eye shadow palette over the past few weeks and it\u2019s one that I would highly recommend giving to a fellow makeup lover (also available here)!\n6. The ultimate lipstick set. If someone in your life just got a huge bonus or major promotion this year and they want to spoil you, this lipstick set is the one to ask for! This other one is a tenth of the price but would still be amazing to receive.\n7. For the person that has all the makeup and skincare. They need something fabulous to carry it all in like this marble print travel case. Or maybe upgrade their at home makeup routine with this luxe mirror.\n8. Skincare sets worth splurging on. I use almost every single product from this line and love them all (including the cleansing balm which is a staple for me). This microneedling set is actually what I would love to receive and have been wanting to try it for the past year! Jade rolling and facial massage is all the rage right now but this facial roller is the ultimate splurge (and here it is in a set). I have it and use it every day. It can also be used on the body because of it\u2019s larger size which helps to justify the price a bit more (a small bit but still). Sunday Riley sets are always popular and this one has a great selection of her products.\n9. Limited edition skincare packaging \u2013 As a packaging fanatic, I love the holidays because all the fancy limited edition versions come out. This larger version of Vintner\u2019s Daughter has the most gorgeous bottle design, while the holiday SK-II Facial Treatment Essence bottle has become a collectors\u2019 item at this point.\n10. Splurgeworthy hair products. I use this curling iron every single day and it\u2019s worth every penny. It heats up quickly and my curls last all day. And if this texturizing spray (which is one of the best) is a must have for you, this limited edition size and bottle should be on your wish list.\n11. A few other random beauty products not to miss \u2013 this silk set which is the ultimate luxury. I love sleeping on a silk pillowcase and this is the gold standard. For the decor obsessed, this candle is absolutely gorgeous! I plan on ordering this for myself.\nStay tuned for my next gift guide coming next weekend!!<|endoftext|>"

In 1963 Diptyque started producing a series of scented candles which soon gained world-wide fame. In 1968 Diptyque produced its first toilet water, l'EAU, based on a XVIth century pot pourri and clove pomander recipe.

        "passage": " For fall I absolutely love Tree House. I visited the Byredo store in Soho for the first time last year and this was burning in their store. Notes include bamboo, pimento, hay, labdanum and leather. It\u2019s so hard for me to describe but it has a good leather + sandalwood mix.\nNew this season is Chai which is the perfect Masala Chai scent. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever burned anything chai scented in my home and this one smells just like the perfect spicy chai tea latte. It does have a very seasonal feel to it, so if you want something more neutral I\u2019d opt for Woods or Tree House.\nFor this season they\u2019ve brought back the minis! You can buy a few of them individually or in a 3-box set with La Selection Violette Mini Candle Trio with Fleur Fantome, Bibliotheque and Burning Rose or La Selection Bois with Bohemia, Cotton Poplin and Tree House. With the minis I was gifted a set and am so excited to burn through them. I\u2019ve bought and used up Bibliotheque and Fleur Fantome before. This was my first time trying Burning Rose.\nLumira is another brand that I\u2019ve had a long love affair with. The Tahitian Coconut is the best coconut and the Persian Rose is the best rose in my humble opinion. The line is based in Australia but their website does offer international shipping. This year they recently launched at Barneys New York in the US and Selfridges in the UK so if you have a store near you I\u2019d recommend checking them out. It\u2019s rare that I like all the scents in a brand but with Lumira, Almira the founder has created exquisite variations in every single candle.\nFor the holiday season she launched Nuit de Noel which smells like Christmas. Notes include black pepper, clove, cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg, aniseed, pear, cumin, rose, lavender, coriander, clary sage, oriental, amber, labdanum, sandalwood, tonka bean, cedarwood, patchouli. I really adore her accessories. She has the prettiest Glass Dome (shown below) along with the best Wick Trimmer I\u2019ve tried (it has an angle which makes it easier to get into smaller jars without tilting the trimmer part) and a Candle Snuffer which I\u2019ve never invested in before but am really happy to own one.\nMany of you love classics from Jo Malone and Le Labo. I\u2019ve burned through a few scents in each line but still keep going back to Diptyque and Byredo. From Jo Malone right now I\u2019m burning Wood Sage and Sea Salt which is a nice option for fall if you don\u2019t want your house to smell like cinnamon, pine or spice. From Le Labo the Santal Candle is my favorite for a strong sandalwood kind of scent, notes include amber, coco, vanilla, cedar, spices, musk and sandalwood. I bought the Violet Grey x Le Labo Santal candle and stocked up when it was in stock. It\u2019s the same as the clear glass version just with black glass.\nSenreve Mini Maestra (c/o) shown above. I still really love it! Full review here. I\u2019m also ecstatic I found peonies at Whole Foods!\nCire Trudon is my most expensive splurge for candles. One of my readers messaged me on a weekly basis for months urging me to buy Ernesto. I finally did and there is no going back. It\u2019s one of the best ones out there. I know scent is so personal but so many of you have told me you also love this. It has a masculine vibe with notes of leather and tobacco. Because it\u2019s so expensive I\u2019ve only burned through a small handful of these (and a few minis). Sometimes they\u2019ll do this one in special packaging so I bought the Rose Gold Ernesto which is a little more pricey but really beautiful. Notes include rum, grapefruit, bergamot, clove, oak wood, patchouli, labdanum, tobacco, moss, leather and amber.\nThe entire line is available at a local store near me and I smell them all every time I visit. Nazareth is the most Christmas-like smelling candle I\u2019ve ever smelled. I really want to buy their Six Candle as well but the steep price tag is pretty hard to justify.\nOther brands that I love that are more affordable and have great gift options include Nest Fragrances and Henri Bendel. The Nest Fragrances Holiday candle is a classic that comes in a wide range of size options. I\u2019ve tried several of the mini ones and the throw is pretty impressive! For the sizes the prices are very reasonable. Henri Bendel makes some really amazing options for the price and the scents are nice \u2013 not overly sweet or saturated. Their Vanilla Bean is one of the best not-too-sweet vanillas I\u2019ve ever burned.\nFor those who cannot burn candles, diffusers and room sprays are nice alternatives. I haven\u2019t tried many diffusers although I have loved the ones from Antica Farmacista. In terms of room sprays Molton Brown makes amazing ones. Andrew is obsessed with the Coco and Sandalwood one. Diptyque also makes some amazing ones, unfortunately if you\u2019re in the US you don\u2019t have easy access to all the scents, but I\u2019m happy they have at least a few. I\u2019ve been drooling over the Byredo ones for months now but haven\u2019t taken the plunge to splurge. Putting it on my Christmas Wish List though!\nFor me, a key accessory for candle care is a wick trimmer. You can definitely use your regular scissors but having one just for candles is nice because the tip is beveled so you can cut the wick straight. It also prevents your scissors from getting burnt remnants on them and the tip catches the cut off end.\nThe Diptyque Wick Trimmer has been one of the best things I\u2019ve ever bought but I think Lumira makes a better one. It\u2019s sleeker and the angle of the wick trimmer makes it easier to trim wicks straight. Also the angle of the handle makes it easier to hold for me. I never felt the need to invest in a candle snuffer but Lumira sent over their Candle Snuffer and I think it\u2019s really nice.\nI hope you enjoyed this holiday candle roundup! With all the options out there I think mini sets are the best way to sample candles, especially if you can\u2019t smell them all in person. It can be overwhelming with all the options out there. I think it\u2019s nice to treat yourself to a small handful at a time. They set the mood for the home in such a nice way.\nI\u2019ve linked the accessories shown in the post in case you want to know the details of the trays, books and lights for your own home decor. What are your favorite holiday candles?\nPress samples include Byredo Mini Trio and all Lumira products shown. Senreve Bag also gifted. All other items purchased by me.\nI\u2019m thrilled to share that the Diptyque City Candles will be available online at Diptyqueparis.com and in Diptyque boutiques for a limited time starting today 9/27 through Sunday 9/30. There are currently 9 city candles that have been created for Beverly Hills, London, Miami, Tokyo, New York City, Shanghai, Berlin, Paris and Hong Kong. Each candle comes in a beautifully designed jar. Since they are only available to the stores in each corresponding city they\u2019re harder to find and track down, but Diptyque is launching them all online for a limited time. Two new launches this round for online include Hong Kong and Paris. There is also a new Boxed Set of Six City Candles that comes packaged together in a white box.\nWhile these are typically only available in city boutiques (similar to the Le Labo city perfumes), there have been a few times where Diptyque has launched the collection online so I was able to buy the ones I didn\u2019t own from boutique trips, but they sell out very fast! Earlier this year I found a wonderful Paris shopper who travels from the US to Paris frequently for work to purchase a couple of the Paris ones for me. Every single one is amazing and beautiful. The boxes these come in are just as beautiful if not prettier than the actual candle jars themselves.\nI have a review for each one today except Berlin. I have the older version which is packaged in a clear glass jar and based on the description I think the tinted design jar is same as the clear one but I haven\u2019t smelled it to confirm.\nQuick note for the US city candles and if you\u2019re based in the US. While the candles are only available at each city boutique (Beverly Hills, Miami, NYC) \u2013 you can call the store to order and they will ship to you! Every store I\u2019ve ordered from and called is very friendly, patient and helpful.\nBeverly Hills was the first city candle I discovered. I reviewed it several years ago when we were still living in San Diego. I am a little embarrassed to admit how many I stocked up on but this was my go-to for a long time.

        "passage": " wearing my fragrances is more important to me than being right in this argument.\nKnowing that (some of) my audience likes to tweak and make their own \"improvements\" to what I laboured on long and hard and believe to be the best I can offer - I know that this battle is hopeless from the start. So instead of convincing you why you shouldn't do it - here are the five things you need to know about fragrance layering to make it actually work for you and create that \"wow\" effect you are after, even though I know just as well that you're going to be more satisfied when you make your own errors and find ways to fix them, all on your own. I also know that rules are probably not exactly what someone who's mixing and matching unrelated fragrances is after - so consider these suggestions, tips, ideas...\nChoose scents that are simple. i.e.: Soliflores (from The Language of Flowers collection) and single-minded fragrances that are focused around one or two ingredients (such as Vetiver Racinettes or Film Noir) are more likely to create an impact.\nIf you choose fragrances that are too complex, you are more likely to end up with a rather nondescript scent, or a cacophony of odours. I was tipped by someone on one of the forums (my apologies for not remembering who) to layer Apres l'Ondee with Philosykos. They were right, the violets and fig notes in these two do mix very well together. But I can't imagine two classic Guerlains working well together because these are all a helluva complex, sophisticated fragrances. Adding a little bit of something simple like a single note fig fragrance though creates a surprising results.\nChoose one \"light\" and one \"heavy\" fragrances or scents of equal or similar \"weight\". This is not literally the same as top, heart and base note - but a very similar concept. i.e.: an Oriental or Chypre fragrance is heavier than a citrus. Florals tend to have more of a medium weight (although there are always exceptions to these rules).\nLikewise, pairing fragrances that are both very \"loud\" could clash - both of them competing rather than complementing each other. It's better to have one loud and one more mellow - so they can both complement each other. I wouldn't mix together two very strong minded fragrances such as Angel, Yohji or Lolita Lempicka, for instance. But taking one of those and then adding something light and refreshing such as an eau de cologne or a mellow woodsy fragrance centred around sandalwood or vetiver, for example - might just work.\nYour layered fragrance is greatly influenced by the order in which you apply the scents to your skin. The one that goes on first would be less noticeable in the beginning of the wear; but would grow over time to reveal itself as the \"base notes\" of the fragrance. That is why I recommend you use the heavier scent first and the lighter scent second. Otherwise, the more fleeting fragrance gets lost in the more dominant or \"heavy\" one. For example: I would apply Jo Malones Black Vetyver Cafe before Vintage Gardenia in that order - applying the other way around simply buries the gardenia in a grave of earthy vetiver.\nIt is well known that how you apply the scent (spray, dab, roll-on, or creme/solid perfume) makes an impact on how the scent is perceived - closer to the skin or with greater aura (often called sillage). This of course has a lot to do with the concentration as well.\nFrom my experience, spraying one layer of fragrance on top of another produces poor quality of layering and mingling of the scents. What you'll get instead is the two scents kind of sitting on top of each other without much interaction. The smell will kind of jump from one impression to the other, like a CD track stuck between two notes. After a while, you'll end up with just the first scent noticeable, which kind of defeats the whole purpose. There are several methods I suggest for mixing the fragrances together, depending on the method of application - please note that even though we are aiming for simultaneous application with most of these methods - you still should be applying the stronger or heavier scent first in all these methods.\nHere you want to employ a simultaneous application, as much as humanly possible. Get both bottles ready with their caps removed. Using your strong hand apply the 1st scent to the opposite wrists, following immediately by the 2nd fragrance. Gently rub the two wrists together so that the scents literally blend on top of your skin while they are still wet (before they get fully absorbed).\nGet the caps removed from both bottles. Draw a two parallel lines with the fragrances, and mix together by gently rubbing your wrists. From there you can transfer to your neck, etc. In order to prevent scent contamination between your roll-on bottles, make sure you're not using the roll-on on skin that has scent on it already.\nWith solid perfumes the evaporation is not as critical as with alcohol based fragrances. That gives you a little bit more time between applications (but not enough time to answer emails or go and shower in between!). You could just smear them one on top of each other - and if you are using an applicator that is even give you the freedom to scoop a little bit of each and mix them on your skin the same way you'd blend makeup. This also allows you to apply the scents on many other parts of your skin that don't necessarily rub against each other like your wrists do. I would also recommend applying the two scents on two different wrists and then rubbing them together.\nWhat's tricky about this method is the high chance of contamination. So dabbing carefully on two separate wrists, or on two close to each other but scent-free areas on your wrists, and making sure the dabber goes back into the right bottles are key. Once you applied a bit of each scent, blend by rubbing your wrists together.\nWhen using mixed methods of applications, use the one that uses skin contact method first (i.e.: roll on, dabbing, creme parfum) and the spray second. Remember to choose your scents carefully - it is still advisable that the first scent is the stronger, heavier, more dominant, and using the ligher, mellower scent on top as to give it a chance to shine at all.\nCall me a snob, but just like how I don't like creating perfumes by mixing poor quality fragrance oils with top notch floral absolutes from fear of ruining them - I am a bit weary of mixing together fragrances of extreme gap in quality.\nSarah Jessica Parker may have been lucky when she mixed up her high-fashion fragrance Avignon with drugstore and street vendors' musks. It worked for her but it won't usually work well to mix poor quality fragrances with high quality ones - it is more likely going to ruin the good quality scent and bring it down rather than elevate the inferior fragrance. Although when that happens it must feel like pure magic. Without a proper training for your nose, you may have difficulty pinpointing the quality of different fragrances and raw materials separately from the brand image, price, etc. So this is a bit difficult to give you real guidelines for. While I am not promoting using only scents that were made by the same brand - there is something to be said about layering scents that were meant to be worn that way, as in the case of the Jo Malone brand - and even then, I found only a handful of the combinations to be worth while. And of course, these were discontinued (Black Vetiver Cafe layered with Vintage Gardenia with Cardamom and Myrrh). What I would suggest is that you start with layering all natural fragrances, which are more likely to bring out harmonies. Even that would be tricky... The more I think (and write) about it, the more I realize that this rule I've just made up is just screaming to be broken... So I would be more than a tad curious to hear from you what outrageous layering you've been up to. They can be of any brand whatsoever - but whomever wins this luck of the draw contest will receive three mini perfumes that I absolutely love layering: Film Noir, Lovender and Rosebud. I will talk more about combos from my own line in later posts, a series that is dedicated to layering.\nTo summarize, while as a perfumer, I strongly feel that perfumers should formulate their fragrances in such way that they provide a stimulating fragrance all around, a complete work of olfactory art that does not require any boost from the outside. That is how I design my perfumes, always, and that is how I think it should be done. The idea of creating something incomplete in advance, in order to sell more bottles seems like cheating to me (and I've discussed it before in my article \"Layering Fragrance - with Style\"). Though it does pose its own compositional challenges and those, I admit, can be fun. Also I do like the fact that it promotes the customer's own creativity and gives them room for playing and expressing themselves through fragrance.\nAt September 27, 2017 4:14 AM, Mercurygirl said...\nI have to admit that I seldom feel the urge to layer fragrances. The only time it crosses my mind is when one seems to be lacking something, and fortunately, that's not the case with most of the scents in my wardrobe. I have occasionally layered lighter scents over Diptyque's Tam D<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "What is Niche Perfumery?\nBefore I can answer this question, let\u2019s converse about the public view of perfumery. We have the trailblazers, the renown luxury brands, such as Chanel, Hermes, Dior, and Guerlain who established perfumery as a necessity. The other brands started picking up on this trend and began to join in this movement, which is why even grocery stores and furniture stores these days are selling perfume.\nSo in this perspective, what is niche perfumery? Perhaps, we can go back 50 years to when brands such as L\u2019Artisan Parfumeur and Diptyque started launching perfumes. One was a chemist interested in creating unique scents, and the other was a group of three friends who wanted perfume to serve as an artistic outlet. Fast forward to 2021, we see that many of the niche perfumes have moved into the limelight, such as Jo Malone, Le Labo, Tom Ford, and Byredo to name a few. These niche perfumes have essentially become \ud835\ude62\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68-\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a fragrances simply because they\u2019ve made it, through the power of marketing and perfumery.\nSo what is niche perfumery nowadays? In my opinion, niche perfumery is analogous to indie music. A great niche perfumery brand is like a great indie music artist that is waiting to be uncovered, and revealed to the general public.\n\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc31\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc20\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25 \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1f \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2a\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc1e.\nWe are here to provide a platform for niche perfumery brands to come sing their song. Although not every song will be accepted by everyone, we sincerely hope that you can walk away with a new olfactive perspective.<|endoftext|>"

Aimee Yoshioka is the largest flowered of all Gardenias with large, glossy, dark green foliage on a vigorous and moderately fast growing evergreen shrub. The large dark foliage provides a wonderful foil for the large white flowers. Easily trained into a tree standard. Aimee is also considered to be one of the largest growing Gardenias, particularly in mild winter climates where it is known to reach 10-12' high but 5-6' may be more typical.\nHere is the bloom.\nI have not decided yet if these will go in the front garden, but I do plan to use them in a pair of blue and white Chinese fishbowls.

I hope so!\nVictoria: Anne Marie, I think that oils are so good in dry climates, because they seem to moisturize or perhaps retain moisture better. Nuxe also has a great oil with gold glitter, and although I\u2019m not sure where to wear it (coming to work with glittering legs doesn\u2019t seem right!), it is irresistible.\nAustenfan: Eau Dynamisante used to have a dry oil spray. Great smell, and wonderful for your skin.\nVictoria: I haven\u2019t seen the dry oil form of it. Wonder if it has been discontinued.\nAustenfan: I think it has been. Which is a shame, I like it better than their bodylotion or the fragrance itself.\nRummaging through my brain ( I am at work so can\u2019t rummage through my cupboards) I realised I actually own a bottle of Heure Exquise body oil.\nI don\u2019t think I need to explain how wonderful it is.\nVictoria: You need not explain! It is such a great perfume, and I can just imagine how good it would be in the oil form.\nAustenfan: It\u2019s good to hear things are improving for you. Tea is always a good thing, it never fails to hit the spot.\nRowanhill: Nuxe dry oil with and w/o goldflakes is an absolute essential, although I use the sparkly one mainly on summer evenings on legs, arms and shoulders, or during the holiday season when a bit of glitter seems fitting.\nFor this summer I also got the Caudalie oil and albeit it is nice to have something different for a change I keep returning to Nuxe for its fragrance.\nElemis\u2019 Exotic Frangipani Monoi Moisture Melt, Ligne St Barth Avocado oil and Hei Poa Tiar\u00e9 oil especially in the winter, Est\u00e9e Lauder Azur\u00e9e Soleir dry oil is another summer staple or a memory of sun in the winter, Bio-Oil, as well as Clarins\u2019 Huile Tonic and Huile Anti-Eau.\nBela: My favourite is still the Eau Prodigieuse and I\u2019ve just discovered that there is a whole range of Nuxe skincare that has the same scent. I didn\u2019t like the perfume they\u2019ve brought out, but the face cream is lovely (I was given a sample of it the other day and am seriously considering buying a whole jar).\nBela: Jeanne Piaubert is one of those niche brands, you know, like Guinot, etc. I\u2019d forgotten about it until I read your blog post. It really is lovely.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "It\u2019s a crisp new season and as we start donning heavier knits, the benefits we require from our beauty products begin to shift. Autumnal offerings are all about creamy textures (it\u2019s masking season, after all), seasonal essences, and spiced flavors. When it comes ingredients, fall brings to mind those that come straight from nature; like olive oil, oats and cranberry. Fresh, citrusy notes also find their way into body creams and perfumes, helping to round out warmer notes, creating depth and capturing the freshness of a fall breeze.\nWhen it comes to skincare, everything in our autumnal regimen \u2014 from creams to serums \u2013becomes a bit more substantive, helping to protect sensitive skin and hair from the elements. In addition to thicker skin care textures, lightweight oils are also seasonal favorites, not just because they can be used for aromatherapy benefits, but also because adding a few drops of oil to your lotion can help you stay fragrantly prepped for drier air outside. A little organic coconut or turmeric essential oil can go a long way in terms of caring for cuticles, scalp and dry patches.\nSo grab your pumpkin spice latte (no judgement here), and embrace the flavorings of this cooler season. Here, five of our favorite fall beauty ingredients.\nThis nutritive elixir can be used on a lot more than your salad. Known as the first homemade beauty ingredient, olive oil (which Homer referred to as \u2018liquid gold\u2019) was historically used as a cure-all, and according to Hippocrates, could remedy 60 ailments. Try out the extract\u2019s restorative powers for yourself with Clove + Hallow Lip Glaze. Starring olive oil, jojoba oil and shea butter, this creamy lip color is both pretty and good for your skin. For those looking to infuse olive oil into their hair care regimen (thanks to its strand-taming properties), check out Ouidad\u2019s Advanced Climate Control Featherlight Styling Cream, which keeps frizz at bay with an autumnal blend of meadowfoam seed, olive, and soybean. Also featuring a protein derived from silk, the formula helps seals the cuticle to lock in moisture and protect against damage from environmental aggressors. We love Ouidad and you should too!\nAlthough citrus may remind you of summer days; the clean, zesty profile of these uplifting fruits is also a prolific one in cooler seasons. Typically blended with musky bottom notes, citrus perfectly complements warm fall profiles, leaving the wearer feeling both soft and bold. Proving that warmer scents don\u2019t have to be heavy, Rituals Shower Foam in Happy Buddha combines the freshness of orange with the warmth of cedar wood. The lightweight gel, which transforms into a creamy moisturizing foam, is blended with natural essential oils for a fragrant, and happiness-imparting, showering experience. And speaking of a fall-appropriate citrus, further proving this season is a perfect time for some citrus, Diptyque\u2019s new Fall 2017 Vetyverio Eau de Toilette, is an unforgettable amalgam of warm woods, fresh vetiver and grapefruit. The scent was dubbed \u201cutterly addictive\u201d by Vogue UK\u2019s beauty editor.\nWe found our favorite fall skincare formula and it\u2019s chock full of good-for-you ingredients that incidentally sound perfect for a nice fall breakfast; like non-fat milk powder, and finely-milled whole grain oats. LU\u00c9 by Jean Seo ERASE also includes a touch of magnesium carbonate, for a perfectly pH balanced face scrub that clears a clogged complexion, balances skin, and leaves it feeling smooth and fresh. For its part, Pureology Hydrate Sheer Shampoo and Conditioner, which contains wheat protein in addition to soybean oil, is designed to leave hair squeaky clean, yet soft and manageable. Another grain-filled beauty offering is Lanc\u00f4me Paris Visionnaire Advanced Multi-Correcting Cream, which was formulated with rye seed extract alongside hyaluronic acid for skin-plumping results.\nA delicious side dish indeed, cranberry and other berries make for equally delicious beauty ingredients. Take, for one, the Grown Alchemist Deep Cleansing Masque: Wheatgerm, Ginkgo & Cranberry, which features cranberry seed extract to defend skin from free radical damage, white clay and wheat germ to visibly reduce pore size. Another berry-infused offering is one of the scent variety, as Jafra Paris et Moi de Toilette combines Mara strawberries, rose petal macaron and silky woods for an artful riff of femininity. Meant to inspire the wearer straight to the Champs de\u2019Lyse, we love how this feels at once bold and subdued.\nPumpkin may not seem it, but the humble orange gourd is a low-key skincare hero. Going beyond the front stoop and into your skin care, you can find essences from the seasonal fruit in products like Murad Transforming Powder, which contains pumpkin seed extract and complexion-clearing bio-enzymes. If you are looking for a relaxing face masking experience,the Peter Thomas Roth Pumpkin Enzyme Mask is as much a stress-reducing treatment, as much as a professional-strength peel. Formulated with actual pumpkin puree and enzymes, this fragrant treatment promises to bring to mind images of pumpkin carving. Also at work in the formula are natural pumpkin extracts, which help dissolve bacteria, and leave skin feeling fresh and clean. Happy fall, loves!\nHoliday feelings for your phone!<|endoftext|>"

It holds 10-12% essential oils, which is much more than the typical 5-8% fragrance load of soy wax. So, the scent is stronger and brings about a positive mood boost.

Allow your candle at least 30 minutes to start releasing its scent fully (as the wax melts, the fragrance oils are released,) so if you are planning a romantic evening, light the candle a little bit in advance.\nExtra: L\u2019Artisan Parfumeur Rose des Indes (6.2oz, $60), Diptyque Roses (6.5oz, $60) Amouage First Rose ($105, 6.2oz) and Fred\u00e9ric Malle Rose Rugosa ($80, 7.8oz.). Rose des Indes is a rather sweet rose with a strong peach-vanilla accent: nice, but too cloying for me. Roses is a classical, pretty tea rose, similar to L\u2019Occitane\u2019s Rose 4 Reines, but the throw leaves a lot to be desired, especially when compared to the other candles I smelled. First Rose is an incense and geranium accented red rose, while Rosa Rugosa captures the smell of wild roses remarkably well. I very much liked First Rose, which is the closest to the idea of an incense embellished rose, but $105 is a price barrier I personally cannot cross for a candle.\nAvailability: most of these candles are available at Barneys NY and Aedes; Annick Goutal is also sold at Bergdorf Goodman and Saks5thAvenue; Tocca at Sephora; L'Occitane at L'Occitane stores.\nDo you have your own favorite rose candles, or other candles you like to burn to create a romantic ambiance?\nI am so curious about the Malle candle, but as you say, the price is prohibitive indeed. But there are many great alternatives out there, thank you for narrowing it down for us. The Ladur\u00e9e sounds particularly enticing.\nI'm partial to the Roja Dove Rose candle - dont know how widely available it is as mine was from his perfume hall at Harrods. It is a crackling, smouldering rose with a bright fruit heart and good throw. For nights one feels powerful and perhaps like taking charge?\nThe price for Malle is high, but considering that it is a fairly large candle, it is not that bad. Amouage, on the other hand, is at the kind of price bracket that I do not even want to consider for a candle.\nSince you are quite a candle connoisseur, I am curious what candles you like to burn for romantic, relaxing ambiance?\nSounds great! I have not smelled any of Roja Dove candles, but I heard that they are very good quality. Something new to add to my list, thank you.\n*warning- public display of affection coming up* You are the best! Although my credit card would disagree. I certainly need the Red Flower one and the Mariage Fr\u00e8res one...for starters. You know I completely forgot about the LAP rose candle, probably exactly because we've never burned it due to its headachy sweetness.\nI have two small children, so I do not quite understand what you mean by relaxing and romantic???\nWhat a wonderful round-up, V., thank you so much! I think I value good candle reviews even more than perfume reviews since it is (so far) impossible to \"sample\" a candle. I do wish more companies would consider votive or other small sizes, but I suppose there are financial reasons for doing otherwise.\nI want to hear more about the Mariage Freres line from you--have heard such interesting things from other people--but am equally glad to hear the L'Occitane is an option. I am often pleased by the quality of their stuff.\nI like your earlier suggestion of Annick Goutal Noel, which I will try soon. Amber is another favorite candle scent of mine, and Annick Goutal has an excellent one.\n*blushing* :) You are most welcome! I am glad that I could contribute to your quest a bit. Mariage Fr\u00e8res Rose is excellent, a very intimate, relaxing fragrance. If L'Artisan Rose des Indes makes me feel as if I am in some stuffy, pink decorated boudoir, Rose d'Himalaya takes me outdoors. A very elegant, evocative scent. The Rouge is another favorite.\nI feel that it would be easier just to make a coffee candle for you than to look for it. I have not found a single candle that approximates the scent of freshly brewed coffee, or at least, the scent of crushed beans.\nA, I am glad that you liked it! I had a bit of fun with this, because not only have I always enjoyed making candles (although mine are not as nearly as good as the ones available commercially, still learning,) I love the process of using them. Something about lighting the candle and coming back to find the room nicely scented is so pleasant.\nI agree, candle reviews are very valuable for me too. Small votives are still too expensive for the quantity in the high-end lines. I tend to come across a lot of candles, but some definitely stand out for me. L'Artisan makes some of the best candles and so does Tocca. Mariage Fr\u00e8res is fantastic, and I will write more on this line.\nExcuse my interrupting, but Marina, I was at a favorite coffee house the other day and saw that they had positioned little glass lamps filled with fluid (kerosene?) in bowls of fresh roasted beans. As they burned, they heated up the beans and voila... Might be something to try, even with a plain votive.\nA, it is free for all, no excuses needed! :) What a terrific idea! I myself want to try it the moment I get home.\ncrafty! :) so beans wiuld be around votives in a bowl?\nI agree completely about the dried petals on top of the Red Flower candles! An unnecessary gimmick. Having said that, RF is in my opinion a great line and also very affordable. I was a big fan of two discontinued scents - the Lilac and Himalayan Larch. Still, the Indian Jasmine is still out there and the Moroccan Rose - both wonderful. My favorite candle for the last TWO YEARS is Signature Extraordinaire by Martyn Lawrence-Bullard, a Los Angeles designer. His description says it all: \"A unique fragrance combining the essence of rare Balinese mahogany, Asian teak and warm Amber with exotic undertones revealing spicy Ceylonese clove, Indian Cardamom and quince. A deep smoky fragrance of extraordinary beauty.\" And perfect for the contemplative dreamy moods winter weather inspires. Sadly, this candle is currently being wasted here on my desk in balmy L.A. I wish I could \"beam\" it to you.\nIt would indeed be appropriate today. We had a record amount of snow last night (and also rain, sleet and lightning simultaneously!) If I did not have deadlines looming large, I would have stayed at home and enjoyed some tea while watching The Classical Movie Channel.\nAt any rate, our tastes in candles are similar. Indian Jasmine is one of my favorite candles and I also still mourn Lilac. Diptyque's lilac just does not compare.\nHowever, I do have a habit of bringing or purchasing a scented candle when I travel. I utilize all the proper cautions, of course...but it is just so nice to have the change in atmosphere both the gentle flame and the waft offer to a room, no matter how spartan the conditions.\nAlso, an \"oh!\" at the MF candle, for Rose Himalaya is one of the teas I ended up choosing to bring home with me last summer. And while I'll probably still opt for the waft from my tea cup, it is a genuine distraction, given my already established emotional connection with the scent.\nRose d'Himalaya tea is great, as is Marco Polo (wild strawberry scented.) Even though I do not drink scented tea that often, time to time I indulge.\nMy naive nose can't necessarily discern the fruit in Signature Extraordinaire - one whiff kickstarts a delirious swoon into exotica. His Byzantine candle is the the more fruity one - red currant and cucumber notes. I prefer the patchouli-based Ottomania and the gorgeous Vetiver Moresque to the fruit. Check out his website under products. His candles are my favorite gift to give b/c he utilizes his colorful tribal-inspired fabric designs in the packaging. The boxes are so fun and gorgeous that I am constiutionally incapable of throwing them away.\nI keep candles in the bathroom because...well....El O....well...anyway (blushes)... and there's a green-y Diptyque (Dyptique? you know what I mean) that I keep in the den/dog bedroom - that's a Very Ripe Room, indeed!  Ew. Candle helps. A lot.\nNone in my own spaces, though - most candles inflame my sinuses so I have to sniff carefully. Malle's 1er Mai is probably my choice, were I to be locked in a small room with a burning candle. It is absolutely gorgeous.\nIm printing out this list as I type. Thank you for a comprehensive and fun overview. I love rose scents and so far my favorite rose candle is L'Artisan's. It's very very strong, so I never burn it for more than<|endoftext|>"

It\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea but it always feels like Christmas to me! It smells warm and cozy.\n3. Diptyque Vanille is a smokey vanilla. It\u2019s not your typical sweet gourmand vanilla. It\u2019s almost like a leather smokey kind of vanilla that has a warm vibe.\n4. Diptyque Ambre is my favorite amber scent. It has the perfect mix of wood, vetiver and patchouli with a hint of spice. It\u2019s another warm one \u2013 I bought the large colored glass version a few years ago and found it a lot more potent than the standard size (which is still very good).\n5. Diptyque Santal is the best sandalwood candle. It\u2019s not too strong or spicy and is perfect year round.\nI bought the Mini Carousel Set and standard size Lucky Charm carousels last year and love them! They usually have them out only during the holiday season. Both are still available right now at Nordstrom.\n6. Cire Trudon Ernesto is the best candle of all time to me. It\u2019s a magical mix of leather and tobacco \u2013 but I find it hard to describe. I have yet to try all the Cire Trudon candles (I have also tried minis of Positano and Rose Poivree which were lovely!). They\u2019re the most expensive candle splurge I\u2019ve made for the home in past years. Every Christmas they launch special edition packaging for a selection of scents. The Cire Trudon team was generous enough to send this year\u2019s for review and it\u2019s GLORIOUS! I have the Classic size but it also comes in two larger options.\n7 / 8 / 9 Cire Trudon Gabriel, Nazareth and Fir have been on my radar for years but every time I\u2019ve decided to buy one I always go back to Ernesto. They have a beautiful Odeurs D\u2019Hiver Christmas Trio which is boxed in the most beautiful packaging I have ever seen. Every candle in the box is carefully packed with inserts around the edges and also in the top to protect the wick/wax. Gabriel is glorious mix of leather, chestnut and wood. Nazareth is a mix of clove, oranges and cinnamon (smells like Christmas!). I\u2019ve always been more of a pine lover for Christmas scents but Cire Trudon Fir is so unique and sweet while still being very green.\n10. Byredo Tree House is my favorite one from the line. When I first smelled it years ago I actually did not like the way it smelled straight out of the jar. It wasn\u2019t until I smelled it burning in their New York store that I decided to give it a try. It has the most amazing mix of cedar, bamboo, sandalwood, guaiac wood, hay, spice, myrrh and labdanum. It\u2019s warm and cozy with wood and spice mix.\n11. Byredo Bibliotheque is almost like a smoky candle version of Bal D\u2019Afrique perfume to me. It\u2019s not as sweet but to me it has a similar vibe that is so unique and unlike anything else I\u2019ve tried. Even the little one has amazing throw.\n12. Aesop Room Sprays \u2013 For those who cannot burn candles room sprays are a great alternative. I\u2019m completely obsessed with all the Aesop Room Sprays and was thrilled to find they launched a mini trio this holiday! I\u2019ve also loved Diptyque Baies and 34 Boulevard St. Germain sprays as well for our home. I\u2019ve been dying to try one from Byredo but haven\u2019t yet.\nHow I recycle and clean out wax to recycle/repurpose candles in this post here. What are your favorite home scents for the holiday season?\nCire Trudon candles gifted. All others purchased by me.\nI receive cleaning questions quite frequently even though truth be told I\u2019m a messy person. The struggle to keep things organized is very real and it requires a lot of constant re-organizing to prevent things from just staying in piles on the desk or floor. I thought I\u2019d cover some frequently asked questions for beauty cleaning tips. I\u2019m asked almost daily about Diptyque candle jars, brush cleaning and clear bags I thought I\u2019d cover those in a roundup today.\nThere are many ways to clean out the excess wax from candle jars but with luxury candles like Diptyque, Byredo or Jo Malone you need to take a little extra care to keep the labels in tact. I\u2019ve found the clear glass jars from Diptyque have the most sturdy labels so if you get them wet it will still stay in tact. If you have a Byredo or Jo Malone candle or anything with a label that has a paper surface or doesn\u2019t have that coating make sure you don\u2019t get the exterior wet. What I do is quite simple! \nIf there are large chunks of wax in the bottom around the end of the wick you can scrape it out with a small rounded butter knife. I bought a set of four from Amazon and they work perfectly to get excess wax off the base and sides. Having a beveled tip makes it easier to hold and maneuver than a flat knife. If the wax is too hard you can soften it by adding hot tap water and let it sit for a few minutes.\nTo clean out the sides and excess wax pour a small amount of dish soap into the jar and add hot tap water to soften the rest. Let it soak for a few minutes for it to soften then wipe out with a paper towel or re-scrape the sides (depending on how much wax there is). If all the wax doesn\u2019t come off just repeat until it all comes clean. Sometimes stubborn remnants won\u2019t come off the first round.\nOthers have suggested freezing the wax out. You can definitely try it but freezing will only pop out the wax if you have a large chunk at the base. It won\u2019t clean out the excess stuck on the sides and if you have any burned remnants it won\u2019t come clean with freezing. Some like to add boiling water but I\u2019ve had the sticker labels melt off the sides from burning candles too long so I avoid using water that is extra hot.\nIf you have any clear makeup bags you know they are finger print prone and it\u2019s just a matter of time before you will see smudges from brushes or just dirty fingers in general.

L\u2019Oudh tends towards masculine, but if you\u2019re a woman who loves smoky, unisex leather fragrances like Bandit (Piguet) and Patchouli 24 (Le Labo), then I can\u2019t imagine you wouldn\u2019t also enjoy this. Currently available only as a mini when you purchase the latest Tauer magazine, it\u2019s available here.\nI\u2019ll be honest: I was going to stick The Body Shop\u2019s White Musk Oil in here, because it\u2019s very cheap (about \u20ac25 for 30mls), but then I realized I would be breaking one of my own rules for this article, which is only to pick perfumes that I\u2019d be happy wearing on a regular basis. And, while White Musk Oil is decent, it\u2019s really little more than a laundry musk dressed up with a bit of synthetic muguet. Kiehl\u2019s Original Musk Oil, on the other hand, is the business.\nThe oil skips the florals of the EdT and goes straight for the good stuff \u2013 the musk. Is it dirty or is it clean? It\u2019s a question that never gets answered. Kiehl\u2019s Musk is the equivalent of a nun in full habit who turns around to reveal there\u2019s no back and she\u2019s wearing no knickers. My husband threatens me with sex when I wear it, so there\u2019s that. Available at Kiehl\u2019s stores, or here.\nA recent obsession of mine (see full review here), Le Smoking is a clever re-working of the vintage leather chypre theme, mixing the butch, bitter leather of classic French perfumes such as Cabochard and Bandit with the sweetness of pot lifted directly out of the hippyish indie perfume scene. It\u2019s an unusual take on leather, and one that I think every man, woman, and child should have at least a tiny squidge of in their possession. Memorable and unisex, Le Smoking is available in many sizes, but most approachable is the 3ml voile de parfum spray, which can be shipped internationally. Although $18 for 3ml sounds like a lot, Le Smoking is, at most, an occasional wear; one of those scents one squirrels away with the emergency Zanax for a boost on a Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day. Available here.\nThis is for those nights when you want to leave a loud, sweet fug of rose and oud in the air as a calling card for the opposite sex. It\u2019s about as subtle as a baboon\u2019s arse, but there\u2019s something about the sweet, sour, and rotting notes in Al Sharquiah that gets people to lean in and sniff you twice. It smells like the fumes from a bag of slowly rotting Medjool dates mingling with oud, wilted roses, cooked rose jam, a hint of metallic smoke, and a bit of funk in the base courtesy of spiced-up woods.\nAlthough it\u2019s admittedly a quick snapshot of all the major themes in Arabian perfumery rather than the full deck, Al Sharquiah is a reasonable substitute for far more expensive Western takes on the rose-oud theme, such as Rose Nacr\u00e9e du Desert by Guerlain or Velvet Rose & Oud by Jo Malone. The whole orient for $4 a bottle? Hell yeah. I\u2019m not above wanting to feel like Scheherazade on the cheap every now and then. Available on Amazon.\nI\u2019m not terribly into vanilla, but when I need a hit, I reach for either the aromatic Eau Duelle (Diptyque), which smells like pine needles, frankincense, and black tea, or this, Black Flower Mexican Vanilla, which is spicy, smoky, and a little woody. Frankly, I would have recommended the Eau Duelle solid perfume had I been able to find it for sale anywhere, but I think this is also an excellent choice.\nMen who are askeered of vanilla, know this: the vanilla featured in this isn\u2019t the sugary, cupcake type of vanilla that makes you think of candyfloss and Barbie dolls, but instead the dry, woody scent of the vanilla bean itself. It is softly spicy, with accents of licorice and nutmeg, and the caramel is subtle \u2013 dry rather than syrupy. It\u2019s an excellent all-rounder vanilla, and if I were really confined to a choice of travel sizes or minis, then I know I\u2019d be perfectly happy with Black Flower Mexican Vanilla as my vanilla of choice. By the way, it\u2019s $35 for a 10ml rollerball of concentrated perfume oil, a price that includes international shipping (gasp!). Available here. Full review here.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " of scents I tend to be drawn to. Anything too floral and too strong smelling are definite nos.\nRecently a new store opened up in town, a store called Diptyque, a fancy french store that sells fancy scented candles, diffusers, perfume and de toilettes. A small candle costs about $28 while a large candle costs $60. So when I say \"fancy\" I mean \"faaaaancy\". I get my usual diffuser at a beauty store for $20, the diffuser lasts for quite a while, well over 6 months has been my experience- and so while $20 is, for me, quite expensive for keeping my bathroom smelling nice it is still worth the price when considering how long it lasts. So having spent $20 on diffusers in the past I decided to get a small candle ($28) to simply try it out. The selling point that worked on me? Scents such as \"fireplace\" and \"fig\", that's right, a candle that smells like you've got the fireplace going in your home, or the \"fig\" scent that smells like my fig tree in the backyard during fig season. The small candles probably will not last even close to 6 months but maybe the scent will turn me on to regularly spending $28 or $60, I suppose we'll see in not too long if Diptyque candles will make the cut, as for now...

From bold, neon-y Summer reds or glossy pinks and oranges, my picks will gravitate towards brown-ish nudes, deep reds and earthy oranges. Some of my picks are: my Tom Ford Lip Colour Shine in #05 Bare \u2013 the perfect transitional shade since it is a brown nude shade with some sparkles, the Burberry Lip Glow Nude Beige No.9 \u2013 can you tell I don\u2019t want to let go Summer yet?!, an old favourite of mine the Givenchy Le Rouge in #103 Brun Createur, the Charlotte Tilbury Walk of Shame a gorgeous Autumn colour with one the most comfortable matte formulation I have ever tried, another Burberry option \u2013 the Lip Cover Ruby No.18 because I can\u2019t live without my reds, the Est\u00e9e Lauder Pure Color Envy in #450 Insolent Plum another favourite from last year and a new discovery thanks to my lovely Janet, who was kind enough to send it over from across the Ocean \u2013 the Bite Beauty High Pigment Pencil in Sable.\nDeeper and darker nail polish colours are must-haves for Autumn. My two favourites are Dior Nuit 1947 ( #970 ) and Mirage (#338 ), previously reviewed here.\nAnother must have is perfume. I\u2019ll transition from fresh, zesty, floral perfumes like my Annick Goutal Eau d\u2019Hadrien and my Chanel No.5 Eau Premi\u00e8re to the deeper, dusty floral oriental notes of the Diptyque 34 BVLD Saint-Germain or the Maison Francis Kurkdjian Aqua Vitae Forte.\nThis Autumn I have a thing with hats! I love this Zara Narrow Brim Wool Hat that goes with everything and makes every outfit look classy and chic. More options here.\nI won\u2019t let go my favourite sunnies just yet, so I will always have with me my Ray Ban Aviators. A cult favourite piece.\nAnother must-have is a classic, timeless watch and my choice is my Daniel Wellington Classy Sheffield watch, which you can get for yourself with a 15% off, just by entering anniesbeautyblog discount code before check out! Available until 30 September 2015 \u2013 so hurry up! More details here!\nAnother fashion must-have is funky shoes!

I also can\u2019t live without my carbohydrates: bread, pizza and pasta! My kids and husband would say I can't live without my phone. I\u2019d agree with them. I love talking and keeping in touch with family and friends, but I also love the photos it takes. Some of my most precious memories were captured on my phone.\nCoffee, pasta, tomatoes, cheese, lemons, eggs, salami, olive oil, flour (for making pizza), and lots of fruits and vegetables. I also love chips, ice-cream and can\u2019t forget the chocolate. My favourite is Haigh\u2019s milk chocolate speckles. If I lived close to a store, I would buy them every week - lucky I don\u2019t!\nThe values I try to install daily in my life (and in my kids) are respect, compassion, loyalty, honesty and kindness. Always show respect and compassion. You may not always agree with someone, but you may learn something new by staying open-minded. Loyalty is also a big thing for me. I\u2019ve been taken advantage of in the past and had to learn hard life lessons about true friendships. And finally, always remember to be kind and honest to everyone. But especially to yourself.\nI like to sit in the sun with bare feet on the grass or sit on the sand and listen to music. You may find me just laying in bed, watching tv or a movie. Sometimes I go for a walk down the beach with a friend or just call them up for a chat. I love cooking. Especially when I make pizza. It\u2019s so calming kneading dough and lighting up the wood fire oven. There\u2019s nothing quite like watching the pizzas cook near the flames.\n6. What would your perfect day be like? Describe it.\nI wake up late on a warm, clear blue sky summer day. I enjoy a beautiful coffee, followed by a delicious bacon and egg breakfast. When lunch rolls around, I fire up the pizza oven and cook up a storm - surrounded by friends and family. We then relax around the pool. When the party's over, a magical fairy comes and cleans up the mess.\n7. What\u2019s in your bag right now?\nHand sanitiser and a mini bottle of my new favourite perfume, Diptyque Eau Capitale. I am obsessed with the scent.\n8. What is Mama best at?\nWe love making popcorn and eating ice-cream.\n10. What do you love about being a Mama?\nI love big hugs and kisses I get every morning. I love watching them learn something new. I love when they write me notes or make me something. I love watching the kid\u2019s eyes light up on Christmas morning. I love when they tell me they love me.\n11. What do you find the hardest thing about being a Mama?\nI don\u2019t get as much one on one time with my husband. I also miss not being able to go to the toilet or have a shower by myself.\n12. What are your go to beauty and favourite brands?\nI love makeup even though I don\u2019t wear it often (and I actually don't really know how to apply it very well). Currently, I love Giorgio Armani foundation, Kevyn Aucoin mascara, Hourglass primer and NARS blush and bronzer. For lipsticks, I love Tom Ford and NARS. I always use my Sante makeup removers every day - even if it is just to cleanse my skin.\n13. How do you manage to stay in shape?\nI enjoy Pilates, Boxing and walking with friends. It has never been about weight loss and physical appearance, I do it more for mental stimulation and socialisation.\n14. What are your favourite places to go in Sydney?\nWhen I\u2019m not visiting family in Annandale, I love going to Lucky Kennis Hairdressing in Mosman. Fortunately, the salon belongs to my best friend who spoils me. I also love going out for a beautiful dinner with my husband at Buon Ricordo in Paddington.\n15. What are your favourite things to do together?\nWe love travelling, dirt bike rides and going out for dinner together.\nWhen you travel with babies, the Babybjorn portacot is a great investment. It is light, easy to carry around, and has a thick mattress. It makes sleep time easy wherever you are. Since our babies were used to sleeping in this cot, it wasn\u2019t such a shock travelling.\nWhen you travel with children, remember to bring extra snacks, fruits and vegetables for the plane. I\u2019d also recommend cheap noise-cancelling headphones. Another great tip is to get study backpacks for the kids so they can carry their water bottles, headphones, neck pillows and toys. The deal is - whatever they bring, they must carry.\nTwo years ago we took the kids to Abruzzo in Italy. It\u2019s the birthplace of their grandfather. We had the best time in the village and can't wait to go back. We also enjoy going for mini-vacations to the family farm in the Blue Mountains.\nNatalie wears a Verse star necklace in 18k solid yellow gold.<|endoftext|>"

I normally use a diffuser (cold mist one) with oils so I can make my own scents.\nI've been gifted really expensive candles in the past, and honestly they just sit on the side gathering dust because I'm too scared to burn them just for burnings sake. I feel like i should save them for a special occasion which never comes. I'm happy with the cheap Aldi knock off from Jo Malone. Not scared to burn them just for me.\nI am not bothered about candles at all. I don't like the strong smells, and I always worry too much about the safety aspect of candles to find them relaxing.

Basically I like nothing too floral or perfumey. Something subtle and fresh.\nI hate Yankee candles, they are far too sickly sweet. I love Neom candles and the diffuser scents, they last for ages and the smell lingers well into the next day due to high essential oil content. Jo Malone doesn\u2019t tend to linger unless you get the intense ones and some of them you just can\u2019t smell at all, but IKEA does a great 3 wick dupe of lime, basil and mandarin.

But if you've been hesitant to splurge on a high-end candle, wait just a little bit longer \u2014 because Louis Vuitton's beautiful new candles are launching Nov. 5.\nThe premier release will feature four scents, each created by master perfumer Jacques Cavallier Belletrud, who drew inspiration from the outside scents that travel into homes on breezes. The collection is only the first release for Louis Vuitton's new candle line, with plans to continue to expand candles as a new category for the celebrated brand. World travel also play into the scents and can be found in the candle names: \"L\u2019Air du Jardin\", \"\u00cele Blanche\", \"Feuilles d\u2019Or\" and \"Dehors Il Neige\". The 220 gram candles will be available on Louis Vuitton's website and in select stores once released for $185.\nMany of the scents are classic candle smells taken to new heights by Belletrud. \"L\u2019Air du Jardin\" is inspired by spring and the smell of Proven\u00e7al roses, with Belletrud's expertise leading him to tackle the challenge of creating a rose-scented candle \u2014 a smell that can often be syrupy sweet or completely dull \u2014 by exhibiting a light touch. \"\u00cele Blanche\" is the collection's take on the varied island scent, and is noted to be anchored in fresh tea, with citronella, vervain, and jasmine sambac also in the mix. Walking through the forest inspired \"Feuilles d\u2019Or\", which combines patchouli, Virginia cedar, and incense to mimic the crisp feeling. Finally, star anise, cinnamon, and clean scents are in the wintery \"Dehors Il Neige\", which ends with a raspberry note.\nThe candles get their minimal look thanks to Marc Newson, the industrial designer behind Louis Vuitton Fragrance's simple glass bottles. The ceramic containers' wide brims allow better scent diffusion as well as make the candles practical keepsakes once totally burned. Focusing on the object's overall functionality also lead to riveting leather handles on each candle \u2014 a clever move that lets owners carry the candles without accidentally scuffing up the clean white porcelain. Calling it now: You will see empty Louis Vuitton candles hung by the leather straps as planters on interior decor blogs next spring.\nThere are also small details to the luxury candles that exist simply to wow you. Each scent has its own designated wick color, painted by artisan wax makers in Grasse; a fleeting detail that will vanish after the first burn. And if the candle's minimal take on Louis Vuitton's usually maximalist logo is too subtle for your taste, take note of the leather handles, which feature Louis Vuitton's signature yellow stitching and red edging.\nWith all eyes on the brand's bold Virgil Abloh release and recent street style-focused personalization options, the addition of candles to the home d\u00e9cor lineup is only one creative step of many that Louis Vuitton has taken in 2018. It's time to start guessing where the French fashion house will go next \u2014 and if it seems like a wild idea, you're probably correct.<|endoftext|>"

Although I\u2019m not religious, I do like to listen to Gospel on a Sunday too, it has such an uplifting effect and makes me feel good. It\u2019s a great start to the day and puts me in the right mindset. I\u2019ll get up feeling happy and make myself a tea, I love, love, love lemongrass \u2013 it\u2019s my thing. Then I get started on my routine. My background is beauty so I know how to take care of my skin and it\u2019s something I\u2019m really passionate about. I\u2019ll always start with a cleanse. I love the entire Elemental Herbology range, it\u2019s a natural and effective skincare line packed with active ingredients and so is really results driven. That\u2019s the kind of skincare I like. I start by massaging Elemental Herbology Vital Cleanse Facial Cleanser into damp skin and it gives a really thorough cleanse and removes all traces of dirt and makeup. I don\u2019t use a toner, so I pat my skin dry with my towel and follow with Elemental Herbology Facial Glow. I usually pop a small amount onto my fingertips and really massage it into my skin and then leave it on for about 10 minutes, during which time I\u2019ll switch on the morning TV and see what\u2019s happening in the world. If I have an upcoming event or want to up my skin game, I\u2019ll also use a mask. I do fluctuate between products as I\u2019m always testing out things that I\u2019ve been sent, but the mask I always go back to is Ren Glycolic Lactic Radiance Renewal Mask. My skin is pretty dry and dehydrated and this mask is instant and helps to rejuvenate a tired or dull-looking complexion. I usually leave it on for about 20 minutes or sometimes longer, I\u2019m one of those people who thinks the longer you leave things, the better.\nI\u2019m not really a bath person. I rarely have a bath, not even on a Sunday. In fact, the only time I might is in winter if it\u2019s really cold. I take a shower every morning and evening. In the shower I\u2019ll use a hydrating shower gel that\u2019s good for extremely dry skin, something like Ameliorate Nourishing Body Wash. When I get out the shower I have to moisturise my body immediately, if I didn\u2019t I\u2019d be extremely itchy.\nI only wash my hair at home once a week, and this is always in the morning because I am very sensitive and if I go to bed with even slightly damp hair I seem to end up with a cold. My hair is dry and frizzy so I am looking for softness and moisture from my haircare, but I don\u2019t want it to feel greasy. I like to use natural products like Leonor Greyl but it also has to smell fresh and clean without clashing with my perfume. Because I have to blowdry my hair on a really hot heat to straighten out the curl, I have to protect my hair with an oil or serum. I massage the oil into my scalp, because my scalp has a tendency to get really dry. Every now and then I\u2019ll use a hair mask or intensive treatment to restore shine and help with manageability.\nBefore bed I\u2019ll relax, watch a movie or read a book. My evening skincare routine on a Sunday is quite minimal, I\u2019ll freshen up with a quick cleanse, using Vital again and I\u2019ve recently started experimenting with oils. Even though I\u2019ve got dry skin, I\u2019ve always preferred cream textures over oils but I\u2019ve been massaging a couple of drops of hydrating night oil into my cheeks to relax my muscles for about three or four minutes and then I\u2019ll apply Aurelia moisturiser over the top. I always have a candle beside my bed. I\u2019m a Diptyque fan and anyone who knows me knows my home is surrounded with Diptyque in every room, pretty much. If I feel restless or anxious, I\u2019ll use the This Works Deep Sleep Pillow Spray and I do travel with it in my travel case because sometimes I hate flying and I fly a lot. If I feel a little bit agitated or anxious, that smell helps me to relax. I\u2019d like to try the De Mamiel Altitude Oil for flying, as I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s good. I switch out the lights between 10pm and 10.30pm and I sleep pretty well on a Sunday because I\u2019m calm and relaxed and have had all that quality time to myself.\nI always wake up at 5am. I don\u2019t use an alarm but I wake up at this time everyday.  Every single day without fail, I\u2019ll take three supplements; I take magnesium, iron and a probiotic for my healthy gut.  I generally feel good and excited, especially if the sun\u2019s shining. I think of Monday as a fresh start and an opportunity to accomplish whatever goals I\u2019m working towards. The only thing that tends to change in my Monday morning beauty routine is my makeup. I like to start the week off on the right foot and so my Monday outfit and makeup tends to be a bit more polished than the rest of the week. I over-tweezed my eye brows in my early teens, it was a disaster, so you\u2019ll never catch me anywhere without my brows on \u2013 if you did it would be like, \u201coh my god! Something\u2019s wrong.\u201d So I always fill them in with the Beauty Edit Mayfair Brow Pencil in Dark Dahlia \u2013 it\u2019s a really nice, rich chocolate brown colour and it\u2019s made with pure pigments so there\u2019s no red, grey or orange undertones that come through. I would say that\u2019s my hero, my beauty must-have. Before I leave the house I\u2019ll massage Aurelia Botanical Cream Deodorant into my skin so that it completely dissolves. It\u2019s unusual to what we\u2019re conventionally used to but I like the fact that it\u2019s natural and non-toxic and it works for me.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " predominant. Shiseido White Rose (courtesy of TPC)is a beautiful, ethereal rose. If it has a flaw, it is that it is quite subtle (no sillage monster here!) and not particularly long-lasting.\nElectron\u2026what do you think?\nI thought I\u2019d never be able to wear a rose soliflore until I tried Diptyque Eau Rose. It seems like exactly what I shouldn\u2019t like but I really do and I plan to give it major skin time this Spring. I guess this is the year of the rose for me because I also fell for Rose Oud, Loukham and Portrait of a Lady this past Winter. Im curious now about Rose Praline.\nIn general, I don\u2019t like rose perfumes. They are too sweet, too pretty, too insipid. There is one glaring exception, however, and that is MFK Lumiere Noire. For whatever reason, I love that perfume and think it smells just how rose should smell: dramatic, beautiful, and opulent.\nDavid Austen roses are marvellous!\nI love roses (as flowers), not just for the scent, but for the wonderful range of colors. Same with rose perfumes, but even though I can\u2019t single out a favorite petal color, I know my favorite rose perfume is Ta\u2019if, hands down.\nJoe mentioned Epic, which made me think of Jub25 \u2013 the rock rose comes through in the cream but the whole thing is so seamlessly done that you can\u2019t really tell one note from another \u2013 at least I can\u2019t. And that\u2019s just fine.\nRose d\u2019Ete is another favorite \u2013 greeny/citrusy rose that\u2019s perfect on a mid-spring day. It\u2019s the one Rosine where the rose takes a back seat to the other notes (at least a little bit) thus making it more wearable in hotter weather.\nWhat\u2019s so weird is I have always hated cumin and aldehydes, truly hated them, but I adore Jub25.\nAnd I was dying over those ottos, but I had nothing left to offer up!\nI don\u2019t *feel* like I\u2019m a huge rose fan either, but I always rose frags when I wear them\u2026 and I do really love several.\nJust the other day I received a gift decant of LL Baie Rose 26 and I think it\u2019s great. Other loves include Montale Black Aoud, Portrait of a Lady, Epic Woman (some don\u2019t feel this is so rosy?), Lyric Man, Coup de Foudre, and Une Zeste de Rose. So yeah, I really enjoy rose\u2026 it\u2019s just not what I think of myself reaching for frequently.\nThe accord also often tends to eat everything else in its path, so sometimes it\u2019s difficult to want that kind of focused commitment. I love when a perfumer manages to sneak the rose in there in subtle amounts \u2014 for that reason I love L\u2019Eau de Tarocco, which is such a perfectly balanced orange, saffron, and rose cologne for me. I think one could say the same about Safran Troublant and others where the rose barely peeks out.\nI love love LOVE Epic Woman but only get the rose in the shower gel and body cream. Perfume sprayed solo is gorgeous but mostly incense.\n\nI adore rose; it\u2019s probably my favorite note.\nBut oddly enough, I am almost completely anosmic to almost anything other than rose soliflores.\nI cannot smell it in most perfumes. I get no rose in L\u2019 Arte, PoaL, Rose Chypr\u00e9e,Lumiere Noire,Paris, even my beloved Joy, which is almost all jasmine on me.\nMy HG is AG Rose Absolu. I also love the Bvlgari rose, the Creed (dabbed, anyway; when sprayed it gets very citrusy on my skin) and Penhaligon\u2019s Elisabethan Rose. I like Serge\u2019s rose, and Malle\u2019s, but for the price, they don\u2019t really add much to what I already have.\n When something just has a rose note thrown in, I tend to experience it more as a bit of color or even flavor. Like I see the \u201cpink\u201d or the \u201cred\u201d in it, but it definitely doesn\u2019t smell like a living rose the way a good rose soliflore does. Geranium stands out more in compositions.\nI love rose fragrances, but do indeed have to be in the mood. SL Sa Majeste La Rose is gorgeous, and I\u2019m currently having fun with Keiko Mecheri\u2019s Gourmandises, which is a pretty-pretty rose that also somehow smells like jam. I also like the drydown of L\u2019Arte di Gucci quite a bit. For me, there\u2019s no getting around the fact that when I bend to sniff a rose, it\u2019s a pure and simple pleasure, and I think that always ends up being a component of my rose scent wearing experience.\nThen came Amouage Tribute Attar. The dried rose petals crumbling under the smoky bits caused me to rethink @};-\u2026and I\u2019ve been on a rose journey ever since.\nMe, too, me, too! I thought I did not like rose perfume, although you will frequently find me diving nose-first into a rose-bush (oh, Margaret Merrill, the sweetest, most wondrous thing I have ever grown). However, Amouage turned the trick along with Osmonde Jayne Taif \u2013 now strew my path with rose petals please.\nI like Rose best when it\u2019s blended with something else like Arpege or No. 19. Yesterday I wore EL Knowing, which is rose + green. I haven\u2019t explored rose very much yet, which is a surprise, cause I love the smell of real roses. Just not sure I want to smell like a rose. I\u2019ve tried a couple of roses that went sour on my skin, too, so that\u2019s made me a bit rose shy. (Voleur de Roses and Paestum Rose, iirc) I\u2019ll have to order a bunch of rose samples sometime and give them a try.\nDo you get rose in N\u00b019? That stuff is one of my holy grails, in edt and extrait, and I\u2019ve never picked it up. Interesting!\nI get powdery rose in the drydown of No. 19, after all the galbanum and iris have settled down. Can\u2019t say I\u2019m a big fan of that stage though. I love rose but not when it\u2019s too powdery.\nI love garden roses. But in perfume I guess I need to be selective. So many rose fragrances turn fruity sour on my skin. Kind of like the water that cut roses have been sitting in for a week, without being changed.\nPoAL was the first rose scent that didn\u2019t turn sour on me. But it took me almost a year to decide on it. Now it\u2019s my go to cold weather scent. On days I want PoAL but lighter, I use just the body cream. On me it\u2019s a patchouli rose. On my daughter it\u2019s this other worldly cinnamon, sandalwood rose. Mmmm.\nI would love to expand my rose scent wardrobe, but not sure what direction to go. Thought I liked L\u2019Artisan Voleur de Roses, but the last time I tried it the patchouli was amped and sour on my skin. Maybe I\u2019m just getting sour old lady skin. Sigh. I\u2019m leaning towards Le Labo Rose 31 right now. But I\u2019m also enjoying my sample of By Kilian Rose Oud. Hmm, maybe one of the travel sets in that?\nGlad you like Angeliques. That\u2019s another Malle I own and love. I find it very refreshing and crisp.\nThe bit about the standing vase water is exactly what I was trying to describe! Thank you!\nI love roses but like most of you, have to be in just the right mood to wear rose scents. I\u2019ve enjoyed Lancome\u2019s Mille et Une Roses and Body Shop\u2019s Moroccan Rose, as well as Stell Nude for these purposes. And on an unrelated note, now Patty has me lemming to try Angeliques sur les Pluies. Sigh.\nI love rose scents, but I don\u2019t reach for them very often. After about two hours on my skin, I\u2019m usually finished with them-they overwhelm me after a while. But for those two hours, here are some that I love: the gourmand Rosine scent that you mentioned is one-I believe it\u2019s Rose Praline? Rose de Nuit, Rose Oudby Kilian, Amouage Epic Woman, Parfums Delrae Coup de Foudre, the unreformulated Rose Poivree for my dose of dirty, skanked-up rose and others that I just can\u2019t recall at the moment. Right now, I\u2019m wearing Neela Vermeire Mohur. I think it\u2019s about to join the list of favorites. I read it as a light rose-leather-oud. And it\u2019s subtle and soft enough to wear to work. It\u2019s also so nicely blended that I don\u2019t tire of it after two hours.\nI<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "In an attempt to showcase its new fragrance trends and capabilities, fragrance manufacturer Givaudan held its first-ever U.S. pop-up in Greenwich Village called \u201cMy Bloom.\u201d The intent, however, was not for the public.\nHeld between Nov. 13 and 21, the invite-only pop-up brought together new and prospective clients to experience how Givaudan is adapting to trends, primarily by bringing its perfumers front and center. Givaudan, which creates fragrances for Diptyque, Victoria\u2019s Secret and Paco Rabanne, saw this pop-up as a way to understand shifts in the fragrance market and retain awareness within the business-facing fragrance industry. Givaudan is the largest flavor and fragrance producer with nearly 20% market share, followed by Firmenich, IFF and Symrise.\nThrough eight months of consumer studies, Givaudan found that 55% of U.S. women were no longer interested in sexy or glamorous fragrances, and preferred scent profiles that revealed a softer and more personal aesthetic from brands like Glossier and Diptyque. The New York pop-up had five stations focused on themes like self-love or memory, and was an iteration of a five-day, Paris pop-up held in October. Across both locations, 300 prospective and current clients, like Tom Ford Beauty and CBD brand Saint Jane, attended.\nEmily Bond, Givaudan head of fine fragrance North America also explained clients are looking for more innovative concepts and delivery methods with fragrance. Thus, the Greenwich Village pop-up, Givaudan showcased not only individual perfumers\u2019 creations, but also innovative experiences for smelling them including a scent wall and fragrance-infused ceramic discs instead of traditional testing papers or strips.\n\u201cWhat has overtaken the perfumery industry is a new way of scenting, borne out of a consumer\u2019s need for a different kind of product,\u201d she said.\nPredominantly, what this means is that Givaudan is attempting to understand the expansive but loosely defined natural and clean category. The product requirements from natural indie brands like Skylar and Phlur are forcing the manufacturing company to look at their products in terms of sustainability, veganism or organic. The company recently introduced an artificially intelligent program called Carto to help perfumers create new fragrances, as well as develop new biotechnologies for sustainability.\nThe rise of e-commerce and direct-to-consumer brands has also changed the relationship that customers have with fragrance, as they are not as likely to test and purchase products from department stores. This ultimately impacts Givaudan\u2019s clients and the demands placed on fragrance creators. This new dynamic was one of the driving reasons for hosting the pop-up offsite from holding meetings in its offices to remove clients\u2019 mindset from the boardroom and marketing, said Guggenbuhl.\nThe pop-up and its components took 18 months to produce. Givaudan declined to state the pop-up\u2019s investment, but the company reinvests 10% of its revenue into a research and development budget, from which the pop-up and its components were created. Givaudan saw fragrance sales increase by 8% year over year for the first nine months of 2019, according to its most recent earnings.<|endoftext|>"

A fresh eau for children with notes of sweet tangerine rind, lilac and benzoin.\n\"The Mom & Baby Water delicately perfumes skin and hair of both baby and mom. This sweet and powdery fragrance, with the scents of sweet almond, tender flowers and butter biscuit, will delight everybody. The alcohol-free, hypoallergenic formula is absolutely gentle on baby's skin. Enriched with naturally derived, moisturising* glycerine, as well as shea extract, it leaves the skin and hair soft and supple.\"\nFinally, if you'd rather not apply scent onto the skin of your baby, or simply are open to even more options, you can opt for a room fragrance specially created for nurseries and their dwellers.\n\"With an enchanting scent that is fresh, clean and completely irresistible, Thymes' delicate reed diffuser is a flame-free way to fragrance baby's room. The graceful bamboo reeds gently release the ever-so-light aroma...making baby's special place warm, welcoming and wonderfully scented.\nFragrance: An ever-so-light mist of powdery rose and jasmine with the softest hint of precious sandalwood and amber\"\nI absolutely love to put perfume on my little girl as a treat and now she's a bit older (she's 5) she adores it too and loves to decide which perfume she's going to wear. She even has a little collection of her own, though her favourite is Yves Rocher's Vanille Bourbon.\nOne point to mention is a difference in how we Europeans use colognes to freshen up. In all French bathrooms you will find a bottle of EDC which is used as a splash to cool down the skin during the day and add a little fragrance. I think there is a tradition of anointing babes in the same way, rather than using baby powder on them.\nFrench people tell me that for them, the scent of orange blossoms is the scent of childhood and babies, whereas Americans say it's Baby Powder.\nI have to confess that in my French bathroom I do have a bottle of eau de cologne and it is not Guerlain's but Bien-\u00catre EDC with verbena and vetiver which I use for all sorts of basic purposes including as a cleaning product, but I would not use it myself on a baby on a regular basis. It's one I am not afraid of letting take in the light it's so cheap. Yes, orange blossom is very much evocative of the scent of a nursery.\nI can very much relate to your scented interaction with your daughter. Although my son does not wear perfume he is very much interested in smells. The other day he was playing with a glass globe he was using to snuff out the Diptyque Roses candle to reproduce the experiment they did at school. I then showed him how it smelled inside the globe where the scent had concentrated. He asked if they made a strawberry scent (this struck me as it reminded me of the post on the strawberry-scented aromatherapy blend used to calm down kids' meltdowns). I then went to fish out precisely one of the Yves Rocher Les Plaisirs Nature I have, the closest one to strawberry, the raspberry one, which he enjoyed.\nIt's a very good line for children to play with and the little bottles are darling for kids.\nHaving said that, children can appreciate more sophisticated scents too as I discovered when my son said about Serge Lutens Serge Noire when it came out and he was 5-6 that it was \"very good\" and smelled like \"caramels in wine\"!!\ni am interested in branded baby perfumes.\nDo you mean, prestige baby perfumes? Guerlain have put out a new Petit Guerlain which is like a version of L'Heure Bleue for babies. Dolce & Gabbana have one too, but I haven't smelled it. Bonpoint is popular in France, both with moms and babies.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Whenever I am given a bouquet of roses, I instinctively lean in to smell them. What a disappointment! Most roses are bred to be completely scentless, and the only fragrance that clings to them is that of green foliage and wrapping paper. Being deprived of perfumed roses, I have a sentimental fondness for tea rose scents that remind me of freshly cut flowers. My most recent contender for a pretty English rose is Diptyque Eau Rose, a composition so uncluttered and straightforward that it manages to succeed where many rich blends fail.\nAt first glance, Eau Rose does not appear to be exciting\u2014it is a bright rose etude painted in pastel colors. What quickly becomes apparent is that it retains this effervescent, uplifting character throughout its development. The fragrance does not have any metallic sharpness that sometimes accompanies fresh rose notes, nor does Eau Rose veer into a powdery direction. It hums the same happy tune, but it sings well.\nEau Rose opens up on the zesty notes of lemon and bergamot, with the bright accent of crushed leaves. This lemon tea effect soon fizzles out and gives way to an airy rose impression. The first time I smelled Eau Rose, it reminded me of my favorite pick me up trick\u2014spraying my face with plain rosewater. Unlike rosewater, however, Eau Rose has decent lasting power and a good sillage. The drydown of musk and blond woods takes a while to reach, but it is so predictable that I do not regret having the rose linger longer on my skin.\nAlthough I like Eau Rose very much, it is not a masterpiece of rose perfumery. Unlike Diptyque\u2019s other rose, L\u2019Ombre Dans L\u2019Eau, it is less original and memorable. On the other hand, those who like fresh delicate rose blends will find it compelling for delivering what it promises\u2014the impression of holding a bouquet of fragrant pink roses. I do not know about you, but these days I rarely get to enjoy such a treat.\nSuzanna: This sounds ideal for spring. Better than the Jo Malone citronella-infused Red Roses that was last year\u2019s rose purchase.\nOperaFan: Dear V \u2013 What you just said!\nI like it very much for its straightforward simplicity. A rosewater that sticks.\nIt won\u2019t knock AG\u2019s Rose Absolue off its pedestal, but it\u2019s definitely a close relative and belongs in its company.\nVictoria: It is hard to find a fresh rose that is neither too metallic nor too green. So, while I\u2019ll be the first one to warn that Eau Rose is fairly simple, it is well-crafted and does what it promises.\nVictoria: You are the rose guru! \ud83d\ude42 Glad that you agree on the rosewater part. The first time I smelled Eau Rose at Saks, I felt as if I just splashed myself with rosewater. I came back for a sample and then compared it to my favorite Heritage rosewater brand.  It is a classic rose, simple and easy to wear. I have to mention the price is quite reasonable. Roll on EDT is about $50.\nVictoria: The commercial roses are bred mostly for looks and their lasting freshness, so the petals of these hybrids are so thick that even if they contained essential oils, they would be difficult to smell. That\u2019s one explanation I was given by the florist. Another is that the gene for fragrance in roses is recessive. If they are bred for scent, they lose on many other qualities that the consumers value. Sad, no?\nVictoria: Good point about the price! It is quite reasonable, and for a niche brand, even more so.\nL'Ombre Dans L'Eau always scores top points for originality. I get so many compliments on it, but unfortunately, I find it hard to wear. Just too green and resinous.\nbulldoggirl: I love the smell of roses and am amazed at how varied they can be in real life. I do my sniffing at a local library\u2019s rose garden and nearly all the blooms are vividly scented. My favorite is a deep red hybrid tea whose smell is unbelievable\u2013rich and spicy and unlike anything I\u2019ve ever smelled.\nVictoria: This party never ends! \ud83d\ude42 How interesting about colorful roses being less fragrant. You know, the roses used for the perfume industry are not particularly brightly colored. They do not have much in terms of looks, but the scent\u2026. I have a bag full of rose buds from my last trip to Grasse this summer, and although the flowers are dry and faded, the scent is still very strong.\nVictoria: My favorite rose perfumes are usually those that blend roses with the oriental, sweet or woody notes: Portrait of a Lady by Frederic Malle, L\u2019Artisan Voleur de Roses, Ormonde Jayne Ta\u2019if. It is such a winning combination. I like rose scented dessert for same reason. I even have an Omani bread recipe that is scented with saffron and rosewater. It has been on my list of recipes to try for a while, so I hope to do so this weekend.\nPerfumista8: Thanks so much for the suggestions, Victoria. I have several of the Annick Goutal\u2019s and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the one rose scent that finally works is from their line.\nVictoria: I haven't smelled it recently, but fragrances are constantly reformulated, so if that's what happened, I wouldn't be surprised.\nVictoria: Thank you very much, Kelly!\nMichelle: I just purchased Eau Rose and I just love it.\nIt reminds me of YSL Paris, but prettier. It smells current and not old fashioned. A beautiful scent indeed.<|endoftext|>"

Whether it be a super nourishing, luxurious body cream or a red lipstick that perfectly cushions the lips, some products just have that special touch. It makes sense, therefore, that in times like these, I\u2019m turning to such products more so than ever in a bid to lift my spirits.\nSimilarly, with spending more time at home than I\u2019m used to, I have also been finding ways to inject some joy into my surroundings. After several homeware orders, I\u2019m actually starting to run out of space. So last week, as I perused my beauty shelves, I had a eureka moment. Instead of keeping all of my most beautiful, mood-lifting beauty products behind closed doors to experience one once or twice a week, why not keep them out on display for all of the world to see (well, just me for now)?\nWith the rise of social media platforms like Instagram, aesthetics and packaging have a bigger role to play than ever when it comes to the success of a beauty product, and I\u2019m not complaining. As every new launch gets prettier and prettier, it seems such a waste to hide them, no? So if you like the idea of your beauty products doubling up as chic ornaments for your dressing table, keep scrolling.\nWhen I heard that fashion label La Double J was collaborating with one of my favourite cult beauty brands of all time, I knew it was going to be good. Oh wow, was I right. I have had this fresh and zesty body lotion out on display since I got it, and I never want to let it go.\nSuper chic, yes, but this mask is also my absolute go-to for glowy, nourished skin.\nName a chicer beauty brand than Diptyque. Known mostly for its beautiful candles and perfumes, this French brand is a favourite among fashion girls. However, if you really want to up the ante, this new glass-bottled hand lotion is absolutely divine.\nI have always been a big lover of Loewe\u2019s understated, chic perfume bottles, so when I first saw this one, I was a little surprised. With that being said, this summery, uplifting scent is like happiness in a bottle.\nThese just might be the most ludicrously expensive lipsticks I have ever tried, but if you\u2019re serious about feel-good beauty, they\u2019re also some of the best. Pretty enough to look at all day, this buttery orange shade is also a total treat to use.\nWhile applying makeup isn\u2019t at the top of most people\u2019s agendas right now, this super-luxe powder palette actually makes me want to sit down in front of the mirror. Plus, the brightening powders give skin the most unbelievable glow.\nAgain, this one is mega-pricey, but it\u2019s also really great. It\u2019s up there with one of the best skincare products I own for no-fuss nourishment, and it\u2019s also incredibly pretty. Do I recommend you spend \u00a3180 on a face serum? Never. But you can definitely appreciate just how pretty it is, right?\nNail polish doesn\u2019t tend to be the prettiest thing to look at, but I love these understated bottles. As a big bonus, the formula is a long-lasting dream too.\nYou might have seen this on Instagram already, and I have to admit, I\u2019ve yet to try this one. The thing that caught my attention, though? The chic packaging, of course.\nNot only is this Susanne Kaufmann bath oil just about the most relaxing I have ever gotten my mitts on, but it\u2019s also the prettiest bathroom shelf accessory.\nNo chic dressing table is complete without a jade roller.<|endoftext|>"

These are also known as nocturnal, yin, negative, feminine and even-numbered signs of the zodiac.\nThe earth sign Taurus loves comforting scents. Earthy scents will keep the ambitious Taurus grounded. Try Emily Weiss' Glossier You fragrance -- a soothing concoction of warm musk mallow and iris root. It is described as something \"wildly familiar and sexy like the smell of your boyfriend's neck after wearing cologne all day.\"\nTaurus also gives in to luxurious and sensual scents like Vanilla. Try candy-like scents like Prada Candy Night that smells like chocolate, or a less intimidating vanilla-infusion like Juliette Has a Gun Vanilla Vibes. Ellis Brooklyn Sci-Fi is a concoction of earthy and vanilla scents for the best fragrance for the Taurus sign.\nCancer is known for its loyalty, so they are likely to stick to a signature scent. Try fragrances that are nostalgic like Diptyque's L'eau de Neroli that smells of warm and familiar, old holiday memories.\nCoconut and Lily of the Valley fragrances also suit the traits of the Cancer sign. Try Ariana Grande's new fragrance Thank U, Next or be inspired by the utterly feminine scent of Mugler Les Exceptions Wonder Bouquet. If those scents are too strong, opt for a balance of floral and musk like the fragrance Miu Miu Twist.\nVirgo is gentle and kind, making floral scents work well with them. Try a sophisticated feminine scent like Ralph Lauren Woman, or a clean scent infused with Cedarwood for the sign that likes to take control.\nTry warm woods and soft familiar floral scents like Kai*Rose Eau De Parfum or Herm\u00e8s Un Jardin sur la Lagune.\nScorpio is passionate and emotional, so a seductive scent like musk is the most wearable fragrance for this sign. It's also soothing, which makes it a good fragrance to tone down the intensity of Scorpio.\nTry a daytime scent like Pure Musc for Her by Narciso Rodriguez, a soft and powdery scent or try a flirtatious fragrance like Huda Beauty Kayali Musk 12.\nRealistic and sensitive Capricorn are keen to find the finest scent. Try a sumptuous bottle of Lost Cherry Tom Ford Perfume, a new heady floral fragrance of Turkish rose and jasmine Sambac for those who want the finer things in life.\nIf you're not a fan of florals, try the masculine scent of Vetiver like Maison Louis Marie No.04 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum that combines amber and sandalwood.\nPisces are mysterious and spiritual. Try a frankincense fragrance like Vitruvi Frankincense Essential Oil for simplicity or a more extravagant concoction for dreamers like Goutal Nuit et Confidences Eau De Parfum.\nThis article is part of a two-post series.

Whether you're looking for a house-warming gift or a Christmas gift, these are the best scented candles you can't go wrong with. From Jo Malone to Diptyque, Neom, Jo Loves, and the new Boy Smells.\nWe all have that one friend who's obsessed with candles, and if you don't - and you're reading this - it's probably you. As we all spend more and more time in our homes amid the pandemic, the luxury of burning a gorgeous candle is a weekly highlight. Whether you're on this page looking for candle inspiration for yourself, or shopping for a thoughtful gift for a loved one, we promise you can't go wrong with any of these suggestions.\nYou can't have a candle roundup and not include Jo Malone London, can you? It's synonymous with thoughtful gifting. This year's Christmas gift offering is a special one as well. Introducing the Pine & Eucalyptus home scent which is bursting with the festivity of aromatic pine and enlivening eucalyptus. Candle burn time is approximately 45 hours.\nDiptyque and Christmas go together like a Bailey's and ice - it's a match made in heaven. This delightful Christmas edition is a dreamy blend of citrus, orange, cinnamon, ginger and amber, and makes for a delightful addition to your Christmas centrepiece. What's more, you can also buy a carousel on the Diptyque website that's sold separately and it gently rotates with the heat of the flame to cast a yuletide landscape across your living.\nNeom's new candles for Christmas have such positive vibes and we're loving it. This one is a limited edition candle blended with pine, myrrh and fresh lime peel, plus 22 other essential oils.\nInspired by Jo's family holidays in Italy, Fig Trees captures the fresh green scent of ripe figs alongside sweet cassis and the eathy warmth of amber - you'll be transported straight to the Mediterranean.\nIf you're looking for the ultimate chic candle that's a little off the beaten track, look to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle who describes the scent of 'Cafe Society' as the \"ephemeral odour of the living room a few minutes after the end of a Parisian dinner when the guests have just left.\" Is that not fabulous? Developed by perfumer Carlos Bena\u00efm, it features Wood, Citrus and soft floral accords. The pretty red vessel perfectly accents kitchen or dining room tables.\nLong winter nights call for warming company. The Penhaligon's Elixir candle is just the thing. With its heady, spiced aroma of rose, eucalyptus, jasmine, incense and wood, you'll feel warm and cosy in no time.\n\nBoy Smells is a cult LA brand that has just arrived here in the UK, and it's super chic. The cool, genderless candles started as an experiment in candle-making from the Los Angeles kitchen of co-founders, and real-life partners, Matthew Herman and David Kien in 2016. Cinderose features rose, tuberose, oakmoss and smoke - it's a heady combination that any friend of yours would love.\nRose is the perfect scent for a gift - who doesn't love the smell of fresh roses? This one from Floral Street has a soft rose core, latticed with raspberry, violet and patchouli. It's both powerful and energetic.\nThis is a cult scent for a reason! Le Labo's Santal 26 is smoky and leathery, but still gentle enough not to overpower. The style mavens of Instagram love this brand and it's on every fashionista's wish list.\nThis is described as a winter's bouquet of crisp narcissus set amongst smoky woods - sounds irresistible, does it not?\nIf you're looking for the ultimate luxe candle for a Christmas gift - how about Sisley? Inspired by Soir d\u2019Orient eau de parfum, the Orient scented candle from Sisley transports you to a palace in the Far East. With notes of saffron, clove and patchouli, you have a beautiful heady, woody fragrance to fill the room. What's more, it's housed in a laquered matte black case with crimson red wax.\nThis Baccarat Rouge 540 candle was born after an encounter between Maison Francis Kurkdjian and Maison Baccarat.

We stopped by Diptyque too and picked up a few things including a Ceramic Candle Snuffer and the new Do Son Hand Cream.\nOur must-visit places include The Salty Donut, Zak the Baker and Joe\u2019s Stone Crab (I always get their crab cakes). We also love the tacos at Bodega Miami and the food at Call My Gaby is next level amazing. They have this amazing meatball appetizer that I can\u2019t stop thinking about!\nI\u2019ve saved the best for last! The Vizcaya Museum and Gardens has been on my list for years and this is the first time I planned in advance and ordered tickets. I\u2019m not sure if this is always the case but tickets are sold online only right now. We saw them turn away visitors at the booth who did not have tickets. While some areas in Florida (and maybe where you are too) no longer require masks, some do. This was one of them, even outdoors. The place is beautiful! I highly recommend visiting. A number of areas were undergoing renovations so there were some places we did not get to see.

I\u2019ve done quite a few reviews in the past. If you want to see what I can fit inside you can find previous posts by clicking on my Packing Tag.\nDimensions are 7\u2033 x 5\u2033 x 3\u2033+ latest version reviewed here.\nAlso thought it was fun to share that Away featured me on their website!

I\u2019ve put quite a few to the test over the years and I\u2019m rounding up the ones I swear by to haul around my makeup for travel. I\u2019ve tried so many different brands, sizes and styles over many trips. I\u2019m constantly testing different shapes in search of the best ones to pack my makeup. Finding the best makeup bag for me depends on trip length and destination. I like to have different options for makeup vs. skin and hair as I keep things separated by product type so it\u2019s easier for me to find things. I also like flat zip or snap closure pouches to carry around with me as well. Today I\u2019m sharing the three travel pouches I brought with me on my most recent trip along with more thoughts and comparisons on a few different styles/shapes.\nThe Daily Edited makes some of my favorite travel makeup cases. They functional, chic, well made and I love the personalization options! I really love their Large Cosmetic Case. It\u2019s roomy with a wide base so I can fit quite a bit inside. I own this in a couple colors and I\u2019ve brought this one on every single trip since I purchased it in fall 2017. It has a saffiano textured finish and both have held up really well. Another one of my favorites is their Transparent Cosmetic Case for an affordable option to the Anya Hindmarch Inflight Bags. You can read the review plus comparison in this post here. Quick note that since I bought mine The Daily Edited has changed the design slightly of the trim which you can see on their website. I usually bring the transparent one with me as well but there was a new bag from Truffle that I wanted to try this trip.\nCloser look at The Daily Edited Large Cosmetic Case in Black ($100). I picked the smaller font option with blind embossing. It measures 5.3\u2033 high x 8.9\u2033 wide x 4.3\u2033 deep.\nTruffle has been a long time favorite as well \u2013 I carry their flat pouches with me pretty much everywhere I go. I have them in my purse, in my gym bag and they are always part of my travel uniform. I\u2019ve used these for years and found that their plastic material and leather has held up really nicely even with regular use. Similar to any clear material the plastic will get get dirty with smudges but it\u2019s easy to clean. I clean mine with Novus Plastic Clean and Shine every once in a while and it removes all the sand, debris and smudges. For travel I always pack their Clarity Jetset Case with me. They\u2019re small enough to throw in my tote for day-to-day. They\u2019re also good for bringing some inflight essentials with you. For ideas on how to use it, you can see what I packed inside for our California trip last year in this post here. I also pack my on-the-go fitness beauty essentials inside it for when we go out and run. Truffle just launched a Clarity Jumbo Jetset Case which is a larger version and has two zip around compartments. It\u2019s longer and deeper so can fit more things like longer makeup compacts (I put my Naked Reloaded inside and it fit perfectly!). One half has an elastic band to help hold things in place.\nThe third thing I never leave home without is a flat clear pouch. Ouai also makes some of my favorite clear envelope pouches. Every time I feature one I\u2019m asked by everyone where it\u2019s from! There are two sizes, a Mini Envelope Clutch ($15) and a Larger Envelope Clutch ($25). They are so convenient to travel with because you can see everything inside it! I\u2019ve found them on their website, unfortunately they\u2019re frequently sold out, the larger one is in stock right now on the US site, mini is available on their UK site. I\u2019ve seen them restock a number of times in the past on the US website so I\u2019d recommend keeping an eye if you have this on your wishlist. I also really love the Truffle Clarity Clutches in Small and Mini sizes to throw in my travel bag. Long time readers know these are always with me!\nThe Daily Edited Large Cosmetic bag is my favorite makeup bag for traveling. It\u2019s quite roomy and the shape works well for my travel style and needs. It can hold a lot of minis, compacts, lipsticks etc. The only downside is there isn\u2019t really a separate compartment for things like brushes. If you like a large open compartment style bag this is the best one I\u2019ve tried.\nTruffle\u2019s Clarity Jumbo Jetset Case is the largest option I own. It\u2019s long enough to hold compacts like Urban Decay\u2019s Naked Palette with extra room. The elastic strap in the bottom is handy but pretty stretchy. I like that it has a handle on one end but that still lies flat against the bag. Since it\u2019s bigger it can hold more liquids and stack more products inside. The price is on the high side but<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Discover the beauty and essence of unspoilt nature with the Diptyque Eau De Toilette Vetyverio, a fragrance that is inspired by the botanical name for vetiver. Vetyverio brilliantly amalgamates the essence of vetiver and other blossoms to offer a magnificent, surreal eau de toilette.\nThe top notes come with Italian mandarin, Indonesian nutmeg and Floridian grapefruit while the middle notes consist of Turkish rose, Egyptian geranium, French carrot seed and Madagascan ylang-ylang. The base notes come from Virginia cedar, vetiver from Haiti and Java as well as white musk, rising to make this a complete fragrance.\nThe fragrance\u2019s strong sensations and contrasting temperatures are sure to help relax and calm the user.\nEscape to an exotic Southeast Asian island with Vetyverio, a fragrance that beautifully blends fresh fruity notes with the woody, spicy and floral. This multi-faceted, androgynous scent is rugged and unique. From the legendary French perfume house of Diptyque, Vetyverio is worn and adored by both women and men. The complex, finely-crafted arrangement of notes creates a fragrance that is utterly compelling.\nApply perfume to pulse points such as the inner part of your elbow and back of your knees, wrist, neck and cleavage. Pulse points create heat, so the fragrance emits a stronger scent. \nVetyverio Eau de Toilette is rated 4.5 out of 5 by 22.\nRated 5 out of 5 by HannahK from The only fragrance in my life! I got a sample of this when I was in Paris and wasn\u2019t flush enough to buy it for a few months. I thought about it every day even smelling the card every now and then for a fix. Finally bought the 100ml and have no regrets or buyers remorse. The first day I wore it my friend noted I smelled \u201cexpensive\u201d which just made me love it more. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever change fragrances.\nRated 5 out of 5 by angieW from Just right I bought a discovery set of ten different Diptyque scents and used them all for a week each. This one is my favourite by a long way. I can't think of an occasion for which it would not be right. It's interesting and fresh and warm and homely and unobtrusive without being boring. It's become my signature scent, and I don't feel me without it now!\nRated 4 out of 5 by coco2 from Favourite Scent I am a big fan of Diptyque, and have tried many of their products. This is basically my favourite - I echo other reviewers in that the warm masculine initial notes melt into this beautiful, sophisticated rose floral. Absolutely gorgeous, perfect from spring and summer. The scent could have better longevity however.\nRated 5 out of 5 by emilybusson from Amazing perfume! Had this perfume for a few years now and still smells as it did when i bought it. Such a unique smell that changes over time and smells different on everyone I spray it on. It's so light and easy to wear all throughout summer, but it's also powerful enough to be worn in winter. Love it!<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Also enjoy Imaginary Authors Slow Explosions.\nlimegreen: I enjoy Jo Malone Cologne Intense Saffron but it may be discontinued.\nCelle: Hi all, I have been looking for the perfect green scent next to my no.19 edt and received quite a few suggestions here. Now I must say I\u2019ve found that missing piece. It\u2019s Ninfeo Mio of Annick Goutal \u2013 very grassy, and the lemon verbana note just balanced out the fig so that it wasnt overly sweet or coconuty like Philosykos. it may not be a photorealistic rendition of the fig, but still I like it so much for its very green nuances.\nNow I\u2019m looking for something warm, woody and have good sillage. Something for the cold weather probably. For this bottle i do not want a gourmand (as I have my favourite gourmands already ). Fille en Aiguilles looks nice but somehow my local counter said it\u2019s discontinued after the repackaging into 100ml bottles (who needs that much?).\nKatya: My favourite cozy scents are Chanel Eau Premiere, and Coco (the original), both very warm and yummy. For more woody ones, I have my eye on Fragonard\u2019s Santal, so that may be worth checking out \u2013 that, or Cedre. Santal is what keeps me from committing to a bottle of No19 actually \u2013 I always feel like why get the more expensive one when I can get something really good for 26 quid? I notice when I\u2019m sampling, no19 disappears quickly, but I get whiffs of Santal on my clothes for days after.\nJohn: I swear I\u2019m not in the pay of Caron (I just recommended this a few posts up), but have you tried Yatagan? The overlap of incense, conifer and castoreum is wonderfully rugged, but its sheerness stops it from being overbearing.\nlimegreen: I agree! Yatagan always makes me smell the high altitude pine forests in the Rockies. It\u2019s a dry and not wet evergreen smell, just lovely.\nlimegreen: I\u2019ve been in love with Parfum d\u2019Empire Corsica Furiosa, with a green mastic thingy going on. It is a very satisfying strong green for me, not too cold and doesn\u2019t smell like pine cleaner!\nIt\u2019s not Xmas tree wintry though.\nAurora: Hello Anu: so sorry for you about Winter Delice, yes, Guerlain always discontinue their Aqua Allegoria editions (with 3 or 4 exceptions).\nCornelia Blimber: Absolutely no boundaries!! I wear Heritage, Van Cleef Pour Homme, Dior Homme Intense, and many other perfumes for men. And I know lots of men wearing perfumes for ladies.\nJohn: I\u2019d say no boundaries!\nI love Noa by Cacharel, it has such an innocent perfume.\nI second L\u2019eau d\u2019Hiver and add Dans tes bras and En passant from Frederic Malle\u2019s line as they are both tender and romantic to my senses.\nLa chasse aux papillons is the happiest, mood-lifting tender scent I know.\nKatya: Do Son by Diptyque is very tender white floral (tuberose) that always rakes in the compliments for me. Always. Friends, relatives, strangers in the dressing rooms. My mother loved it so much she wanted a bottle for herself, as did one of my mother\u2019s friends.\nI also recently tried Diptyque Olene (on recommendation from one of these threads) and it is a beautiful jasmine that reminds me so much of green tea and springtime walks. Admittedly it turns a bit medicinal if I\u2019m too heavy-handed with it but maybe it\u2019s a good one to just mist over yourself.\nCornelia Blimber: Tender and romantic\u2026maybe Baiser Vol\u00e9 (Cartier).\nOr Lys Soleia (Aqua Allegoria).\nFlora Nymph\u00e9a (AA) is wonderful but discontinued; I read that Chanel Beige comes near.\nspe: Thank you, Cornelia. Which formulation of Baiser Vole is your preference?\nBeige becomes too sweet for me.\nCornelia Blimber: I love the edp Baiser Vol\u00e9, never smelled the extrait.\nYou are right (IMO), L\u2019Air du Temps doesn\u2019t age well. I remember the vintage perfume very well, my mother wore it.\nNotturno7: Hi Spe, did you try Misia? It seems to hit the description of what you\u2019re looking for.\ni\u2019d like a feminine perfume that smells kind of \u201cpharmaceutical\u201d and rose(the way midnight poison-dior used to smell).\ni dont really like heavy oriental frangrances or to sweet and i m in my early 30s!\nKayliz: Hm. Pharmaceutical and rose, for me, is Cologne pour le Soir by Maison Francis Kurkdjian \u2014 but it is sweet (and dense, and animalic in a beeswax way).\nEudora: Hello, I didn\u2019t know about Nivea eau de toilette. I love the classic in a blue jar body cream, so nostalgic, from my childhood. Has any of you tried it?  I would spray my pillow every day!\nkpaint: The other night after I sprayed myself with Lorenzo Villoresi Teint de Neige, I got to thinking about how nice it would be if it were shot through with a big dose of rose.\nmaja: Iris Rose by Coudray, very powdery and rosey.\nEudora: Not a perfume but what a coincidence. I bought Nuxe Lotion Tonique Douce aux petals de rose, a very gentle toning lotion for sensitive skin and it smells powder and rosa damascena. It is a pleasure!\nAurora: I absolutely 2nd Maria about Ombre Rose, if you like \u2018retro\u2019 scents \u2013 now I want to try Drole de Rose too.\nAnn: Do you have or have you tried?\nkpaint: I\u2019ve tried AP and the Narciso. I\u2019ve never smelled any Terry de Gunzburg perfumes, though I\u2019ve heard good things about them. Is it one you wear? I\u2019ll look into the Lalique.\nAnn: I don\u2019t wear it, I\u2019ve just smelled it.\nspe: With the possible exception of La Myrrh by Lutens, everything has less aldehydes than No. 22.\nHowever, I do think No. 22 is one of the most beautiful fragrances on the planet.\nkpaint: I\u2019d agree that if you like big, heady, white florals, Carnal Flower should be on the list to try. I get a lot of jasmine from it on my skin.\nkpaint: Ah, if the Hermes is too green, the Piguet (we\u2019re talking Fracas here, right?) is probably way too green then \u2013 not that I\u2019d discourage anyone from trying Fracas!\nSilvermoon: Dana, yes, it probably is fair to describe WGP like that. If you really love warm perfumes, it probably isn\u2019t for you. On the other hand, Maai is an utterly warm, deep and almost heavy perfume. Go lightly!\nI\u2019m soliciting recommendations for woody perfumes for spring/summer. Or which non-woody perfumes would you recommend someone wear in spring/summer if their preferred note is woody?\nCornelia Blimber: L\u2019Air du Temps is difficult, I agree. I had a vintage L\u2019Air du Temps, but it smelled like Bayer aspirine. All my perfumes aged well, save L\u2019Air du Temps.\nCarina: Hello people!\nI\u2019d like to ask please for someone to recommend me a fragrance. The question is I am obsessed with No 5 edt, and although I really love Shalimar too I can\u2019t find another perfume I love so much as No5 edt.\nI want to open up my horizons a bit, and although I really love Les Exclusifs by Chanel I cant afford them.\nAna: Hello, I\u2019m joining you comment since I\u2019m also a big No. 5 EDT lover, and I want to try something new. In fact, I was considering Shalimar as an option.\nMy other favorite fragance is J\u2019adore, which I find has a strong jasmine note.\nEastofeden: Okay I\u2019m coming to this party a bit late. But I am looking for a scent to gift to my son, a 22 year old college student.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "If you've been following this blog, you'll have noticed the epiphany that went down when I discovered Le Labo's candles. Having long been a fan of A.P.C candles and sometimes Diptyque candles and even the occasional experiment due to a tempting department store offer leading me to try for instance a Laura Mercier candle, the lightning bolt that struck the day I walked headlong into the Le Labo underworld and discovered what they do and how carefully they do what they do, was a line in the sand moment. After that, well, there's been no turning back on the candle frontier. It's Le Labo or no candle at all.\nPart of that Le Labo epiphany was about going into their petite, angular London boutique just off Marylebone High Street and having the lovely experience of meeting Camelia, who is very much an embodiment of Le Labo the brand and also a fabulously warm and inviting ambassador for Le Labo as a luxurious, life enhancing experience. Instead of being harassed and rushed through a purchase, which is the norm in most stores these days, Camelia took her time initiating me as a consumer/ customer/ guest/ pleasure seeker, into Le Labo's mysterious, heady wonderland vibe and sent me home with a Pin 12 vintage candle. The cumulative experience that afternoon was not just of buying a candle or discovering what Le Labo is about, it was also somehow about beginning a friendship with Le Labo, Camelia and the London boutique, which in this hurry-convenience-download-hustle bustle era, seems entirely unique.\nAs I've already blogged about, the Pin 12 candle called back childhood memories of Mallorca for me and I was frankly surprised that a candle could work up such powerful images, emotions and memories. Camelia had explained that Le Labo candles go way beyond what you usually get from any other candle and she wasn't kidding: you don't light a Le Labo candle and have it politely tiptoe about your home - when you light a Le Labo candle, you're inviting both a dominant luxury to sprawl out across your home and also for your senses to be dialled up the way the very best films, books, photographs, paintings, songs, albums, dial up your senses.\nBy the time the Pin 12 vintage candle flickered for a final time, I was completely hooked and a return trip to the Le Labo store resulted in moving on from the Pin 12 vintage candle to trying the Santal 26 classic candle which was deeply heady - think Leonard Cohen's voice pumped through a Moroccan riad - and caused everyone who dropped by to say, Wow, what's that amazing smell? Every time I lit that candle, I have to say the experience felt special, always like a treat. And the scent lingered at all times, like it was a bank of perfumed fog that had rolled in and then been held on pause. I blogged about the delights of that candle too, the post's here if you didn't catch it.\nDeepening the Le Labo loving, I also read a bunch of interviews online with Le Labo's founders, Fabrice Penot and Eddie Roschi and found myself really admiring the company they've built, their focus, their attention to detail, their dedication in the way they started Le Labo, their commitment to animal cruelty free production/ products, their A.P.C-esque disinterest in conventional marketing/ advertising formulas, their business savvy (all that consultancy work helping Le Labo grow) and above all, their pure vision which permeates and characterises every corner of what they're doing and making.\nWhile buying the Santal 26 candle, Camelia had mentioned that she also highly rated the Figue 15 candle - which worked like a cunning subliminal plant over the next month. I was often thinking that since Camelia's recommendations so far had been so perfect, there was no rational reason not to take her lead again and move next time to trying the Figue 15 candle. Adding to that, I adore figs anyway - with crumbled cheese, with goat's cheese, drizzled with honey, with a good yogurt, tossed with toasted nuts - which meant I was basically sold long in anticipation of the Santal 26 candle coming to an end.\nThen it happened, the Santal 26 candle did come to an end and a few days later, as a birthday treat, I dropped by the boutique and Camelia once more hosted me and my daughter (who's now a dedicated Le Labo fan at the age of eight) and it felt ever-more like we'd dropped by to say hello to a new friend we're incrementally getting to know and as had been set in motion by Camelia the time before, we of course left carrying a bag and inside the bag, was a beautifully wrapped and packaged Figue 15 classic candle.\nMy thoughts on the Figue 15 candle so far? Well, where the Pin 12 and Santal 26 transported me away into a travel realm - to Mallorca, to Morocco - the Figue 15 is fresh and beautiful and sweet and breezy and grounding and comforting and transports you deep inside yourself. It's somehow a kind of spiritual experience; an internal pleasure. Every time I've lit this Figue 15 candle, I feel refreshed, yet also inwards looking. It's like meditation, like yoga, like the point in a Pilates mat class when you zone fully into that profound sense of inner intuition. And whichever room you light it in, it makes you smile, really profoundly smile.\nLe Labo Figue 15 Classic Candle (Thanks Again To C...<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " Foudre \u2014 that is, I think it's a well-made, light, sheer (yet expensive) rose perfume. It has a fleeting top note of bergamot, but the main idea is a fresh rose note (definitely a pink rose!), backed up by some dewy peony and some slightly sharp lily of the valley. The lily of the valley actually seems to persist longer than the other floral notes, and the musk in the base is transparent and cool. Rosa Nobile has moderate sillage and below-average staying power for an Eau de Parfum. It's definitely pretty; it just lacks any mystery or depth or glamor for me.\nTo paraphrase what I wrote in a review of Roses de Chlo\u00e9 back in February, if you enjoy Diptyque Eau Rose or Caron D\u00e9lire de Roses, you might like Rosa Nobile too. Then again, if you already own Eau Rose (as I do) or D\u00e9lire de Roses, you might not bother to add something similar to your collection. I've been a fan of Acqua di Parma for years; I like its combination of retro style (e.g., its classic Colonia) and contemporary luxury (the Blu Mediterraneo collection). I used to own and love Iris Nobile, but I'm just not very excited by the brand's more recent soliflores. For a simple rose with lily of the valley, I'd sooner choose YOSH Sottile, which melds better with my skin.\nMeanwhile, in Paris, Les Parfums de Rosine has launched Ballerina No. 1, the first of a promised duo of fragrances inspired by dancers. Ballerina No. 1 comes clothed in its own little tutu, and the scent inside includes top notes of pear, peach, freesia and bergamot; heart notes of rose, peony, violet and raspberry; and base notes of milk, vanilla, musk and sandalwood. It was developed by perfumer Delphine Lebeau. According to the Rosine website, it personifies a \"mischievous and delicate\" young ballet dancer.\nThat description suits Ballerina No. 1, which turns out (unsurprisingly, based on its list of notes) to be a fluffy confection of fruity rose with plenty of powder, as pastel-tinted as a dish of Jordan almonds. The pear note is fleeting, but the candy-like raspberry notes runs throughout the fragrance. The rose is lightly jammy, and it rests on a base of vanilla-infused whipped cream. And yes, there's also a strong suggestion of talcum powder in the musk notes. Ballerina No. 1 doesn't last as long on my skin as I expected it to, but it's good, girlish fun while it does last.\nAs you can guess, this is the kind of sweet fruity-floral you'll either love or hate, depending on your personal tastes. I actually didn't care much for the last few Rosine releases (Glam Rose, Vive la Mari\u00e9e), but I found myself oddly charmed by Ballerina No. 1. Then again, I'm a passionate fan of Lipstick Rose and Dr\u00f4le de Rose, right?  I've nearly finished my sample vial, and I wouldn't mind owning a decant. It certainly doesn't feel like a workplace fragrance, but it would be perfect for a birthday party, a springtime walk in the park, teatime with a friend, or similar light-hearted occasions.\nHave you recently tried any new rose fragrances that you enjoyed (or didn't enjoy)? Feel free to share in the comments!\nAcqua di Parma Rosa Nobile is available as 50 ml ($120) and 100 ml ($180) Eau de Parfum, as well as a matching body cream. For purchasing information, see the listing for Acqua di Parma under Perfume Houses.\nLes Parfums de Rosine Ballerina No. 1 is available as 50 ml (\u20ac95) and 100 ml (\u20ac125) Eau de Parfum. For purchasing information, see the listing for Les Parfums de Rosine under Perfume Houses.\nNote: top image is Heritage Rose Garden [cropped, tripled & colorized] via HarshLight at flickr; some rights reserved.\nI\u2019ve heard good things about Vero Kern\u2019s Rozy! I must hunt down a sample.\nI tried the Rosa Nobile the other day and went, \u2018Meh!\u2019 Found it totally uninteresting. It was gone within minutes, anyway. \nMy favourite rose perfumes are Creed Fleur de Th\u00e9 Rose Bulgare (so fresh, so true) and SL La Fille de Berlin (sweet and slightly dirty), which I\u2019ve been wearing since last year and still love.\nI hate the bottle of Ballerina No. 1 as much as I like that of Rosa Nobile.\nBela, that classic Acqua di Parma bottle shape is great, isn\u2019t it?\nI love Creed FdTRB and SL La Fille de Berlin, too!! I miss that Creed\u2026 shame they stopped making it.\nI didn\u2019t know they stopped making FdTRB! I am totally out of it. I would never have bought the big expensive bottle anyway \u2013 why they never made a smaller bottle I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m glad I have a very large decant of it from a few years ago!! I really neglected my rose scents this summer.\nYes, it\u2019s a beautiful bottle and I think it\u2019s especially gorgeous with that delicate pink juice in it.\nI cherish my decant of FdTRB. I hope it won\u2019t ever \u2018turn\u2019.\nI wore Sottile one evening earlier this week. It\u2019s really amazingly well done, kind of a silvery tea rose.\nIsn\u2019t it nice? I\u2019ve liked that one for a while. It seems simple but it\u2019s more than the sum of its parts.\nYes, and it seems like rose soliflores can easily go weird or wrong.\nI\u2019m gagging on Ballerina just for the description. I like some of the other Rosine line, though. The only thing that stops me from buying (Rose D\u2019Ete and Rose Praline, for example) is their short life and boring drydown \u2013 unless you tell me that some of the good ones are different.\nHave you tried Rose de Rosine or Poussiere de Rose? Those both last well on me.\nRose scents usually don\u2019t agree with me, but Friedemodin Ros\u00e9e de Nuit was a nice exception, fullbodied with a few dewdrops, neither sweet nor sour.\nOh! I think I have a sample of that in my \u201cto try\u201d box. Thanks for the reminder!\nI have so many rose fragrances and for a long time rose had such a bad name. So I am glad there has been this modern trend the past few years giving rose it\u2019s due and introducing rose to new sniffers, etc, etc. It\u2019s a good thing that no one has to muffle their response or hang their head to admit they\u2019re wearing a rose anymore. However, I find that hand in hand with this trend has been some rather boring rose scents that cost way too much money for what they are. It\u2019s ok if it\u2019s marketed as \u201crose water\u201d and only costs $35 a bottle, but to put so many \u2018this is not your granny\u2019 or \u2018this is not massive\u2019 rose fragrances out that are so polite and almost apologizing for their busty, voluptuous heritage, is disappointing to me. I really like Delire de Rose and Coup de Foudre, but they are too $$ for their comparitive simplicity to some of my other richly developed whoppers. If a bottle of any of these (aside from perhaps the ballerina) crossed my path, I\u2019d probably adopt it, but I have so many rose bottles already. Nahema and Ce Soir ou Jamais and Ta\u2019if and Sa Majeste la Rose and FdTRB and Velvet Rose are getting ready for Dames vs. Missies smack down, and I know who\u2019s gonna win.\nI agree \u2014 I don\u2019t mind paying a lot for a rose fragrance as long as it\u2019s complex or lush or unusual in some way. If someone really just wants a nice rose soliflore, she could spend much less on Crabtree & Evelyn Rosewater or Sonoma Scent Studio Velvet Rose!\nMany years ago, when Rosine had fewer than half a dozen fragrances, & a stand-alone counter in Selfridges, I managed to blag samples of each one from the SA. Rose tends not to sit well on me but these ones did. Have just looked at the Rosine website & the only one I recognise is \u2018La Rose de\u2026\u2019 \u2013 I do seem to remember one that erred on the green side (always my first choice), perhaps with stem & leaf in there.\nIt looks as though they\u2019ve stopped offering some of the older ones\u2026what a shame. Glad to see La Rose de Rosine there, at least. On me, it\u2019s rose and violet with some stemminess and a chypre base.<|endoftext|>"

For the first time in perfumery, a composition has been conceived as a scented mosquito repellent. Its formulation incorporates essential oils that have been selected for their mosquito-repelling properties, blending the lively, aromatic notes of lemongrass, geranium and lemon eucalyptus with the flowery accents of neroli and orange blossom. Enjoy nature and summer to the fullest while scenting yourself with fresh, floral notes.\nTo celebrate summer, diptyque transports us to the heart of Mediterranean nature. A land of unspoilt beauty, of scents and colors, the Mediterranean has been a constant source of inspiration for the Maison. From the prickly pears clustering along a narrow cove to the lavender and lemongrass on a terrace at sunset, to smell their scents is to be swept away to a far-off place. Escape with diptyque's collection of summer essentials: an eau de toilette, a hair mist, a mosquito repellent, a scented insert and a vinaigre de toilette infused with plants from the Mediterranean basin.\nThe artist Matthieu Coss\u00e9 has decorated each item in the collection. The Maison's iconic oval is enlivened with color, while original illustrations adorn the bottles and candle jars. This is a summer to be experienced with all the senses.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "You might think of a favorites post as a plethora of beauty products, an exorbitant handbag purchase, some chic basics, and a statement piece thrown in for good measure. As a small blogger, I figured I would start with a small selection. Before I get into the goods, I want to give you all a quick overview of August. I turned 25 on the 1st, (woohoo I'm a quarter-century old now!), lost my job in the middle of the month due to position cuts, and now am focusing what I truly love: photography and writing for my blog. I love nothing more than creating content and storytelling for my platform. I'm one of those people that believes everything happens for a reason, so this could've been the push I needed to dive into what I genuinely want to do. I know there are many obstacles ahead, but if I'm doing what I enjoy, I'll be able to overcome them. Alright, let's get into what you all came here for. These are the products that I constantly reached for all month, and have no intention of putting down anytime soon.\ndiptyque huile de parfum pour la douche: The dreamiest shower oil you will ever use. This one is in L'Ombre dans l'Eau, or Baies. The liquid version of the candle we all love.\nNotes: Blackcurrant, Bulgarian rose, Ambergris.\nMy favorite use for this is on the legs, elbows, and to rinse your hands with after you've chopped garlic or onions. You can skip perfume if you use this since it leaves an adequate veil of a scent behind.\nChanel Le Vernis Longwear Nail Lacquer: This red... it's perfect. A blend of a tomato hue with a hint of spice. I'll be wearing it every season. It also really is longwear-- I've had it on a for a week without any chipping. The formula is also 5-free with bioceramics and ceramides to improve the quality of your nails. Win all around.\ndiptyque Cypr\u00e8s: If you want to feel like you're on the Amalfi Coast of Italy sipping limoncello or on the Greek island of Santorini staring out into the deep cerulean (pop quiz: what movie is this color mentioned in?) ocean while relaxing on a lounge chair, you'll want to get this candle. It means Cypress tree, those of which thrive in Mediterranean climates and terrains. I'm almost out, and I can already feel the vacation coming to an end.\nAv\u00e8ne Thermal Spring Water: I'm pretty sure this is one of the products that has kept my acne at bay. A big pro for me on this is the mister. It comes out fine and gentle, because no one likes a sharp gust of water in their face. It keeps me hydrated without feeling oily, and soothes my sensitive skin.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Undoubtedly, one of the most successful fragrances of the last ten years is Paco Rabanne 1 Million. This week we get to know one of the three noses behind this blockbuster, Olivier Pescheux. An International Fragrance Prize (formerly the Prix Fran\u00e7ois Coty) winner in 2010, Pescheux studied perfumery at Versailles\u2019 prestigious ISIPCA.\nHe later worked in Bangkok for Payan Bertrand and in Paris as a perfumer for Annick Goutal. He then moved on to Kao in 1993 and then Givaudan in 1998 where he created fragrances for brands like Montblanc, Yohji Yamamoto, Adidas, and Comme des Garcons. But many fragrance fans will know Pescheux for his contributions to Diptyque, e.g. the L\u2019Eau series.\nPescheux has said, \"\u201cFragrance is a creative idea. To preserve its strength and authenticity, the idea must be translated with precision and definition. The challenge is to find the right balance between creativity and accessibility\u201d (Fragrances.bg).\nPescheux's international experiences have had a profound impact on his palette and he enjoys exploring a broad range of aromatic materials when composing. Fragrances.bg explains, \"Among his favourite scents you will find green mandarin (highly valued by the perfumer for its clean freshness), ambroxan (for its soft sensuality) and patchouli (for the unique texture it adds to the composition). Apart from these natural scents, he also admires a lot of synthetic formulas. His secret, in fact, lies in the combining of natural and synthetic materials, thus he creates new and distinctive olfactory masterpieces that beautifully correspond with his motto: 'Be yourself and be authentic'.\"\nThis week, Fragrantica's international editors celebrate the work of this prolific young perfumer. As always, we invite you to share your own choices with us in a comment below!\nAs far as my preferences for amber go, this fragrance is unbeatable. Voile d'Ambre is a staple in my collection and I am never without one bottle. I have been through at least three. There is nothing groundbrteaking or innovative in this composition. Just good deep amber, so satisfying and golden. The kind of amber that has all the facets you expect from it, perfected and most surpriingly an exceptionally good price.\nVery vanillic in its core, Voile d'Ambre is also woody, warm and the spices used here are dosed with such care that they show their magic powers without making it overwhelming. Everything here is elegant and poised, yet exotic and very sensual. Another plus: the character of this perfume is completely unisex, since it never goes far from what it says in the bottle: good old amber that is able to warm our hearts in the winter, but has enough softness so it can also be used in the summer. For extra results, I layer it with an Arabian oud oil and it becomes expensive, opulent and extravag<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Christmas time, in a large part of the world is a time of the mini ice age, when snow flurries swirl across the sky and treacherous ice threatens road users and pedestrians. It is a time when the skies will go dark by mid-afternoon and the cold chills you to the bone. It\u2019s no wonder then, that candles and warm scents do well at this time of year. Every bit of cheery light counts!\nAnd no one does Christmas candles quite like Diptyque. Every year, I wait to see what Diptyque has dreamed up for their Christmas collection, and I\u2019m rarely disappointed. Ok, perhaps I have been a little disappointed, but that\u2019s more to do with personal preferences.\nI\u2019ll just run down some of the offerings, for those who are keen.\nFirst off of course, are the Diptyque Christmas candles. They come in 3 limited edition scents, in beautiful limited edition metallic jars. There is a theatrical feel about the design, and the full size candle boxes come with an outer sleeve, with a pull open window, giving you a peep at the design. Very well executed.\nEpices et Delices (Red) \u2013 A gingerbread scent captured and distilled from 1.5 tons of freshly baked gingerbread cookies! I was absolutely fascinated by this as it didn\u2019t have a heavy buttery scent, the way cookie-based scents tend to smell. There is that spiciness you associate with gingerbread coming through in a most intriguing manner.\nLe Roi Sapin (Green) \u2013 This is your classic Christmas scent of pine.  That\u2019s what I did anyway. I was told that this year\u2019s Sapin scent is that of a Balsamic Fir, so it has been slightly tweaked from previous years\u2019 offerings.\nThe mini candles are sold separately or in a coffret set. The thing with Diptyque\u2019s mini candles, I\u2019ve found, is that they are really meant for small enclosed rooms, unless you burn a few of them together. In a larger area, you\u2019re basically just wasting money, so don\u2019t do that.\nI bought this one year when it wasn\u2019t carried locally, and I have to say that while I\u2019m not crazy about it due to the fact that I made the mistake of burning them in my living hall (too wide a space for the scent to cover so it dissipated too quickly). In a smaller, enclosed, or better yet, air-conditioned room, it smells much stronger and scents the air better.\nI\u2019m quite interested in this one, personally speaking. What you get in a box, are 5 spray minis of 7.5ml Diptyque scents.\nLike the Jo Malone set I showed you a few days ago, this one from Diptyque similarly allows you to sample 5 of Diptyques iconic scents, to work out what works for you, or what doesn\u2019t.  They aren\u2019t your usual pretty perfumes, so they can take some getting used to. A sampler pack is a nice way to be introduced to a brand, and I like that it comes in a spray!\nThere are a couple more items in store you can check out, but these were the ones that really caught my attention.\nWill you check out the Diptyque Christmas offerings?\nNEXT POST: The Dr. Brandt Power Dose Vitamin C might be small but it sure is mighty good stuff!\nThe holiday candles are so pretty that I\u2019d feel obligated to give them<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " for my batch as well, it was amazing, just a few drops needed (as recommended here in one article about scented bath).\nI never tried the vintage, the current one is a smooth green scent I really love for a walk-in-an-enchanted-forest mood.\nJoy: Reading an article yesterday about EL\u2019s original Azuree brought back memories of that amazing fragrance. The modern replacement is not even a shadow of the original. Does anyone know of a fragrance that has the depth of leather, tobacco, and a herbaceous notes that can compare? I see the vintage for sale on Ebay, but I am leary of buying there.\nI did buy a bottle of the reformulated Aliage last year. What a disappointment!\nJoy: This sounds like a great suggestion. Thank you!\nI ordered a decant of Azuree to verify that I still like it, and I do. It lasted all day.\nMichael: I have a question for anyone who owns a bottle (or more) of Chanel No 22, vintage or otherwise. I read in a review that the current formulation excludes both the tuberose and incense components, compared to its vintage formula. Is that true? And if so, does it make the current version sweeter and less spicy in the drydown?\nNina Z: I love spicy fragrances! Noir Epices by Frederic Malle is a very spicy and rather dry oriental, using orange instead of vanilla. I also like Eau Lente by Diptyque, which has both oppoponax (myrrh) and tons of spices. Of course the classic oriental with spices is vintage Opium (still not that hard to find) and I love Dawn Spencer Hurwitz\u2019s take on it DSH Fou d\u2019Opium.\nThe Perfume Baby: I have fallen in love with Guerlain Mon Pr\u00e9cieux Nectar Extrait which sadly, is hard to find and is very costly. I would love to find its doppelganger.\nAnother one I love is A Lab on Fire Sweet Dreams 2003. It\u2019s an eau de cologne, and I burned through 4 bottles last summer. It lasts maybe 2 hours on me. I sampled a ton load of EDCs in an attempt to find something approximating it, with no success.\nI have learned so much from so many of you, and am looking forward to your opinions.\nKaren A: Arpege was all I wore for a while, so I can relate! My suggestion is to just start trying whatever you can, either from the reviews here on BdJ or by exploring a particular note, such as rose, jasmine, etc. Luckyscent has samples at good prices ans Surrender to Chance and the Perfumed Court also sell decants of all sizes.\nAnother option is to explore a particular perfumer. You can look up by creator on Fragrantica. It\u2019s a fun way to discover the \u201cfeel\u201d or style of different artists. Or, you can also explore a line \u2013 whether it\u2019s a large company or an indie.\nIf you are near a good department store such as Saks, Nordstroms, or Neiman\u2019s (those are the ones I\u2019m familiar with other regions have others), go in and talk with a SA from a line, such as Guerlain, Chanel, Tom Ford and let them know you really enjoy perfumes and want to find some new fragrances.\nMany times you can get some samples to try out, just be sure if you find one that works to go back and support the SA who helped you.\ngiven what you wear, I think you 24 Faubourg would suit you best (from the Hermes range). However, something lovely but a little different would be their new perfume, Gallop. Rose and leather in a gorgeous bottle that looks like a stirrup. Or maybe Ambre Narguile would be worth a try.\nNina Z: Most of the Hermes fragrances are very different in style than Arpege and Joy, which are both rich and complex. The more recent Hermes fragrances are \u201cminimalist\u201d by design and so are more sparkling but also a bit thin and simplistic (sorry, I\u2019m not a fan). You might like them, however, so if you have the chance, smell away! Smell everything! Since you liked the Annick Goutal citrus (yes, it has changed!), check out Pamplemousse Rose and Eau d`Orange Verte.\nMarilyn stanonis: Dear Hamamelis, Marilyn here \u2013 how very good to hear from you and to receive your excellent advice! I cannot wait to try your suggestions, especially Heure Exquise. It will be awhile before I can get to a perfume counter, maybe not till September, but I\u2019m going to learn how to obtain samples! I\u2019ll be sure to let you know.\nFor some time now I\u2019ve been fascinated by your name. Some years ago I had a Witch Hazel tree in my yard \u2014 the one with yellow blossoms. It bloomed every January and I always looked forward to it \u2014 January is pretty dreary in the US Midwest. Nowadays I spritz witch hazel on my face every morning to help me wake up, and I often think of you.\nAnn: I am new here, and I have not smelled a ton of perfume yet, but I would like to find a perfume that I \u2764\ufe0f, and that is long lasting w/ moderate to strong silage.\nI love greens, herbaceous, and earthy scents. I also love roses and white florals. And spices. And citrus. But since it\u2019s summer, I\u2019d like to splurge on a great green fragrance that I can drench myself in.\nI like Chanel number 19, but not Cristalle as much.\nkpaint: I felt the same \u2013 on paper it looked like a perfect match for me. It took a few years of occasional sniffing to come around to it. Now it\u2019s a big huge lovefest with me.\nHamamelis: Annick Goutal\u2019s Heure Exquise, or Ninfeo Mio, or Eau du Sud (which is a lot like Eau Dynamisante but much longer lasting).\nHoly fast shipping from SSS!\nKatya: I got my MH Fleurs de Sel off ebay for a pretty decent price, too. I wasn\u2019t sure about it at first but I have since fallen in love with it.\nKharina: Good morning from the UK!\nLast week, whilst melting in front of my air purifier and fan in the diabolical heat, I thought I was happy I purchased a bottle of old skool 4711 to liberally bathe myself in. I do enjoy the cooling freshness. The sad thing of course is that it is a simple cologne and it is not at all long lasting. Any suggestions of a bergamot scent even for men that could out last the heat? Also, any recommendations to something that smells similar to Santa Maria Novella\u2019s Melograno?\nNina Z: Well, no citrus notes are going to be that long lasting because the nature of citrus is that it\u2019s a more fleeting note. However, if you like bergamot, check out Bergamote by The Different Company\u2013that will last a lot longer than 4711! Another idea would be Dior\u2019s classic refreshing fragrance Eau Sauvage, which while not bergamot, is going to last much longer than the 4711.\nThis will probably sound silly but do you think maybe Lush might have something up your street? When you say bergamot (or any citrus) Sun perfume comes to mind which I remember smelling lovely but which in the end didn\u2019t warrant a full bottle. Still, Lush scents are known to be tenacious \u2013 so tenacious, in fact, I had to get rid of my Vanillary because I was sick of it.\naurora: Hello Kharina: waving back from the UK too, it was so hot last Wednesday wasn\u2019t it.\nKharina: So hot I got an undercut and now it\u2019s gone all cool, hah! Love your idea about the Shalimar cologne, I haven\u2019t had a chance to test the cologne version. A dear friend of mine wears Shalimar all year, but as the cologne is more fresh and citrus, I\u2019ll give that a go.\npenny: You are so welcome! so happy to help, I would like to add if you don\u2019t mind, that Dior\u2019s Escale \u00e0 Portofino is very similar a real favourite of mine but only lasts a bit longer than 4711 however Tom Fords Portofino lasts more anyway hope you find one that fits the bill.\nMara: Hello to everybody from Athens, Greece!\nI have recently discovered \u201cEl Born\u201d, a liquorish eau de parfum by CARNER, a maison de perfumers from Barcelona. \u201cEl Born\u201d belongs to their Woody Collection, and is inspired by the homonymous historical district and neighborhood of the Catalan capital.\nIts Top Notes are sicilian lemon, calabrian bergamot, angelica and honey. Middle Notes are fig, heliotrope, benzoin from Laos, egyptian jasmine. Its Base Notes are madagascaran vanilla, Peru balsam, australian sandalwood and musk.\nCornelia Bl<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Posted on April 22, 2019 by mark behnke\tin Mark Behnke, New Perfume Reviews and tagged diptyque eau de minthe, fabrice pellegrin, reviews.\nAs a child one of the few alcoholic things I begged for from my parents was Cr\u00e8me de Menthe. I would ask to have a drizzle on my ice cream or to sip a small amount over crushed ice. I craved the coolness of the mint over cold things. To eat, or as part of a cocktail, I still enjoy mint. I even drizzle some Cr\u00e8me de Menthe on my Ben & Jerry\u2019s. (Pro Tip: put it on Chocolate Fudge Brownie) I don\u2019t know why it is such a problematic ingredient in perfume for me. It is one of those ingredients which needs to find the right concentration. Alternatively it can be part of an interesting effect which was what I found in Diptyque Eau de Minthe.\nAs soon as I saw the name, I recoiled a bit. This was going to be a perfume which featured mint as a keynote. I expected not to enjoy what perfumer Fabrice Pellegrin had put in the bottle. The press release mentions the name comes from Greek mythology. Minthe was a water nymph who was having an affair with Hades; until Persephone found out. As is the norm in these tales poor Minthe was turned in to the herb mint. When I read that I\u2019m thinking some classic type of perfume. Which shows why press releases are not predictors of the perfume they promote. Eau de Minthe was much more sci-fi than mythology.\nOne of the tends in perfumery is to try and smell \u201cnatural\u201d. I put that word in quotes because it is also mainly PR speak. I understand what it means. What it translates to are perfumes which do not embrace the overtly synthetic. Eau de Minthe chooses an un- \u201cnatural\u201d approach.\nThe boogeyman I was worried about most wallops me right out of the sprayer; mint. This is the mint scent of every antiseptic you\u2019ve ever smelled. It is the kind of mint which usually has me looking for a cosmetic wipe. Except M. Pellegrin embraced those hard aspects and encased them in a synthetic heart of rose oxide and geraniol. He turns the mint from mouthwash to something subtly metallic and even more stridently green. I liked it. This was the mint of the android coolly calculating possibilities. The final ingredient is a patchouli fraction which also fits in to the whole synthetic vibe. An engineered version of a common perfume ingredient.\nEau de Minthe has 12-14 hour longevity and average sillage.\nPosted on April 21, 2019 by mark behnke\tin Mark Behnke, The Sunday Magazine and tagged friendship, leftside1.\nI am not an atheist despite being a scientist. I will always take facts over the fantastic, yet I also believe there is a spiritual component to my life. I was taken through the Catholic Church all the way to Confirmation. The scientific mind driving the older priest crazy while the younger one, Father Leonardi, seemed amused. He took me serious enough to answer instead of bluster. The part of me which is still Catholic, is because of him. I am happy to commune with the higher spirit in my own way while respecting all who choose a different path.\nI was reminded this week as Passover and Easter fall on the same weekend that my horizons were broadened in high school because of my friends I call my \u201cfamily by choice\u201d. The one I was most temperamentally like was Rich. We could bounce off each other until our friends would yell at us to \u201cShut Up!\u201d. Which would achieve the desired effect while we cackled. Fifty years later we still try our loved one\u2019s patience.\nI spent a lot of time at my friend\u2019s homes. Rich\u2019s parents were the ones most likely to engage us in conversation. One of the key conversations I had in my life on bigotry was Rich\u2019s dad showing me the pamphlets which were passed around about Jews by white supremacy organizations. It was eye-opening on how easy it was to demonize another race. It is one of the earliest conversations I remember having with an adult on a serious subject. I can say the foundation of my beliefs on that subject were formed that day.\nI don\u2019t remember when exactly that conversation took place but upon the next Passover, I was invited to the family Seder. It was a chance to see something more of the Jewish faith other than the Bar Mitzvahs I had been to. Rich\u2019s dad and grandfather took us through all the ceremony explaining everything to me. It was something I soaked up greedily. Along with the food. I am not a good singer and while part of a Passover Seder is singing songs, I kept my voice down. Until we sang Chad Gadya. It was the last song of the night and I decided to give it my all pitching my voice low for the three syllables in the title.\nI\u2019ve been to both of Rich\u2019s children\u2019s Mitzvahs. I mentioned my enjoyment of that earlier conversation with Rich\u2019s dad. As a teenager I didn\u2019t have the perspective to know how important it was. It was nice for me to let him know how his words shaped the adult I became.\nI\u2019ve also been thinking a lot about where I do place my faith. One of those places is in the friendship of my family and friends. It may not be a church, but it is where I feel the spirit the most.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Hey y\u2019all! Who else is a beauty junkie like me?!? I am so excited to be sharing some current favorites and new Summer essentials with you guys. It\u2019s all from Nordstrom of course. I love that I can get skincare, beauty, haircare and home all in one spot. They are a one stop shop for me when it comes to all things beauty, fashion and home.\nCheck out below for all my Summer beauty essentials you need to try now!\nI had to start with this one, cause it seriously is so AMAZING y\u2019all. I\u2019ve been a Chanel Coco Mademoiselle signature scent girl for a very long time, but this one came in and surprised me. If you are looking for an every day scent but something still very memorable, check this one out. You will love it!\nI\u2019ve been looking for a grab and go palette for that must have Summer glow and this one is it. It has blush, bronzer and highlighter all in one compact. It comes in two shade option, I went for \u201clightgasm\u201d and the colors are perfect. Oh and it comes with a mirror making it perfect for travel or in your handbag.\nI fell in love with the glowgasm palette so I had to try the cream highlighter. It\u2019s perfect for those no makeup days but you want to add a little glow or when you want to go full glam. The formula is creamy and buildable, it\u2019s a must have for that Summer glow.\nI\u2019ve been wanting to try this lip serum for a while. I will admit, I don\u2019t see a difference as far as the volumizing, but the formula is so nice. It\u2019s thick but not sticky and very hydrating. I also love the applicator.\nIn the hot Summer months I prefer a tinted moisturizer to foundation so I decided to order this one. You can wear this alone as your foundation or layered under your foundation as your sunscreen. Yes, it\u2019s a splurge, but I am a huge La Mer fan, so I had to give it a try. It\u2019s lightweight but surprisingly covers nicely. Plus, you get the benefits of the La Mer broth, it\u2019s a win win.\nSpeaking of splurge, this is a MAJOR splurge, I know\u2026.but it\u2019s so good. I purchased the La Mer The Body cream in a jar with no expectations and I fell in love. I recently ordered the La Mer The Body cream in a tube and I LOVE IT just as much. I\u2019ve had dry skin my whole life and this cream has done wonders. It\u2019s a splurge but so worth it.\nWe focus so much on skincare for the face, we often neglect the skin on our neck and chest. I am guilty of this as well, so I wanted to try this 45 day treatment out. I will have to keep you all posted on the results after the 45 days are up, but so far so good!\nI am a MAJOR candle lover in the Fall and Winter but am always on the hunt for candles to burn in Spring and Summer. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, you can burn any candle year round but sometimes you want something a little lighter for those Spring and Summer months and Diptyque Baies is perfect. It\u2019s fruity, fresh and clean. Y\u2019all have been recommending this one to me for a long time, so I am finally glad I ordered it. Another favorite is Jo Malone Honeysuckle and Davana. I love the perfume, so it\u2019s no surprise I love the candle as well.\nThank you to Nordstrom for sponsoring today\u2019s summer beauty essentials blog post. All products were selected by me and all thoughts are my own.\nYour pictures are so beautifully detailed.\nI\u2019ve smelled some of the Jo Malone not sure if I\u2019ve smelled this one. I\u2019ll have to remember to check it out.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "When Thierry Mugler launched Angel in 1992, the perfume set the standard for the modern gourmand fragrance family. Angel\u2019s overdose of ethyl maltol, a synthetic sugar note, was entirely novel for the time, and the scent has inspired countless flankers. Decades later, it remains a blockbuster \u2013 but what was once a daring aroma has been filtered down into countless knockoffs so as to make its fruity-cotton-candy-chocolate-explosion feel staid.\nThe gourmand category has grown significantly since the Angel days; thirty years later, new technologies and evolving tastes are opening up our concept of edible perfumes. But the new gourmands are not your usual vanilla smells: these are frequently savory, vegetal aromas rather than sweet and fruity.\n\u201cFruit can be perceived as young, and vegetables as very adult. So having a vegetable fragrance, it\u2019s kind of like an adult gourmand,\u201d says David Moltz, co-founder of Brooklyn-based perfume brand D.S. & Durga. Earlier this spring, D.S. & Durga launched Bistro Waters, with notes of lime blossom, pear, basil, and green pepper, which tips it from a simple fresh green scent into a savory concoction. Shortly after, L\u2019Artisan Parfumeur launched Le Potager, a five-scent collection of perfumes centered around vegetable notes, including cauliflower, beet, leek, sweet pea, and tomato leaf.\nVegetal smells began creeping on the market in recent years thanks in part to COMME des GAR\u00c7ONS, which launched Radish Vetiver as part of its Clash series in 2019, followed by 2020\u2019s Rouge, a spicy fragrance that is beet red in both color and aroma.

        "passage": "Why Is Cologne So Freaking Expensive?\nAhh, cologne \u2014 those alluring natural and synthesized oils in a stylishly designed bottle that\u2019ll make you smell like your favorite celebrity. Sure, colognes have complex scents created at considerable cost by professionals (known as perfumers). But why does three ounces of the stuff cost $100? Is the chance to literally smell like your favorite brand really that intoxicating?\nIt sure is! But there\u2019s also a lot more to it, because the world of fragrance is complex. Alongside Chandler Burr, author, former scent critic for The New York Times and a fragrance expert par excellence, we dabbed on some answers!\nAll right then: Why is cologne expensive?\n\nNoted. But why is it so expensive?\nBecause every single luxury brand owes its existence to its perfume, Burr says. Sure, fashion houses make clothing, which they\u2019re known for. But what they sell the most of are bags and fragrance \u2014 they make tons and tons of it. Numbers are impossible to come by, even for public companies, because fragrance revenue often falls under a brand\u2019s larger umbrella of \u201cbeauty\u201d (meaning makeup, skincare and perfume). But Burr says it\u2019s often the lion\u2019s share of a fashion house\u2019s revenue.\nSo what are the profit margins like?\nWhat am I actually paying for, then?\nCompanies are just putting their name on scents and coasting on it?\nChanel, Hermes and Prada, as well as Frederic Malle, Byredo and Diptyque are six brands, Burr says, that put a ton of money into the juice. For example, if you buy a product from them, you\u2019re buying a fragrance in which the rose they use is a really high-quality rose, and the citrus will come from Sicily or Calabria (or possibly Florida, which produces high-quality citrus oils for the perfume industry).\nNatural ingredients are more expensive, then?\nActually, no. There are cheap natural ingredients and expensive natural ingredients. Likewise, there are cheap and expensive synthetic ingredients as well. It\u2019s a misconception that all synthetics are cheap and all natural ingredients are expensive.\nBut expensive ingredients are better? Is that it?\nHe compares the skill of a perfumer to that of a pastry chef: A great pastry chef can take basic ingredients like flour, water, eggs, sugar, salt and decent chocolate and make something incredible out of it.\nSo what makes a fragrance good?\nBurr has several criteria he uses for scent. Is it well built, does it hang together and does it perform? In other words, does it all come off the skin together? Because you can\u2019t have one giant raw material (maybe a floral like geranium, or a wood) jumping out that overpowers everything else \u2014 that indicates that it\u2019s not well made.\nOne thing that bad scents do is what\u2019s called \u201cfront-loading the money.\u201d That\u2019s when you apply it and it\u2019s great for 10 minutes (in which time you\u2019ve decided on it at the counter, have paid for it and are walking out of the store with it), then it quickly falls apart and smells different. The reason this happens is because of the different molecular weights of the ingredients: light ones fall off before the heavy ones. A good perfumer knows how to make a scent hold together; a hack one will front-load the money.\nYeah \u2014 all that advertising and all those endorsements cost a fortune. But it all pencils out! Burr compares it to making a $200 million blockbuster movie. You pay, say, $10 million for your star, then many millions total for all that other stuff: the screenplay, all the crew, the director, the cinematographer, that helicopter shot over Prague, whatever. And then an additional 50 percent for the marketing. It might be a blockbuster for a few months \u2014 perhaps doubling its budget \u2014 then, for the most part, its chance to earn huge money is mostly over as it gets licensed to Netflix or whatever for the next decade.\nFor the big fashion houses, they pay scent houses to develop the formula, they pay Cate Blanchett $8 million to $10 million to endorse it, then they spend $10 million to $20 million on the marketing. You\u2019re up to $50 million to start with, but here\u2019s the thing, according to Burr: Armani Si makes something like a half-billion dollars a year \u2014 year after year after year! Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue makes a billion a year! The best-selling scent in the world is Acqua di Gio, and while L\u2019Oreal won\u2019t share the exact figures, so nobody knows for sure, global sales are estimated at $1 billion to $2 billion a year for a product created back in 1995, so there\u2019s very little advertising these days. It\u2019s in a sort of perpetual motion at this point.\nAlso bear in mind that a successful scent had all the development done on it years ago, and they buy millions of glass bottles at a time, so the per-unit cost of packaging is near zero.\nFragrance is essential for a top brand, huh?\nYes. A successful scent absolutely rakes in the money for fashion houses that tend to be most well known for making clothes that, in reality, almost no one can actually afford. But don\u2019t lose sight of the product itself: Like any luxury good, it\u2019s crafted by experts, and there\u2019s a true quality to it.\nSo there\u2019s a lot riding on a brand\u2019s fragrance, and for all the money it\u2019ll cost you, you can at least be confident that a popular or classic scent is high-quality stuff.<|endoftext|>"

Uggghhh, this just keeps expanding and growing and I feel there is no turning back.\nFrom Fragrantica: L\u2019Ombre Dans L\u2019Eau (\u201cShadow in the water\u201d) is a female fragrance from 1983, based on the unusual and beautiful harmony of black currant leaf and Bulgarian rose, which blend perfectly together.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: L\u2019Ombre dans l\u2019Eau is a total scrubber to me that others seem to like. I don\u2019t get it. To me, L\u2019Ombre dans l\u2019Eau smells so artificial as if its made from a chemistry set. Adding that artificiality to a whopping projection makes my head feel like I\u2019m being struck with a rose sledgehammer! I see this better suited for a home fragrance than a personal fragrance, but even as a scented candle, this would make me want to leave the room. I\u2019m not really familiar with the Diptyque line, but this does not make me want to explore any more.\nCategories: Diptyque | Tags: 1 bone, Diptyque, EDT, fragrance, L'Ombre dans l'Eau, review | Permalink.\nThank you for not adding to my list of things I need to try. Sorry you had to experience that.\nPoodle, not a good experience at all. Please stay away!\nScrubbed hard Mr. River. Unfortunately, the scent is still stuck in my nose!\nSounds terrible, but then, the notes don\u2019t appeal me to me to begin with. Given the artificiality you describe and its projection (not to mention the price), I\u2019d bet it\u2019s loaded up with synthetics. Oddly enough, I skimmed L\u2019Ombre d\u2019Eau\u2019s entry in the Luca Turin/Tania Sanchez book this morning. Went back to quote a bit for you. She references a \u201cvegetal top note\u201d and an \u201chigh-pitched blast\u201d and says that it ends up \u201csweet-and-savory\u201d in a way that smells \u201cat certain distances plasticky, like a vinyl table-cloth.\u201d She calls it \u201cblunt\u201d for all-day wear and says she enjoyed it as a shower gel.\nIn short, yes, clearly synthetic up the wazoo. I have nothing but disdain for fragrances like that, no matter how much others may clamor over them.\nBTW, that photo is even more horrific than your description of the fragrance. There is something deeply terrifying about beauty pageant kids or, to be precise, the parents who make the poor things look like that. \nJust out of interest, any idea if you tried the recent reformulated version or the original.\nI have a feeling that you might not have liked either, but what you\u2019re describing certainly sounds more like the current inferior iteration.\nI\u2019m interested that so few readers seem to know the Diptyque line, is it something of an oddity in the US? One can\u2019t move for it over here.\nI\u2019m sure this was the reformulation. I got this as a sample when I purchased something else\u2026probably about a year ago as it\u2019s been hidden in the mess of unopened samples that I have. As for the Diptyque line, what you see over here is more of the home fragrance line, specifically candles. I don\u2019t actually recall seeing any of the personal fragrances in the stores.\nOh, you made me giggle with this child pegeant! I get another challenge here, Mr Hound! This Shadow is neither a scrubber, nor a love for me, but I found it quite intriguing how it turned like tomatoe leaves on me and a rose dipped in a metal lake \u2013 quite refreshing, indeed. But odd. Really odd and unwearable to me.\nHowever, it is an exception for me from the whole line of Diptyque I had the chance to sample, wear and adore. I love Phylosikos, Oyedo, Eau Lente, Tam Dao, Do Son, L\u2019Eau de Tarocco, Olene, but I am pretty into 34 boulevard Saint Germain and last year\u2019s Volutes. Do give it a try for each one of them \u2013 it\u2019s like Jo Malone\u2019s \u2013 one fragrance doesn\u2019t speak for the whole line.\nThis sounds like a total disaster of a scent! I\u2019ve been meaning to try this scent for the longest time via samples and decants, but somehow this scent, L\u2019Ombre dans l\u2019Eau, always gets bumped from the list. Hmmm\u2026.I wonder is there a higher power involved in this fragrance disappearing from my order to prevent my nose from being assaulted with the likes of this terrible aroma? That\u2019s a good possibility! Thank you! Now I know I don\u2019t think I will try this one. It sounds disastrous and will probably make me nauseous to even smell such a thing.\nA lot of folks really like this fragrance\u2026but unless you like artificial rose and plastic green, this is not for you. There are so many lovely fragrances out there\u2026 don\u2019t worry about this one! I can\u2019t speak of the other Diptyques though\u2026 although they do make nice home fragrance candles.\nActually Freddie \u2013 it is very similar ot Damascena. But it\u2019s Damascena on steroids. It\u2019s so overpowering that it makes Damascena look pale in comparison\u2026but overall the same composition.\nI like your visual aid (and agree completely with you and Kafka on the topic of children in beauty pageants). It\u2019s interesting that you\u2019ve got that association because when I tested this perfume it strongly reminded me of YSL\u2019s Baby Doll.\nI can\u2019t say that Diptyque is my favorite brand but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to judge it by one perfume. 34 Boulevard Saint Germain and Volutes are very interesting; Tam Dao and Philosykos are definitely worth trying.\nWhat a mess! It is tremendous what reformulations, I liked that perfume has a currant leaf opening very real, very green and then a rose that is emerging, the EDT was powerful as EDP, actually received compliments when I wore and had her sexy point.. no plastic was a gardener!\nBut they are doing! Yesterday I smelled the new version of Olene, yuck, you can not charge for something \u201cnatural\u201d and sell synthetic.. Shame!!\nI would love to be able to compare the old and the new\u2026 several say they love it, maybe they\u2019re smelling the original formula!\nActually, I adore this scent FOR the fact of what it is. I work with synthetic and mineral oils, diesel and tons of grease. I am used to the over bearing smell of hard hitting automotive liquids. This is one of the few I can wear to work and have it lift above all else for a full day. It\u2019s qualities provide a juxtaposition to all the other environmental smells. We have a cake manufacturer next door (less than 50m away) and the smells from there make L\u2019Ombre pale in comparison. I am all for L\u2019Ombre.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "i got cartier roadster sport and z zegna milan for crimbus. the cartier smells like a designer, a high end designer. it's so great, it's like bryan ferry's slave to love, it's elegant and so pop at the same time. it's smooth, it's green, it's glossy, it's like glass. the green smells like mint but it's rosemary. the zegna i didn't know how it smelled but it's got a fig note so i wanted it. there's a prominent low-end designer mall accord initially, like a knockoff impression of aventus or encre noire, a burnt, synthetic smokiness that i assume signifies sexinessitude. but after that there's a dense figginess and some clary sage greenfullness, so it's all good. mall accord or not, it's pretty ok. by mall accord i mean what that sounds like it means. i have diptyque philosykos, which is fig but smells like fig wood, and ferragamo homme, which is fig leaf, and i had a hermes jardin au mediterranee sample or whatever which is also fig leaf. i had a l'artisan caligna sample which i think had the best fig fruit note to it. fuck it, i'll get all the figs.\ni got my brother the roma, so now i can wear it. also lalique lion, which is straight class, and the armaf clone of creed imperial mellesime, which is supposedly really close to the creed. fuck creed prices, i say, unless you have the cash, then just get the creed. it's just money.\nI hadn\u2019t said so in here I think but I bought a bottle of Caldey Island lavender on the basis of its five star review in Perfumes the Guide and it being, idk, made by monks? Anyway it arrived a few weeks back and I really like it. Have always associated lavender with sleep/somnolence, but this is a sweet and summery thing. It lifts the mood and isn\u2019t remotely soporific, quite the opposite. It\u2019s a nice perfume for summer, sure, but worn in the dead grey of winter, it\u2019s something harvested in brighter days bearing the promise that the sun and better days will return. Or something. It\u2019s very good.<|endoftext|>"

Which is why to avoid any sartorial faux pas \u2013 or worse, blisters, we\u2019re sharing with you our packing tips so you can streamline the contents of your suitcase and limit yourself to a selection of versatile pieces.\nNot being able to take liquids on a plane has made us think long and hard about what is and what is not a luxury when it comes to beauty products.\nOur answer to the dreaded 100ml rule? Give solid toiletries a go. Not only do these solid toiletries not count toward the liquids limit, they also can\u2019t open up and run all over your other toiletries. Head to Lush to pick up solid shampoos, conditioners and toothpaste. For perfumes, check out Diptyque\u2019s range of premium solids.\nIf your flying short haul, It\u2019s good to keep hand luggage to an absolute minimum and a small cross-body bag is ideal for day trips and market strolls once you\u2019re at your destination.\nPetite arm-candy will also allow you to avoid the inevitable shoulder ache that ensues when you lug your whole life around all day.

        "passage": " Suede, Indian Wood, Petit Grain, Pink Pepper and Dust. Each perfume, in its hand-blown bottle by Michael Ruh, is typically appealing and wearable, but our personal favourites are Petit Grain and Dust. The first centres on orange, known as \u2018the pig of perfumery\u2019 because every part of the tree yields fragrant oils, and is a very more-ish cologne. Dust is quieter but quirkier, using iris to conjure up the haze of a summer\u2019s day, over a gentle, resinous base.\nBorn in southern Germany but based in Greenwich Village, Ulrich Lang launched his eponymous fragrance brand in 2003, and has since produced seven perfumes inspired by contemporary photography. His latest, 17 Nandan Road, is named after a park in Shanghai that\u2019s noted for its osmanthus trees, whose orange flowers inspired both the perfume\u2019s scent and the colour of the box it comes in (which also features a photograph by Chinese poet Song Yuan). 17 Nandan Road centres on the plush, peachy-apricot smell of Osmanthus fragrans, but adds citrusy top-notes and extends its depth with wood and leather. Delicious.\nTextile design has always held a special place in Diptyque\u2019s heart, especially since the fragrance house\u2019s history is rooted in fabric and wallpaper design before venturing into scents. This backdrop makes its latest collaboration even more poignant. Working with a selection of designs and patterns from storied French fabrics company Pierre Frey, Diptyque has assembled six coffrets of candles containing a pair of complementary scents. Evoking worlds as far reaching as the inside of an artist\u2019s pouch (leather and violet), an Indian flower market (coriander and jasmine) and Laos (benzoin and oud), each coffret is covered in an equally eclectic pairing of prints to bring each olfactory world to life.\nOn 1 April, Aesop is set to launch its latest magic bottle, the Gentle Facial Cleansing Milk. This non-foaming cleanser is a creamy mixture developed to smoothly remove makeup and any impurities from the skin. The first of its kind from the trusted Australian skincare brand, it\u2019s suitable for all skin types thanks to its (Aesop-typical) gentle nature. Being a water based solution, the formula is created to clean without \u2018drying, stripping or perturbing\u2019 the face, providing clear results, and fresh-looking skin. It contains natural based ingredients such as the oils of sandalwood and lavender stem \u2013 known for their soothing qualities, while grape seed breaks down the oil-based components found in make-up, and Panthenol (Provitamin B5) moisturises. We hope it\u2019s not an April fool.\nIn just over ten years, the fashion designer Jason Wu has played a pivotal role in shaping the landscape of American womenswear. His signature mix of tailoring and unabashed femininity has most recently come to life in the form of a new fragrance, Velvet Rouge, which launched during New York Fashion Week. Bottled in a statuesque flacon designed by the architect Andre Mellone that features a thick smoky glass body topped with a golden circular cap, the fragrance is a seductive blend of crushed violet leaves, pepper, magnolia, rose and incense. Created by perfumer Frank Voelkl, the fragrance succinctly distils the duality of Wu\u2019s design ethos.\nThese versatile powder soaps are a new addition to Acqua di Parma\u2019s Colonia range. The Powder Soaps come in three fragrances; Colonia Pura, Colonia Essenza and Colonia. Upon contact with water, the soap forms into a rich silky lather that lightly cleanses and rinses away easily. It will leave your skin feeling smooth and refreshed, the soap aroma subtly lingering on. Presented in a metal container reminiscent of Acqua\u2019s talcum jars of the past, the soap packaging is available in three versions depending on your favourite scent\u2013 white for the citrusy flavoured Colonia, black for the \u2018sophisticated and vibrant\u2019 Essenza and a silver label for the \u2018modern\u2019 Colonia Pura.\nSkincare brand African Botanics launched in 2013 when ex-South African couple Craig and Julia Noik looked to pay homage to the country\u2019s rich cultural heritage and biodiversity. Since, the eco-pioneer has harnessed the powerful properties of indigenous plants across some of South Africa\u2019s most remote locations, all-the-while meeting important sustainability targets. Its latest innovative iteration, Infusion, is a liquid-light micro-serum boosting hydration and supercharging the skin. Filled with pure and sustainably sourced ingredients, including micro-algae, seaweed and anti-pollution oceanic cell shields, this cocktail of age defying botanicals is the skin\u2019s ultimate antidote to the stresses of modern city living.\nThe story behind Brooklyn-based brand Monder began earlier this year when founders Mitch Moondae and Benjy Baptiste set out to reimagine the relationship between fashion and interior design. Their first collection, ANIMA, features a singular colour palette limited to shades of grey and comprises of five key offerings, including two cushions; a pearl suede and brushed wool blanket; a unisex robe, and an alpaca quilt (pictured), which also doubles as a fine art wall hanging. With a focus on growing responsibly, the duo produces all goods in New York with the help of ethical makers who utilise sustainable materials and techniques. As the fashion and design industries are becoming increasingly fast-paced, Monder provides a more conscious alternative for those who favour longevity over trends.\nThe utilitarian accessory brand MZ Wallace is no stranger to collaboration. For their latest undertaking, the Manhattan-based label has teamed up with fellow New Yorkers tenoverten to create the perfect self-care offering that you can take with you always. The stylish nailcare purveyor has filled one of MZ Wallace\u2019s signature quilted cosmetic pouches with its own line of non-toxic essentials, including its natural rose cuticle oil, its rose polish remover cloths, a cuticle filing stone and bottles of its nail strengthening base and quick dry top coat to boot. The limited edition pouch comes in a custom-designed nude pink shade and also boasts extra room to contain one\u2019s other personal favourites.\nGeneva-based specialists in candles and ambient fragrances Mizensir has collaborated with fellow Genevan writing instrument manufacturer Caran d\u2019Ache, on a new edition of pencils, made from fine woods, and scented with Mizensir founder Alberto Marillas\u2019 M\u00e9moire d\u2019Ecolier fragrance. The woody notes naturally produced by freshly sharpened pencils combines with the sweet candy scent of Marillas\u2019 creation, evoking an atmospheric, back-to-school aroma. The collaboration is an example of Caran d\u2019Ache\u2019s commitment to using noble materials in its pencils; here elicited by the use of ayous and linden woods, which are renowned for their solid yet light qualities.\nBarcelona\u2019s long in the tooth design firm Francesc Rife Studio has leant its hand to a chic new dental clinic in Valencia. Seeking to \u2018balance the seriousness of dentistry with the intimacy of design\u2019, a glass box housing the management, communication and planning offices seems to levitate above the resin floor. Treatment rooms and waiting areas are separated by textured glass, defined by its micro-perforated black coating, offering privacy while giving the interiors a sense of openness and light \u2013 not to mention adding a sheen of glamour to your veneer-fitting.\nThe fashion accessories maverick Anya Hindmarch continues her venture into the world of scent with a trio of new fragrance diffusers. This time employing her whimsical signature stamp with scented ceramic reeds masquerading as coloured pencils, sat within personified pots emblazoned with cheeky cartoon faces (harking back to her \u2018Crisp Packet\u2019 handbag and, more recently, a candle collection designed with Lyn Harris). Hindmarch worked alongside two top-tier perfumers on the new scents: Domitille Michalon-Bertier concocts the herbal \u2018Chewing Gum\u2019, whilst former British Society of Perfumers president Marianne Martin conjures up the nostalgic classroom-inspired \u2018Pencil Shavings\u2019 and fruity \u2018Lollipop\u2019 aromas.\nHair removal is rarely enjoyable business, particularly for the fairer sex, but a new body care label with an eye-catching collection of products is helping women get the job done. Flamingo is the latest brainchild from the men\u2019s shaving brand Harry\u2019s and has applied its experience in razors, blades, handles and aftercare to creating a similarly thoughtful range for women. In addition to function and ergonomics \u2013 Flamingo razors have been specifically designed to hug female curves and come equipped with a lubricated shell for added moisture and rubber grips to prevent slippage \u2013 the Harry\u2019s team has also infused its Flamingo range with added benefits. Shaving gels also moisturise and body moisturises also exfoliate. The collection is rounded out by two at-home waxing kits; one for the face and one for the body. In addition to the soft gel wax strips that don\u2019t require heat, each kit comes with a step-by-step guide, so that they can be applied and used in the<|endoftext|>"

But I got his September Barkbox while he was at the park with his grandma, so I actually had a chance to go through this one!\nIn case you haven't heard of BarkBox, it is a monthly subscription program for dogs! They send out healthy, safe foods, toys, and accessories for your dog monthly. It's available for dogs of all sizes, and Rowan and I have loved everything we've received!\n1. Zigoo Crinket Toy. This is the large green tube-looking object...it's actually a brilliant idea - it's a durable tube meant to put an empty water bottle in! This way, the dog can chew and enjoy the crinkle noise without actually tearing up the bottle, possibly swallowing it or hurting himself on sharp edges. This will be great for Ro, he loves anything noisy. I love that BarkBox always sends durable toys...because he is quite a chewer.\n2. LA Fresh W.A.G. Bath Wipe - This is obviously more exciting for me than for Rowan. It's a premoistened wipe meant to clean up your dog on the go. He loves to get into mud and other gross things, so this will definitely come in handy!\n3. Barkworthies Bully Stick - pretzel: This is a bully stick in the shape of a pretzel. Rowan has already devoured it...he LOVED it. I love giving him safe things to chew on.\n4. Whole Life Pet Freeze Dried Sweet Potato treats. This is a great sized bag! I love giving Ro sweet potatoes, they're super healthy and these are nice and light and crisp, and definitely unique. We also received a small sample of the freeze dried chicken treats...which he apparently loved, because he snuck into the box when I went down to the bathroom and stole them.\n5. Zukes Z-Bones dental treat. Ro hates having his teeth brushed, so I love giving him dental treats! This is a green chew bone meant to clean the teeth and freshen breath. He apparently thought it tasted good, too, as he already devoured it!\nAnd finally, there was also a $10 coupon code for Wag.com. It was good for $10 off your first order from Wag.com which is a great site to buy pet supplies. Unfortunately, I have already ordered from them many times. so I can't use it. However, if you want my discount code, please feel free to leave me a comment and it's yours!\nAs usual, Rowan and I both LOVED our BarkBox. I appreciate the company and the care put into selecting products to send. I highly recommend it to anyone with a spoiled doggie!\nIf you are interested, you can sign up via my referral link OR using this coupon code: \"MITAC032\" tand you will save $5 off your order.\nThis month marked the end of my relationship with both Birchbox and Cravebox, so I was really hoping my remaining subs would send out good boxes to make up for it. Sample Society took a little longer than usual to get to me because of the holiday, but it came quickly once it shipped. But were the contents worth it?\nI like that the Beauty Bar boxes now have a pull tab to make them easier to open. I used to struggle with the outer boxes! I also still appreciate the packaging, itself - the Sample Society boxes are sturdy and cute and great for storage. I like to use them to organize my makeup...they hold up better than the Birchboxes!\nHere's what was inside this month. Good sized samples of good brands. I have consistently been happy with Sample Society's offerings. They tend to send out truly high end brands and products that are useful for most everyone. Of my subs, I'd say that Sample Society is, so far, the most \"sophisticated\".\nThe first item I pulled out was this EDT sample by diptyque. I love getting perfume samples, so I was excited to try this! They sent out several different scents by diptyque. This company is really interesting to me. They design most of these scents to be unisex and they all have really poetic, interesting descriptions. I received vetyverio, which is in the \"woody\" family and is inspired by forest vegetation. It has notes of citrus, vetiver, spices, and woods. I personally smell more vetiver than anything and I get very little of the citrus or fruit notes on me. It's definitely a high quality fragrance, and I found it to be quite complex...but I am not a fan of the scent itself. I don't find that it suits me, I tend to prefer a sweeter, more feminine scent. That said, I was really glad to try this brand and I would very much like to try more of their fragrances.\nI was really excited to get this Ahava Purifying Mud Mask. I love masks and I've heard great things about this brand. The sample is a great size, too. It's a mineral mud mask that promises to soften and purify the skin, get rid of excess oil, and clear and prevent blemishes and blackheads. I have tried it once, and I did like it. It left my skin feeling clean and fresh. I find it to be a good mask for my skin, and I will definitely consider buying the full sized product when I finish this.\nThis is a B Gloss by Borghese. It is what it looks like - a lip gloss. It boasts vitamins A and E, as well as jojoba oil, avocado oil, and aloe. The size is perfect to keep in my purse! I got the color \"Fiore\", which is a shimmery mauve color. I like the shade a lot, and find that it complements my complexion. I posted a photo below. I am not a huge fan of the gloss itself, though - it is a bit sticky. However, once it's been on for a few minutes, the stickiness does fade, and I find the wear to be decently long for a gloss. I will definitely use it, but I don't think I'd buy the full size.\nThis is Extremely Gentle Skin Cleanser by CellCeuticals, and it is also what it sounds like - a cleanser that is gentle. It's a great size (2 ounces)! It promises to hydrate as it cleans and to be suitable for sensitive skin. I've been using it at night (I exfoliate in the mornings, so I prefer something gentle at night) and I find that it is great at cleaning my skin without irritating it or leaving it tight. It's definitely a nice cleanser, but I do think there are plenty of products out there that do an equally good job for a more affordable price. I do enjoy this brand!\nAnd finally, a stila smudge crayon! I received the shade \"umber\" which is a nice brown. This is a cool product - it's a primer, shadow, and liner in one. It's nice and soft and creamy, and I did find it to be long lasting! The tip really is like a crayon - easy to make a nice even line. It's very easy to smudge to make a smoky eye. I love it and would love to try other colors as well. This is my favorite item in the box!\nThis is a thin layer of the Borgese B Gloss in Fiore on my bare lips (wow, that angle makes my nose look giant...) Definitely a nice, subtle color.\nIn all, I think this is a great box. The gloss and liner are perfect shades for fall, and the cleanser and mask are great for my skin. I do wish I'd gotten another scent of the perfume, but I'm still glad to have tried it. Sample Society remains possibly my favorite sub, and I'm glad to see them continuing to send out impressive boxes.\nHave you tried any good new products this month?\nSo, after last month's box, I had every intention to cancel my Birchbox subscription. In fact, I thought I had cancelled, but apparently I got distracted partway through or something, because I never actually finished canceling....so I was surprised to get a shipping notification this month. No big deal, just one last Birchbox. I was worried that it would be an amazing box, and I'd decide not to cancel after all. Luckily for me, that was not the case!\nThe September boxes don't really have a definite theme beyond \"The September Issue\", and they've given us a collection of things that are at least vaguely appropriate for fall. So, what did I get this month?\nAfter last month's larger box, this one was back in its normal box and mailer. I was surprised to get my box today, as my shipping information had not updated. It was still pretty late in the month to receive my box, though.\nBirchbox did something new this month, and put together this cute little fall trend guide that includes ten of their favorite fall beauty trends. I really liked this little mag, it's a cute touch and I'd love something like this to be included more often!\nThis is the Brighten Up! Enzymatic Face Rejuvenator by Vasanti. It's an exfoliating cleanser that uses microderm crystals and papaya enzymes to brighten the skin. It's a nice sized sample, and I look forward to trying it.\nThis is a variety kit from The Brush Guard. It includes 3 brush guards. They looked small, so I thought they'd just fit my<|endoftext|>"

Each glittering, iridescent creation reveals the wonders of perfumer Christine Nagel, who \u2013 inspired by the union of day and night \u2013 set out to capture the moment when light and darkness unite, where shadows move between the two and create a fleeting moment of mystery and movement. Deep, dark notes of black tea wrap around sweet incense and sensual tonka bean to bring smoky, woody, almost mineralic notes that conjure up images of warm stones in the sun before they\u2019re covered by a sea breeze and plunged into shadow.\nSuperstitious and fascinated by the stars, Gabrielle Chanel\u2019s lucky protector was the mighty lion \u2013 the fifth sign of the Zodiac that watched over her from the day she was born. \u201cI am a Leo, and, like a lion, I use my claws to prevent people from doing me harm\u201d, she said. Fast forward to today, and the lion has become one of the key symbols used in the house, from fashion to jewelry and now, in fragrance. \u201cI was much more interested in the emblematic Chanel lion than the animal\u201d, explains Olivier Polge, Chanel\u2019s Perfumer-Creator and the man behind this powerful oriental perfume. This isn\u2019t about a wild beast \u2013 it\u2019s a sophisticated, elegant, regal creature that doesn\u2019t need to roar to command respect. Notes of fiery black pepper and dazzling citrus are sparked by animalistic resin and rich amber, wrapped in smooth vanilla, creamy sandalwood, and musky raw patchouli. The spirit of a lion, coated in Chanel.\nIf you\u2019re after something softer, sweeter, and lighter for your summer\u2019s day, then Viktor & Rolf\u2019s new \u2018Flowerbomb Dew\u2019 is just the ticket. A fresh floral scent inspired by delicate drops of dewy moisture resting on a rose\u2019s petals in the morning dawn, it melts into the skin and instantly envelops you in the softness of fresh flowers. Blending sparkling and succulent top notes of pear accord and bergamot essence with a unique \u2018dewy rose\u2019 accord and an iris heart, it brings that dewy, water-kissed petal feeling straight to your fragrance. The dry down reveals a base of creamy vanilla, ambrette seeds, and soft musk to add depth and perfectly complement the delicate aroma of freshly picked flowers.\nIf canceled flights and travel restrictions have put all those vacation plans on hold, then you need to get your hands on the new (and first-ever) fragrance from cult beauty brand Sol de Janeiro. Bringing the beat of Brazil and the scent of its sell-out \u2018Bum Bum Cream\u2019 to the bottle, it will transport you to the sandy beaches of Rio with just a whiff. As Co-Founder and CEO Heela Yang explains, \u201cThe energy in Brazil is amazing and absolutely palpable. We wanted to do more than create a delicious fragrance \u2013 we wanted to capture the warmth and sensuality of Brazil in a bottle\u201d, and they did just that thanks to a decadent, addictive blend of pistachio, caramel, vanilla, jasmine, and sandalwood. If this isn\u2019t the scent of summer in a scent, we don\u2019t know what is. Eat your heart out, Gisele.\nOkay, so it\u2019s not a new fragrance per se, but it is a whole new look for Diptyque\u2019s classic \u2018Eau des Sens\u2019 scent. Part of the limited edition \u2018Impossible Bouquet\u2019 collection, which features unique fragrances inspired by nature, it\u2019s been given a stunning new visual display courtesy of Dutch \u201cdigital florist\u201d Bas Meeuws. And while we love all six scents, \u2018Eau des Sens\u2019, full of fresh and luminous orange blossom, is perfect for hot summer months and evenings by the beach. The proverbial cherry on top? That beautiful orange adorned bottle, perfect to bring a subtle splash of color to your bathroom shelf. The only problem is it\u2019s limited edition \u2013 so move, fast.\nOr, if it\u2019s the streets of Rome you\u2019re longing to pound, then Valentino\u2019s new fragrance \u2013 inspired by the Italian capital \u2013 is for you. A celebration of the city where the Maison was born, where streets steeped in history meet modern-day dreams, this olfactory creation celebrates classic perfumery but with a contemporary twist. An haute couture floriental modernized with woody undertones, it blends a trio of the world\u2019s best jasmine flowers with vanilla bourbon (one of perfumery\u2019s most expensive ingredients), warm woods, and a kick of fiery pink pepper. All housed in Valentino\u2019s iconic \u2018rockstud\u2019 adorned bottle, of course.\nOur olfactory journey continues down the Italian coast to Amalfi, where the deep blue gleaming waters of the Mediterranean glisten under the sun, and the sea breeze carries the soft scents of juicy fruits and fresh flowers that grow along the shore. It\u2019s here that inspired the creation Dolce & Gabbana\u2019s new \u2018Dolce Shine\u2019 scent \u2013 a delicious, fruity-floral scent that brings a splash of sunshine to any day. Fruity top notes of sweet, juicy mango, zesty grapefruit essence, and crisp quince make for a mouthwatering opening, before revealing a floral heart of bright jasmine and orange blossom. There\u2019s an unexpected ozonic salty accord reminiscent of sea air lightly touching the petals with fresh dew, and at its base, sundrenched blond woods, silky white musk, and smoky Australian sandalwood evoke the sensation of soft, warm, sun-kissed skin.\nThe next best thing to covering yourself in fresh rose petals? Rituals\u2019 new \u2018Rose de Shiraz\u2019 perfume. Inspired by exotic ingredients from the Orient, just one spritz transports you straight to summer\u2019s night beneath a clear star-strewn sky, where the curves of Persian rooftops mark the horizon and below you, narrow streets start to wind down as the aromas of market day linger in the air. Notes of rich, full, Damask rose are wrapped in musky ambrette, before a touch of zesty sweet rhubarb reveals itself. Sensual, seductive, and oh so addictive.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " Oudh wood and Oudh oil. Pure Oudh oil could cost anywhere between $300 to $1500 for a (tolah) which is around.5 grams, and the wood pieces are just as expensive.\nThe two main countries that produces Oudh nowadays are India and Cambodia, but the Indian is known for its superior quality.\nThe first Western brand that we, here in the UAE, started seeing using Oudh was Tom Ford's around 2 years ago, and after that many brands started following. Tom Ford's Oudh became very popular in this part of the world because finally we can use Oudh in it's third form; spray.\nIncense and oud is a great combination, if only because it evokes a mystical mood that is also deepened into non ecclesiastical nuances. Not that I have anything against the ecclesiastical incense vibe myself (adore it!) but several people have very specific associations and can't disentangle themselves from them. I think niche companies have cottoned on to that and thus bringing out several variations, some of them oud-laced etc. Since incense does have a \"spiritual\" vibe to it re: intended audiences and oud is the latest craziness in the niche-buying world, it made sense to combine the two. As you succinctly point out, there is stiff competition though, so it's always interesting to see how fares better in that game!\nHaven't thought about AS and Diptyque's Musc in that light (ha!) so I should probably heed your advice and compare side by side, so to speak. Thanks for the suggestion!!\na most interesting comment! Thank you!\nSome of my Arabian-heritage students had discussed the use of oud fumigation to me a few years back and it had made a very marked impression. I find the habit of sharing the fumes a very endearing one, if not very US-friendly, LOL A few brought me Yemen-hailing oud oils for my sampling pleasure, which was an experience worth the time.\nIt's interesting what you say about Tom Ford's Oudh, though, I didn't know it was popular in the Emirates, how fascinating! Do you sense that they use natural oud in it? I can't really recall my impressions, I think I have only briefly sampled that one.\nThe first brand that came into my attention proclaiming the use of oud was Montale (the French niche brand), but I found most of their wares rather \"westernised\" and synthetic. (Not that there's anything wrong with that, as long as it's clear and upfront. ) Now there's oud notes at every price point across brands, which obviously hints at the use of powerful synthetics (and which I happen to know ARE being used).\nI am not sure whether they're using natural Oudh, but personally, I didn't like any Western perfume that had Oudh in it. They do smell good, but not as good and authentic as the Oudh oil and natural Oudh woods we are used to wearing. As you mentioned, they usually contain a western twist to them.\nWe're familiar with Montale here, and is very popular too, but personally, I like the old fashioned Oudh, and sometimes I mix it with my favorite western fragrance; which happens to be Sycomore from Chanel exclusive collection. I don't usually wear women's fragrance, but I find Sycomore to be more masculine and Arabic than other Western Oudh-containing fragrances.\nArmani Prive collection's Bois d'encens, although not containing Oudh, but became very popular when was released here few years ago. We fumigate mystic gum as well, but it's used mainly as home fragrance, and its smell is exactly like Armani's Bois d'encens's. Maybe that's why it became popular.\nfascinating, simply fascinating!\nI should think that the westernised spin would be essential from a marketing point of you, because it would be idiotic to try to market oud to the middle east as the first line of attack (a bit like selling milk to cows or gold to a maharadjah). It was propably a very calculated move.\nBois d'Encens is possibly the best Armani fragrance (certainly in the Prive line). It's very deep and mystical.\nAs to Sycomore, how wonderful you love it too! I find it beautiful and very unisex: There is a chocolate edge to the smoky vetiver which surfaces some times, possibly due to a little patchouli or a woody-creamy note. Mixing it with real Oud sounds like Jannah has landed on earth!<|endoftext|>"

If you're a fan of easy, healthy, seasonal and tasty dishes, check it out. You won't be disappointed.\nThe result was so tasty, super healthy and ridiculously easy to put together. It's one to bust out if you want to look like you've tried really hard, when in actual fact you only had a few minutes spare to chuck it all together.\nThere may be some bits you'd prefer to leave out. You might want to add your own accompaniments. It's entirely up to you. This combination worked really well for me, but I might try adding some glazed salmon to the mix next time. Mix it up a bit.\nCharred cauliflower. To make life really easy you could use ready floretted (is that a word?) cauliflower. I couldn't find this so, once I'd prepped the cauli, just thinly sliced some of the florets and quartered the others. Spread them in a single layer over a foil-lined baking tray, drizzle with olive oil, the juice of half a lemon, then sprinkle with some garlic salt, sea salt and black pepper. Chuck in a pre-heated oven at 180 and roast for approx 40 mins. I take it out when it's started to crisp up and looks nice and charred at the edges. It's truly delicious.\nQuinoa salad, with pomegranate, toasted almonds, feta and chargrilled chicken. I used some ready-cooked red and white quinoa, which I mixed with approx 100g pomegranate seeds (you can buy these ready removed, which makes life much easier), two sliced spring onions, a tin of chickpeas, cubed feta and toasted flaked almonds. I mixed this through with the juice of a lemon, sea salt and cracked black pepper and a tsp of sugar. Top with the sliced cooked chicken and serve.\nTenderstem broccoli with crispy prosciutto and honey mustard dressing. Boil or steam your broccoli for 5 mins, drain and add to a heatproof dish. Arrange slices of prosciutto on top and place under a preheated grill until the prosciutto starts to crisp. Remove from grill and drizzle with a honey mustard dressing.\nI served the dishes with some garlic stuffed green olives, sliced avocado, chopped red, yellow and green cherry tomatoes and toasted pitta with houmous and tzatziki.\nThis kind of food is right up my street. Healthy, full of flavour and a strong possibility of leftovers for the following day. Perfect.\nThis week's meal plan is designed to use up some of the meat and fish in my freezer. I can barely close the drawers at the moment, so I need to use things up and defrost it (anyone else really hate that job?).\nI made a selection of vegetable-based dishes for dinner one night last week and it was so good I'll definitely make that again this week. Keep your eyes peeled for a post on that later in the week.\nAs always, I only plan for six meals just in case I get whisked out for a romantic meal for five, or in the event of 'pizza pressure'.\nI'd love to have a nose at your weekly menus, if you fancy sharing.\n2. The most beautiful playground.\n3. Loved spending time with this little pickle and the beach to ourselves.\n4. Tea of the week. Hands down. I'll write a full post on this selection of dishes later in the week.\n5. The first hint of sunshine and I'm on the Pimms. This limited edition flavour was really good.\n6. My little baby Thor in training.\n7. Out for the evening to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We tried a new local restaurant and had a great time. The food, service and cocktails were excellent.\n8. What better way to toast World Gin Day than with an Elderflower Collins. And it was as good as it looks.\nI know, I witter on about how much we love being so close to the sea a lot. But last week I had a moment of feeling very grateful for where we live.\nAyden and I spend a lot of time in parks, toddler groups and classes and at home. But one sunny day last week, straight after the morning school run, we headed to the beach to play. And we had the whole place to ourselves.\nThe Incredible Hulk came with us. That poor little Lego figure had quite the ordeal - buried in sand, dunked in a rock pool,'smashed' with pebbles and left for dead on the sand.\nWe ran, built sand castles, climbed rocks, collected stones and gave them a bath in the rock pools. Ayden wanted to go and look at the 'big bath', but not too close because he's still not sure how he feels about the waves.\nIt was so lovely to have space to ourselves. Just me and Ayden. And The Hulk.\nThis week I'm finally feeling it. I've got the legs out (eek), the SPF to the front of my skincare stash and I don't want to see another soup or casserole for at least 8 to 12 weeks.\nYes, it may be a little greyer today than I'd like, but it's warm. Really warm in fact. And I'm ready to welcome the great British summer with open arms... even if my legs aren't.\nSand. Everywhere. Between our daily trips to the beach, the sand table in the back garden and the amazing 24-7 shedding labrador (seriously, it's unbelievable), I may as well leave the hoover plugged in for the whole summer. But I wouldn't change a thing. Although I am tempted to shave the dog.\nCold. Ice-cream, lollies, pink lemonade on ice, homemade slushies.... Pimms. Ah. There's nothing better than enjoying cold stuff in a hot garden.\nToes. Is there anything cuter than tiny toes in cute little summer shoes? I think not. We're definitely a family of flip-flop fans; the second it's warm enough, out come the sandals.\nMusic. It's become a bit of a summer tradition, every Sunday evening after the kids are in bed, Dan and I sit on deck chairs in the back garden with a bottle of red wine, candles lit, blankets and the laptop and listen to our favourite songs on Spotify for hours. We just sit there and chat. It's nothing unusual; we listen to the same songs all year round, but something about our little summer routine makes it seem special.\nTime. There's so much more of it in the summer. I love having the children off school with me, with nowhere to rush to and nothing in particular to do. Dan usually finishes work a bit earlier, so we can all go off to the beach when everyone else is packing up to go home. We spend the last few hours of sunlight running in the sea, having picnics on the sand and enjoying our time together.\nIt's just after an alfresco lunch and I'm stretched out on a picnic blanket under the shade of a beautiful fig tree. Book in hand, wine and olives by my side; basking in the Mediterranean sunshine.\nOh god, I'd give anything for that to be true... a girl can daydream.\nIn reality, I've grabbed 20 minutes to myself to write this while Ayden naps. Once I'm done I have to empty the dishwasher and go pick labrador turds off the lawn.\nI may not be lying underneath that fig tree, but these beautiful fig-scented products are the next best thing.\nThe love affair began when I was 21 and purchased my first ever Diptyque candle. I couldn't really afford it, but I was in Liberty beauty hall so it would have been rude not to. I picked up the Figuier scent and it was love at first sniff. That candle lasted me years - I never wanted to burn it, because I never wanted it to run out. Plus, I couldn't afford another one!\nFast forward five years (ok, a few more than five) and I'm still just as obsessed with all things figgy.\nIf I had to choose a'signature scent' for myself (god, I hate that term), I'd have to go for Diptyque Philosykos. Basically the candle that started the love affair, in perfume form.\nThink warm summer evenings on exotic shores and you'll be half way there. The scent is fresh, intoxicating and I get complimented on it more frequently than any other fragrance. It's the perfect summer scent.\nThe eau de toilette doesn't seem to last all that long on my skin, so I picked up the perfumed oil roller ball in the same scent to carry around in my bag. This seems to last fairly well for top ups.\nA close runner-up to Philosykos would be Jo Malone's Wild Fig and Cassis cologne. A slightly fruitier offering than Diptique, but just as lovely. I have this one as a candle rather than the perfume. As you can see, it's been well loved so far. It lives in my bedroom and is the perfect calming scent and fills the room with summer.\nThe newest addition to<|endoftext|>"

I would also add Paloma Picasso's fragrance to the rose -chypres and Patou's EnJoy,YSL Baby Doll+flankers,as fruity rose scents. I'd love to be in the draw-to revisit some and experience others for the first time!\nWill put you in the draw!!\nI LOVE rose scents, especially in warm weather. Some of my favourites are Le Labo Baie Rose 26 (which, according to my husband, makes me smell like a teenage party), Serge Lutens Sa Majeste La Rose wich I find carry just the right balance between innocent rose, sexy honey and even sexier wood, and really just any unremarkable, middle of the road musky rose, layered with Mandy Afteliers Oud Luban.\nYeah for Sa Majeste, it gets a lot of love with good reason. I still haven't tried that Baie Rose, it's the only city exclusive that's eluded me so far.\nI LOVE rose scents, especially in warm weather.

I think that's the only one of the city exclusives I haven't smelled!\nMy absolute favorite rose is Serge Lutens Sa Majeste La Rose. For me, nothing comes close!\nY'all that love the Sa Majeste really are faithful to it! I know Tom is too. I do love it, too.\nI'm so glad you mentioned Mohur, my favorite! One lovely rose/patchouli combo that didn't get mentioned is Hippie Rose by James Heeley. It's full of sparkling girly rose goodness and it's what I wish young women were wearing.\nMohur is so gorgeous, seriously. When I tested those three, I didn't think that would be the one i loved, but it was! I'm going to have to look around for the Hippie Rose. I know that's a good one, but I just forgot it!\nI have to pour over your list to find a few to try - roses are sometimes hard for me to wear. I like the Guerlains, Rose Barbare and even Nuit d'Amour since it doesn't have a trace of sourness. I even like - gasp - Balenciaga's Florabotanica - it's mainstream but it has a vegetal quality and is light-years better than other dept. store roses, Chloe L'Eau I'm looking at you!\nI have to smell that Florabotanica! I have a sample around here somewhere, but I've been covered in gardenia and roses the last two weeks, no room for anything else!\nHi Patty, my favorite roses lately have been Poussiere de Rose from les Parfums de Rosine, the MDCI Rose di Siwa, and Diptyque Eau de Rose. I am still hunting for a scent to match the long-gone Agnes B Rose scent. What a great giveaway!\nI dont' think I ever had the Agnes B scent. I remember the regular one. Was this another one?\nTauer's Incense Rose and Kerosene's Whips and Roses are my two rose scents at this point. But, I am searching for more. Thanks for the list.\nTo be perfectly honest, I'm not a fan of the rose note and so I cannot state my favourite rose scent. I've tried to like it as most people rave over it, but personally I'm always reminded of the too-sweet rose syrup which I drank as a child. Perhaps I've not been exposed to good rose scents.\nYeah, it depends on what you've tried, but you may not like rose in any way!\nOh, my gosh! So many Rose scents - so little time! Thanks for the draw.\nYou are so welcome, and good luck!\nFor me that would be SSS Vintage Rose, which introduced me to A) Niche perfumes and B) the fact that rose perfumes actually could smell good and not at all only of cheap handcream. After that I tried quite some others. I also love Ta'if and Rose Oud. A big dissappointment however was the Mona di Orio Rose etoile d'Hollande. On my skin it turned into a patchouli powerhouse, I could not even find a trace of rose.\nI need to smell that Mona just for reference. So many ta'if and rose oud fans, that's awesome!\nps: I'm in Europe, so I'm not sure if I can be entered in the draw. Would be nice, but I do understand if this isn't possible.\nTauer's Une Rose Vermeille!!! and Tresor Midnight Rose are two in my collection and two that I love!\nYou can never go wrong with a Tauer rose, period!\nPatty You can never go wrong with a Tauer rose, period!\nDon't enter me as I'm in the UK! Surprised to see that nobody has mentioned Yves Rocher's Rose Absolue, which is very good and quite similar to Lancome's Mille et Une Roses, and good value and not discontinued. Also Cartier's So Pretty, which is so like Nahema (and cheaper!). My favourite rose is OJ's Ta'if, and I am glad to see it getting a lot of love here. And AG's Rose Absolue.\nOh, I'm fine with sending to Europe. so unless you really don't want to be entered, I'll put you in! Ta'if is seriously so beautiful. I sometimes forget about it, then pick it up and fall in love with it all over again.\nI have always been a rose fragrance lover. I went through bottles of Ombr\u00e9 Rose as a teenager. Even now I have a collection of Roses to match my mood - Rose 31, Portrait of a Lady, and Epic when I am feeling bold. I love the new Atelier Rose Anonyme and found it refreshing and easy to wear in the heat - same with Antonia's Flowers Tiempe Passant with it's salty note. My favorite new rose is Mohur. The most heartbreakingly beautiful use of rose I have ever smelled was Hermes Doblis. Heavenly.\nOh, what a great set of favorites! Agree on the Mohur. I keep contemplating a full bottle, but then I think a set of them in her coffret would be great!\nOnce while taking Ambien, I shopped in my sleep. I bought a bottle of Lyric. I had no idea what it was. lol I love it!\nJulieT Once while taking Ambien, I shopped in my sleep.\nHilarious! But kinda tragic for your wallet.\nWhat a great list! So many more roses to try. My three favorite roses are PoAL, L'Arte di Gucci and Le Labo Rose 31.\nYou guys really all have such great taste, and I'm always surprised to see lots of other people who knot eh L'Ar<|endoftext|>"

This timeless citrus fragrance draws on zesty notes of Sicilian lemon, green mandarin and bergamot.\nInspired by Coco Chanel herself, Coco Mademoiselle is a bold, fresh scent made with the brand\u2019s signature jasmine. Added notes of rose, patchouli and vetiver contribute to an oriental, woody fragrance that recalls the spirit of Chanel.\nCutting-edge Parisian fragrance house Ex Nihilo is a go-to brand for those wanting to escape the mass-produced perfumes.

Perhaps the Holiest of my Holy Grail, Bois des Iles is the proof that wood can be feminine, warm and sensual. A veritable magical elixir, Bois des Iles is an olfactory equivalent of liquid gold.\n5. Bois des Paradis by Parfums Delrae. One of the most beautiful scents ever created, this is a seamless, magical harmony, a luscious, sensual and irresistible fragrance of the Garden of Eden.\n6. Collection by Escada. My comfort scent extraordinaire; whenever I am cold, tired and miserable, I put on some Collection and instantly I am soothed and warmed by its sweet, smoky, velvety aroma.\n7. F\u00e9minit\u00e9 du Bois by Shiseido. Fruity, woody and spicy, this a scent in which cedar, my favorite note, shows its warm, extremely sensual side. A hearty scent, darkly sweet and robust, it is tied up with Bois des Iles for the title of The Holiest Holy Grail.\n8. Fifi by Fifi Chachnil. A stunning fragrance, sexy and full of character, unconventional, playful and tr\u00e8s f\u00e9minin ; Fifi tops the list of my favorite \"pinup scents\".\n9. Or des Indes by Maitre Parfumeur et Gantier. The soft spiciness of this warm, smooth scent is soothing and comforting. This is a rather underappreciated scent that I never want to be without.\n10. Pomegranate Noir by Jo Malone. A fruity scent that is dry, woody and spicy. This is a fragrance that miraculously manages to be dark and transparent all at the same time.\nThe honorable mention also goes to the following fragrances I enjoyed in 2005: Bal \u00e0 Versailles by Jean Desprez; Bois et Fruits, Bois Oriental, Bois et Musc, and Daim Blond by Serge Lutens; Le Parfum de Therese and Noir Epices by Frederic Malle; Organza Indecence by Givenchy; Talco Delicato by i Profumi di Firenze; Trouble by Boucheron, Youth Dew Amber Nude by Estee Lauder.\n*The Best of 2005 graphic is by Katie (Scentzilla!). The painting is Holy Grail by Rossetti.\nThe latest addition to Frederic Malle\u2019s Editions de Parfums, Carnal Flower was created by Dominique Ropion, the nose behind Aimez Moi, Pure Poison, Amarige, and Alien (among many other scents). Ropion\u2019s goal was to come up with a scent that was as close to real tuberoses as possible, which meant that, like tuberoses found in nature, Carnal Flower had to \u201cexude a mixture of flowershop freshness and carnal opulence.\u201d In my opinion, Monsieur Ropion fulfilled the first part of that formula; Carnal Flower is certainly fresh, but, even though it is quite strong (to the extent that, when I smell it, I can actually taste it my mouth), it does not convey opulence, sumptuousness, or any sort of carnal image.\nThe first impression is of a pretty, fresh, spring-like scent; the beginning is slightly citrusy and gently floral, with bergamot, tuberose and orange blossom being the most prominent notes, to my nose. As the fragrance develops, it becomes more intense, at the same time the cold, harsh accords of eucalyptus and camphor come into play. Carnal Flower is almost like Tubereuse Criminelle in reverse. In Lutens\u2019s creation the cold menthol-like accord comes first, shocking in its unexpected weirdness, thus preparing us for the entrance of tuberose, which seems exceptionally stunning, absolutely exquisite in contrast with the jolting ugliness of the top notes. In Carnal Flower, the lively and lovely, spring-like sunny prettiness comes first and, instead of being let to continue blossoming, it is more or less overwhelmed by the unpleasant middle notes. As far as I am concerned, the fragrance never quite recovers, even though the drydown, consisting of tuberose, a little bit of orange blossom, and a dash of musk, is much more pleasant than the middle stage.\nLike Diptyque\u2019s new tuberose scent, Do Son, Carnal Flower is a heady but fresh, almost \u201cgreen\u201d tuberose fragrance. I am not quite sure what note or combination of notes was meant to convey the carnal aspect of tuberose, whatever it was, it did not manifest itself on my skin and to my nose. As far as I am concerned, Fracas still reigns supreme as the most Carnal of all floral scents.\nCarnal Flower is available at Editions de Parfums, or at Barneys, $155 for 50 ml, $230 for 100 ml.\nNot having smelled Nombre Noir when it was first launched, I cannot possibly tell whether (or rather how much) the mini I received from the wonderfully generous C., has been damaged by the passage of time. It does not smell \u201coff\u201d in any way, to my nose, but still, some notes could have been lost, weakened or changed. My first impression was black, woody rose with a certain boozy, wine-y undertone, which I believe fits the description of damascone molecule. It is a stunning accord, rich, dark, and smoky. As the fragrance develops, it assumes a vaguely fruity quality, these are not fresh fruits, rather, the note makes me think of raisins and dried plums. Closer to the drydown, Nombre Noir acquires an accord that I can only describe as very black tea, almost lapsang-souchong-like in its dark smokiness. At this point it actually reminds me a little of another very smoky scent, Eau des Iles by Maitre Parfumeur et Gantier. Nombre Noir is a gorgeous, brooding, nocturnal perfume, perhaps \u201cgothic\u201d would be a word to describe it. It is exactly what I wanted Lutens\u2019s Rose de Nuit to be like.\nNombre Noir is beautiful and unusual, and if it were more widely available (and much less expensive), I would have bought a bottle. Having said that, when facing a very expensive and very rare fragrance, I always ask myself Hemingway\u2019s question from For Whom the Bell Tolls: \u201cBut did thee feel the earth move?\u201d In the case of Nombre Noir, the answer is no, I did not. Striking as it is, this perfume strangely fails to amaze and captivate me.\nNombre Noir can sometimes be found on eBay, where it can go for as much as $40.00 (and often more!) for a 4ml miniature.\n*The painting is Black Rose by Anthony Falbo, it and other Falbo\u2019s works can be found here.\nDaim Blond, one of Lutens\u2019s Eaux de Parfum Haute Concentration was inspired by (white) suede; it has the notes of iris, apricot kernel, cardamom, musk, heliotrope, and hawthorn, and is one of my Holy Grail fragrances. If I had to describe its smell with one word, the word would be Expensive. To me this is a smell of understated luxury, impeccable taste and natural elegance. Apart from smelling expensive, Daim Blond does indeed smell like suede, albeit suede that has absorbed its wearer\u2019s rather sweet fruity-floral perfume.\nApricot and suede notes appear simultaneously as soon as Daim Blond is applied to my skin, these two notes are the most prominent to my nose and continue to go side by side and are noticeable till the very drydown. Other notes appear and disappear as the fragrance develops. Iris shows briefly among the top notes, cardamom and heliotrope pop up in the middle stage, and musk is quite evident in the drydown, doing what musk does best, bringing a little animalic oomph to the composition. The drydown also has a certain dark nuttiness/ slight powderiness that I associate with hawthorn, one of my favorite notes.\nDaim Blond is a sumptuous scent, it is rich, warm and, as much as I love it, I must admit it is often rather overwhelming in hot weather. It is however stunning on cold days and absolutely exquisite in minus temperatures; every note becomes clearly defined and practically sings in the icy air. The staying power of this scent is commendable, ten, sometimes twelve hours on my skin.\nDaim Blond is available at Aedes, $120.00 for 1,69ml.\n*The painting is Perfume Pearls by Trish Biddle.\nLe Boise is part of the fragrance line developed by Bordeaux winemaker Ginestet. The collection consists of three scents, each evocative of the flavors of wine: Botrytis, sweet, honeyed scent reminiscent of<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " what everyone is getting each month!\nWell, Sample Society has fulfilled one purpose, which is to get me to buy full size products. I just ordered both of the Alterna products (the strand expand cream and 48 hour volume spray) that I received awhile back. Stuff *never* works on my long fine hair so I fell in love once I saw actual results. They totaled up to just under $50, so I was going to add a mini Ahava lotion to use the $15 off code, but using their 20% off code for first time users without the lotion (which I didn't really need anyway) ended up being a better deal. I also had a $5 credit, so I was able to get both full size products for $35 plus they threw in a really awesome Philosophy GWP and a free soap.\nPretty nice first shopping experience with Beauty Bar I must say (Editing to add that my order shipped already - wow!) Sometimes Sample Society bores me a bit, but as I said I think that's just overall sample burnout because truthfully I am discovering some great stuff. I'm going to stick with it for awhile. I haven't gotten this month's box yet and I'm not that excited by what my dashboard shows, but who knows. I might be pleasantly surprised again!\nTheir customer service is really stellar. That alone is enough to keep me hanging on through a few \"blah\" boxes. Sorry you didn't like your first box, that *is* certainly a bummer.\nWhen they send a great box, they send a GREAT BOX and that gives me the guts to plod through the occasional bummers they send. I'm still impressed with the full-size Vincent Longo shadow we got last fall, and for the most part the sample sizes are excellent. And the service is hard to beat. In January, I was missing a product and they refunded me the entire cost of the box; this month, I got an empty tube of mineral tinted cream and got a $5 store credit. I have never been made to feel like they thought I was lying or trolling for discounts.\nYea that mineral cream was REALLY empty, haha. I mean...just put it in a dang foil packet! They do point out more than once on their site that each of their samples are \"deluxe\" which means \"you can use the product more than once\" and stuff, so that cream definitely did not fall into that category.\n(forgive my hideous nails) I mean c'mon...lol. That's before I had even tried it!\nI got the Sam box bit haven't had a chance to do.more than peek. Now I want to go home and squeeze all the tubes. Good thing it's almost the weekend.\nSample society frequently sends out half empty tubes. I've heard mixed things from people who have complained about this. They sent me a survey in Sept and I mentioned it on the survey and they sent me a $5 certificate & I haven't received any half empty tubes since (although I haven't tried my Jane Iredale self tanner yet). I have tons of samples from sephora & other places & never experienced so little products in tubes like this, so it's a quality control issue more than it's a small tube & hard to fill issue.\nI received box E this month & immediately tried 3 things, which is a first. A lot of times it sits around for a while. I used the hair clip, the diptyque, & the CC cream. The next day I had a ton of flakes in my hair, not sure if it was the cream or if my hair is having a flaky day, I'll have to use it a second time to see. I was excited to try the diptyque because so many people rave about it, but it's my least favorite perfume ever. Not sure if they make better scents or if this just reacted with my body funny.\nYea that mineral cream was REALLY empty, haha. I mean...just put it in a dang foil packet! They do point out more than once on their site that each of their samples are \"deluxe\" which means \"you can use the product more than once\" and stuff, so that cream definitely did not fall into that category. (forgive my hideous nails) I mean c'mon...lol. That's before I had even tried it!\nI got this tiny blip of cream about the size of a comma, and that was after squeezing the living snot out of that tube! It was not enough to do a single cheek. The guy I spoke with was very nice about the whole thing, saying he had a lot of calls from people who'd received half-filled tubes and he'd told them that it should have been sufficient for several uses. I said it would have been all well and good had I gotten a half-filled tube instead of a tube full of air!\nThis was my box with an amost empty tube of the tan stuff. Would have liked it besides that!\nIn order to use my $15 code do i have to purchase one of the items i received in full size or can it be travel size?\nSS I am putting this out into cyberspace for you...send caudaile products and nail polish next month!\nTry it on the site, but I think you just have to have a product from a brand in your box, it does not matter the size or if it is the product you had in your box.\nI won't use the hairpins anyway, but Laurenv78 mentioned that it would be better if we got two matching ones. That's a really good point and just so true. If I did ever use that sort of item in my hair, I'd use two and want them to be identical. That really is the only part of this box that's a fail for me.\nThat's a good point, I would have rather had two clip style hair pins, I don't mind if they don't match prints or colors but I can't use the bobby pin style one it's slides in my hair too much since my hair is fine, thin and naturally oily. Seems silly just to trade my one bobby pin. Oh well.\nYESSSS Give me ALLLL the candles!!!\nHas anyone been using their codes to make purchases from Beautybar? I ask because, as much as I love my Sephora points, Beautybar has awesome free gifts with purchase. I'm not sure if it's just this month or what, but I ordered some hair products and they threw in an Erno Laszlo cleansing bar and a very generous Philosophy set. I went back today to order the matching shampoo and conditioner and they added a free Butter London eye pencil! Their shipping is super fast too. I promise I don't work for Beautybar, I'm just a sucker for free stuff!\nA candle?!?!  Re-cancelling.\nMy box came with the tanning tube, it was EMPTY! Everything was super tiny and the hair pins looked like they were from the 90's.\nI promptly cancelled, for $16 I was so upset I received this, IMO 'joke box'. After reading that you guys had some of the same issues I emailed Sample Society about it and you know what they offered me?! $5 off my next purchase on beautybar.com! Wow, $5! I have to spend at least $10 plus shipping to even get anything off their website and I don't feel like spending more because I received an EMPTY product.\nSo yeah, lesson learned. If you're going to complain to a sub box customer service about the items you received or DIDN'T receive, don't cancel first or they won't lift a finger helping you or keeping you as a customer!\nNever had a problem with any other sub company, especially Birchbox, when my oil broke in my box last month, they sent a new box immediately. And that's only $10 a month.\nSorry for the rant guys, I know some of you love Sample Society, it just isn't for me after this!\nEdit: Not to mention this was my first box with them, what an impression!\nUgh, sorry you had that experience. I've had good experiences with their customer service, but my box this month kind of sucked, and if it were my first I'd be considering cancellation too.<|endoftext|>"

CHANEL, COACH, DIPTYQUE, LALIQUE, PARFUMS DE MARLY and many other prestigious brands are among its references.\nThe company continues to strive for innovation and development, in full compliance with its Quality and CSR strategy and is investing and developing new technologies for metallization as well as strengthening its R&D to maintain a top level of customer satisfaction.\nPRAD proposes the following key technologies: liquid metallization, lacquering, laser finishing, silk screening, pad printing and hot stamping. Used individually or combined, they allow a wide range of renderings, shades, colour and/or material effects, and extreme precision of patterns. The high-quality decorations catch the eye as much as they encourage the touch, providing the brands sensory experience of their packaging.\nPRAD relies on its modern equipment, its environment-friendly industrial practices and processes.

Stimulated by a customer, PRAD developed metallization varnishes for glass and thus became a specialist in this field.\nAware of the creative and industrial advantages of varnishing glass bottles, G\u00e9rard B\u00e9ranger invented glass lacquering in the 1980s. This technology was put into practice with the launch of Rose Cardin, the first line of lacquered bottles for a selective fragrance.\nSince 2016, PRAD is managed by Bruno Pierrain, its current owner.<|endoftext|>"

I love you all.\nMy days are busy as I navigate \u201cthe system\u201d to help a family member with chronic mental health challenges. It\u2019s hard but worth it. If you or someone you love needs help, reach out as often as you can.\nAnd remember self-care, whatever that means to you. For me it meant on Thursday I had my first ever fancy salon haircut, paid for by a wonderful benefactor, my own Professor Henry Higgins! The stylist was lovely to me. When I asked about the grays around my temples he cleared his schedule and spent two hours giving me my first highlights.\nNow I\u2019m blonde again, my hair looks like it did 20 years ago, and I feel so much lighter. I just washed and air-dryed my hair this morning, no styling tools or products, and my hair looks great. Amazing what an expert cut can do for hair.\nHere\u2019s to hoping everyone is enjoying this Saturday! I\u2019m going to tackle my to do list so tonight I can watch the movie Loving Vincent. Then I might look for something with Christopher Walken to enjoy. Is it odd that I had a crush on him when I was in my 20s? He is so graceful.\nGood for you! Yes, nothing can brighten up a day more then a nice cut and/or color. Glad you love it and that you felt wrapped in care yourself.\nthank you, Kelly Red hugs to you!\nit\u2019s a happy thing for sure, thank u!\ntiffanie!! I\u2019ve missed you. Sending oh so many hugs in your direction. I\u2019ve thought of you a lot lately \u2013 my life is also stressful right now, and on the days when fragrance can\u2019t add to the stress I always proclaim \u201cYes to Hermes\u201d, choose an Hermes fragrance and think fondly of you.\nYour hair sounds fabulous! I hope you have a great weekend.\nYes to Hermes! Yay for Eau des Merveilles!\nSistine, I hope your weekend has treated you to some moments of happiness.\nFresh hair, what a joy! I can\u2019t wait for mine to grow out to the length I want so I can finally get it styled properly. Glad to see your joyful posts again!\nthank you, and good on you, cazaubon, for having the patience to wait for you hair to grow out. I\u2019ve avoided very short cuts most of my life because growing it out is. just. so. slow!\nLove hearing the skip in your step!\nla la la! thanks, OF, I\u2019m feeling skippy today.\nWoo hoo! I fresh hair cut and highlights are the bomb! Glad you\u2019re easing back and also thinking about self-care!\nit\u2019s the bomb indeed! I have to start a \u201csalon fund\u201d on my budget spreadsheet, right under the line for perfume, LOL.\nCongratulations on the new cut and color. I\u2019ve always found a good haircut (especially in a new style) is the best pick-me-up. Good luck with navigating the system.\nthank u, Sapphire the ship is steady as she goes navigation-wise. And it is A-MA-Zing what a great hair cut can do!\nI confess to being seriously in love with Jon Snow.\nI have a few things on today. I will settle on one for later on, after a shower. On the left arm, Hermes Eau de Neroli Dore, Panier des Rose Geranium & Prada Infusion d\u2019Iris. On the right arm, Guerlain Idylle, Evyan White Shoulders & Guerlain Aqua Allegoria Ginger Piccante.\nWow, what did you end up choosing? It sounds like you smell amazing.\nI don\u2019t care for pencil shavings, as the smell reminds me of school. I do care for Christopher Walken.\nI will be spending time with my grand niece today to visit the Easter bunny. I\u2019m in just one spray of Atelier Silver Iris.\nAwww, have a wonderful time with your niece and the Easter Bunny. \n Enjoy your day!\nEnjoy the Easter Bunny with your grand niece! I went to the mall last Sunday and the Easter Bunny looked very low energy.\nSotd: Chanel\u2019s Pour Monsieur (edt). Understated and elegant. I don\u2019t know why the heck I don\u2019t reach for this more often. To me, it\u2019s perfect. Enjoy the weekend my fellow \u2018fumeheads!\nAlso chose Chanel PM today, an absolute favorite that I somehow manage to forget about for long stretches. It\u2019s almost as if it\u2019s my taken-for-granted, but awesome, girlfriend. PM is on my very short list of fumes that I find both remarkably easy to wear but also damn interesting. Enjoy your day, Sayitisntso!\nI\u2019m wearing Tom Ford Gray Vetiver today, as a relief from all the neroli sweetness of last week. I may need a decant.\nI should pull out my Guerlain Vetiver, have not worn it in ages!\nLemonilla smells like soft limoncello and is quite nice, although it seems more a hot weather scent. Definitely not Lemon Pledgy, the vanilla really makes it more wearable.\n This has iris, chocolate and vanilla. I don\u2019t smell much chocolate which is why spring comes to mind.\nA kind soul slipped in a sample of CJ Scent Goddess of Dreams in my freebie and I love that one too! That lead me to the site and 10 samples I\u2019m working my way through.\nWhat is CJ Scents? I googled the site, but there isn\u2019t much information.\nShe\u2019s an indie perfumer. Her scents are nice. I\u201dve sampled maybe ten of her scents a few years ago. Lemonilla was nice. It was lemon cake or lemon cookies for me.\nDoing some comparative testing with Diptyque Eau Duelle (less sweet, not super green once it dries down) and Guerlain\u2019s Angelique Noir (sweet, but green)!\nMore recs for green-bitter vanillas?\nFelanilla has green, dry vanilla aa a note.\nI was reading about Felanilla and see it has iris. Does that translate into carrots or something else? Does it share any DNA with Indochine?\nI\u2019d have to do a side by side comparison. Felanills is dry green medicinal vanilla with iris and a banana leaf note. The iris is not rooty. It\u2019s really hard to dedcribe.\nI don\u2019t see (smell) any connection to Indochine.\nI\u2019ll track some down!\nI\u2019m in Carthusia Mediterraneo this morning, and just ordered a BUB as a belated birthday gift since my little bottle is draining quickly. It\u2019s gorgeous here today, so later on I\u2019ll be in Eau de Back Yard. We had camellia buds by the dozen a couple of weekends ago, so I\u2019m hoping for blooms today.\nOhhh, \u201cbrave\u201d is definitely the word! I\u2019m having the same thoughts about Gardener\u2019s Choice down near King City \u2013 it\u2019s my favorite nursery, and I have a gift certificate from there, but madhouse is the word, for sure!\nHave you tried Garden Fever at Fremont and NE 24th?It\u2019s a little more low key and the owner is lovely.\nNo, sounds great though!\nMy (former) house is pretty far out SE, so even the Division Portland Nursery is a bit of a trek. New abode will be much closer to more options, which will be welcome for sure!\nIt\u2019s cold and rainy here in Northwest Arkansas this weekend, so am wearing Estee Lauder Amber Ylang Ylang. Have posted an extra to my swaps.\nI think you smell just wonderful. Amber Ylang Ylang is so gorgeous. I can\u2019t stop smelling myself every time I wear it.\nEL Amber Ylang Ylang is PERFECTION! I am still kicking myself for not buying a bottle when it was available. \nStill undecided between vintage Diorissimo or Prada Infusion d\u2019Iris absolu. We are off soon to a birthday party for my FIL. This is a BIG birthday celebration, so I want to remain under the radar but still smell nice. It is a lovely sunny day today.\nI hope the celebration is wonderful. I don\u2019t think you can go wrong with either of those choices.\nThe neighbor next door has an oak tree that loses its leaves in spring. Last night I had a dream that my patio had no leaves on it and looked freshly washed. Alas, I woke up and the leaves and dirt are still there. I\u2019m making German chocolate cake today and maybe, just maybe, I\u2019ll go clean the patio afterward. SOTD is Sarrasins.\nA pox on neighbours with messy trees! We have pine trees on one side dropping sap and needles on our cars and a loquat tree on the other side dropping rotting fruit and leaves on our concrete path and trash bin area. Can\u2019t do anything about either. Grrr.\n<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " ethnic label and into greener market. The products are now made with some certified organic ingredients and include a long list of natural oils and plant extracts. However, they still contain quite a few chemicals, colors and the eyebrow-raising SLS (in the shampoo I tested) and parabens (both shampoo and conditioner). It's especially weird that the Red Clover & Aloe Soothing Shampoo, which is formulated for a flaky scalp has SLS, a known irritant, in it. Personally, my scalp is very sensitive and many famous brands' shampoos make me itch terribly, but Sodium Laureth Sulfate does not affect me. I found the shampoo to be mild and rich enough to help detangle my hair. Still, I don't get why they had to use this ingredient.\nThe big success from this line, as far as I'm concerned, is the Jojoba & Olive Oil deep conditioning treatment. When they say \"deep conditioning\", they really mean it. It took me a couple of tries to realise that I don't need any additional product after using it. That's a new experience for me: I'm a leave-in conditioner addict, but this heavy-duty conditioner does a remarkable job making my hair as soft and manageable as can be, to the point that any additional product just weighs it down. I never expected such results.\nI also tried a couple of the leave-in products, but they were too rich and heavy even for me. Those are probably better for real ethnic hair that has a different texture than mine, and perhaps for chemically processed hair (mine isn't and has never been. For the record, I don't even blow dry it). It's not that my hair got too greasy, but it lost some of the bounce in the open waves and the shine that the deep conditioning treatment gives it.\nThe products I tried smell soapy and herbal. The scent doesn't overwhelm or lingers too much, and, thankfully, it's not fruity like too many other hair products. All in all, I like the shampoo, love the deep conditioning treatment, but will have to skip the leave-in products.\nI received four free products for testing from Creme of Nature's PR. The products are available nationwide at a suggested retail price of $7.99- 9.99. For more details see their website.\nStill haven't finished the one from last week but have already started a couple of other books. My attention span is at an all-time low.\nRufus Wainwright- Movies of Myself (from his Want One album). A beautiful love song. Rufus is in my top ten artists. I love his voice and the mix of opera, pop and show tunes in his music. I saw him live on the last concert of his Release the Stars tour and wanted to take him home with me.\nA black knee-length skirt I bought in Paris a couple of years ago. It's a thick knit, stretchy that flares at the knee and fits perfectly. One of those versatile \"dress it up or down\" pieces that go with everything.\nI had a serious craving this week for Mazzolari Lui. Yes, the masculine version of the cuteness that is Lei. I needed the dirtier patchouli, so for three days straight I was helping myself to my husband's bottle. It's a beautiful scent from a great house that doesn't get as much attention as it deserves.\nGreen salad. Baby greens, soy nuts, dried apples, olive oil and fruit-infused balsamic.\nChocolate flavored black tea. Don't laugh. It's aromatic and very satisfying. Since I don't use sugar and only add a splash of skim milk, there's no guilt involved.\nI watched the first episode of The Real Housewives of NYC. Between being horrified of the show and of myself, I promptly added a season pass to my TiVo.\nAdjusting to daylight saving time. I love the concept (and the daylight) and would like it all year round with two extra hours for summer, but I'm going to feel jet-lagged for days.\nLike last week, still waiting for spring. I can't wait to see the first crocus.\nThis sexy little dress from Donna Karan's spring collection. I really liked the red one above, but it has pockets where no woman wants any extra volume, so I'll settle for the brown dress, probably without the belt. I'm too short to have something so wide cut me in the middle.\nWhat are your current loves?\nPart of my process when writing a perfume review is finding an image that captures it. Sometimes it's an art work, other times it's a scene from a movie (an old classic, because that's where my heart is). Unless I have a very specific idea right from the start, I google ideas, feelings, keywords until I find just the right one. Preparing to write about Incense Ros\u00e9, I didn't have to do any of that. The kaleidoscopic arabesque that's on the flyer that accompanies the bottle is perfectly evocative of this lovely scent.\nOh yes, if there was any doubt: I love Incense Ros\u00e9. A lot.\nJust as much as Incense Extreme is a stark, serious with the cleanest lines and notes, Ros\u00e9 is joyous and exuberant. Clementine and bergamot are not necessarily notes one would expect to find in an Andy Tauer creation. But what they do here is lend a sweet, radiating quality to the Tauerade base. They open rich and almost boozy and don't fully leave until very late into the dry-down, when the very pretty and streamlined rose takes their place, filling and illuminating the gaps between the darker, incensy parts.\nAs the scent develops, the familiar labdanum and ambergris that form the dry Tauerade emerge. They are spiced and prettified, making the perfume just a bit more feminine than what we're used to, though not girly or predictably femme. \nThe big surprise for me was deep and late into the dry-down. After the incense, labdanum, orris, cedar and ambergris calm down, I'm left with one of the most gorgeous myrrh notes I've smelled this side of Diptyque L'Eau Trois. And it lasts forever. Both in the air after I spray it and on my skin. It's still faintly there after a shower and demands serious scrubbing to make it go away.\nIncense Ros\u00e9 will be available at Scent Bar in L.A. and their online store Luckyscent starting March 29th. On that Saturday, Andy Tauer himself will make an appearance at the store (click the link to RSVP), to talk about his work and demonstrate some of the ingredients that go into the bottle. I met him last year at the launch of Reverie au Jardin, and can't recommend enough that if you're anywhere in the Los Angeles area, try to make it to the event. It's a rare opportunity to meet such an artist, and a lot of fun because Andy in person is as charming as he is on his blog.\nI'm often asked about the best way to try and learn about niche and artisan fragrances. My advice is to start with something extra wonderful that would change the way you think about perfume. This is definitely a great place to begin.\nI have a couple of samples to give away. Please leave a comment if you're interested.\nBonus entry if you can guess the reason behind the title of this post, Effulgent (obscure pop culture reference, nothing to do with perfume).\nThe sample I've been using, as well as the ones for the giveaway were sent to me by Andy. Samples and bottles of Incense Ros\u00e9 and the entire Tauer line are available in the US from Luckyscent ($90-$100). For European distributors, please see Tauer Perfumes website.\nImage: Desz\u00f6 B\u00f6di for Tauer Perfumes. To read more about the artist and this creation click here.\nAfter last week's TheBalm fiasco, we all deserve a concealer that actually delivers. Laura Geller liquid concealer in a pen with a plastic brush does the work wonderfully. Over the last month it has become my favorite little miracle. I'm using the one in Medium, but also did some testing on the Light, which was a bit too sheer for me. I actually considered buying both and blending them together, but eventually decided that Medium works perfectly by itself in terms of coverage, and the shade is exactly what I need.\nI put it on either on top of my regular foundation and blend them together, or, on a good skin day, I use it on bare face. One click of the pen usually dispenses more product than I actually need, so this is my only gripe here. I'd prefer if it came in a tube with a brush or even a sponge applicator. I use the brush to dot the concealer where I need it, and then spread and blend either with my finger or with a tiny concealer brush.\nThe creaseless wonder melts into the skin, covers everything it's supposed to and stays put for long hours (topped with some kind of powder product). I can't talk about hiding wrinkles, but it covers sun spots, blemishes (without caking on them!), redness on the sides of the nose and that pesky shade under the eyes. I only use it in that area on the darkest part, not the entire<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": ".\nNo reflection on B-man.\nIncense perfumes have piqued my interest because they signify a shift, but avoid the floral, oriental or gourmand territories. I have dabbled in knowing them better, but a vast territory remains unexplored.\nTo those of you more seasoned in the incense genre, what do you recommend as the best churchy, woody, dark and most...odd incense perfumes?\nEtro Shaal Nur was the first true incense I tried and I really liked it (and the Cockta smell it reminded me of).\nI'm not that familira with CdG incences but I'm pretty sure there will be others recommending those.\nWelcome to the world of incense Josephine! One of my favourite genres. I could quite literally list dozens, but if you want odd, very odd, (and very dank), I would say Messe de Minuit by Etro. For accessible and woody, you can't go far wrong with Cardinal by Heeley. As for churchy, there are a lot out there, but I think Avignon by CdG captures it well. A recent incense/rose/honey combo I dig is Cologne Pour le Soir by Francis Kurkdjian. As for as pure-as-you-can-get, try Incense Pure by Sonoma Scent Studio. Happy days!\nI second Cardinal and Abignon, but also suggest Annick Goutals Encens Flamboyant - it's a softer dreamier incense than the other two.\nYes, Encens Flamboyant is a good one. A few others have sprung to mind - Andy Tauer's Incense Rose, while Amouage have a whole host of incense-dominant fragrances, the Jubilations being stunning examples!\nAnother vote to Heeley Cardinal. It's soapy incense and it's wonderful.\nCDG Avignon, CDG Zagorsk, CDG Jaisalmer... they are not bad at all.\nEau d'Italie Baume du Doge is another favorite of mine, and I'm enjoying Kenzo Amour Le Parfum a lot, thanks to its lovely incense.\nCdG Avignon for frankincense for sure! I also love CdG Hinoki, but it's more woody than incensey. I also like Tauer Incense Rose in small doses. For myrrh I like Paestum Rose and the quiet Baume du Doge. Oh, and Abdes Salam Attar Mecca Balsam is lovely!\nI'm a diehard fan of Tauer's Incense Extr\u00e8me and Zagorsk, Balsamo della Mecca and I've heard very good things about Amouage Epic Woman. Like you, I've also rediscovered incense. Now, I don't know how I've lived so long without it!\nChurchy, woody, dark and most odd... Messe de Minuit!\nBut the latter is no churchy. Just woody, dark and very odd.\nTo all of my incense friends, thank you! These are wonderful suggestions and samples of all are forthcoming.\nI will report back on the outcome.\nIsa, welcome and thanks for your helpful comment!\nOn the fickle swirl of interests, and B-man's humorous but touching question: Clearly, he is the center of all orbits. There is only one love that needs to remain constant, and it seems it has for 25 years. :) Congrats to both of you.\nOn the perfume front, I'll tackle incense first. And mention one I ultimately can't wrangle myself, but feel compelled to point out: Diptyque L'Eau Trois. To my way of thinking, it's more like smudging an incense stick on you than a perfume based around incense. But some folks swear by it.\nOn a happier perfume front, a vote for something odd: SMN Nostalgia. Gasoline, pavement, leather. I think it totally calls the bet Bulgari Black made, and raises the stakes. This one, I enjoy.\nAm thinking about wood. Will get back to you on that. Meanwhile, enjoy your adventure!\nI like roses, but before I preferred not to wear rose scents. I like Une Rose Vermeille by Tauer, for example!\nHi SS - thanks for the kind comment.  Doesn't get better than that.\nI've already ordered a bunch of samples from Luckyscent and tried to order the Diptyque you mention. They carry everything BUT that.\nYou're right about Nostalgia. Trumps Bulgari Black in all the right ways...and much dirtier, which you know I love.\nWill look forward to your wood suggestions!\nVintage Lady, hello! Isn't it nice when you find a rose scent you love? Enjoy!\nAn unusual incense I would recommend is Flower by Kenzo Oriental. It is the Chinese variety, something called kyara, ie burnt agar wood, and it adds a dry, almost haunting dimension to this scent, whereas I don't care for regular Kenzo Flower, finding it too sweet and powdery, at least initially.\nOne of my favorite incense fragrances is a super cheap thrill - Encens Mystic by Crazylibellule and the Poppies.<|endoftext|>"

I want Tuberose which has notes listed of tuberose, white truffle, and musk. There is also Lilly of the Valley. These are adorable and retail for $35, a wonderful price point. They can be purchased at Modern Alchemy.\n2. Papier Poudre Powder Papers \u2013 These are mainly in my purse because I like the packaging (my review). I also like the old-fashioned powdery scent too. These papers were first introduced in 1907. These come in 3 shades. I use Rachel, but White is the most goth them all. These retail for under $4, making them perfect (fishnet) stocking stuffers \ud83d\ude42 Pick them up at B-Glowing.\n3. Diptyque John Galliano Room Spray \u2013 Mr. Haute Goth has a home fragrance! The packaiging makes this room spray worth it, Old English font and John Galliano\u2019s name. The scent is a pretty incense-woodsy blend with a hint of vanilla. It retails for $60 and is available at Space NK.\n4. Etro Messe de Minuit EDT \u2013 Not too long ago I wrote a review of this fragrance. It\u2019s cathedral-ish incense, so gothic to me. This is on my wish list. The 3.4 oz EDT retails for $155. It\u2019s available at Aedes.\n5. Archipelago Botanicals Leather Soy Candle \u2013 Candles provide such a mysterious ambiance. And the scent of this leather candle is quite mysterious with notes of animalic leather, amber, cashmere musk, and guaiacwood. The packaging is frosty black fitting in with any \u201cmacabre\u201d decor. This candle retails for $29.50 and is available at Candles Off Main.\n6. Villainess Soap in Villainess \u2013 I love Villainess Soap! I love their \u201csteampunk\u201d (lacking a better adjective at this time) aesthtic. There are so many wonderful scents to choose from, but I\u2019m suggesting the classic here. Villainess is described as \u201call ball gowns and combat boots\u201c. It\u2019s a smoky, leather scent with tons of heady florals. These bar soaps retail for $5 and can be bought at Gorey Details.\n7. Knockout Cosmetics Flatte Nail Polish in Ox \u2013 I keep featuring this in gift guides, but I think they make unique gifts. Ox is described as \u201cdried blood\u201d purple shade, a shade more unexpected than black. It has a matte finish. I love the Art Nouveau bottle. Knockout Nail Polish retails for $19 and is available at beauty.com.\n8. Lipstick Queen Lipstick in Black Tie Optional \u2013 What? An everyday black lipstick! Yes.  It also darkens other lipstick colors.  This retails for $18 and is available at Barney\u2019s.\n9. Tarina Tarantino Sparklcity Eyeshadow \u2013 This eyeshadow is featured in this list for packaging only. It\u2019s awesome! I love the ivory style skull cameo vintage brooch packaging! Inside are 5 neutral shimmery shadows. Everyone needs neutrals, right? This is limited edition and retails for $39 at Sephora.\n10. Ayala Moriel Poison Ring & Solid Perfume \u2013 This is an awesome product with so many to choose from. The one shown is an example of a tiger\u2019s eye poison ring. That just sounds goth, right? Inside the poison ring is a luxurious natural solid perfume inspired by the style of the ring. I like the sound of Espionage, a smoky leather, and Razala, an Arabian inspired oud floral. These are custom and prices range from $55-$180 depending on the ring, etc. These are available at Ayala Moriel.\nExcellent choices! I have two of the D.L & Co pocketwatches, Jasmine Sambac (my fave) and Tuberose. They really do make the perfect gift, but I wasn\u2019t able to give either of mine away (as I\u2019d originally intended to do, at least for one).\nYou have them? OK, I\u2019ve been talked into buying both for myself \ud83d\ude42 I love solids and I can\u2019t resist the packaging. A couple of years ago I bought the Roll-Ons which I thought would of smelled better in a solid base!\nOooh, I was just lusting over YSL\u2019s black gloss (Noir Laque 992). I\u2019ll have to check out Lipstick Queen.\nOh, that YSL black gloss is awesome! I mean the packaging alone is amazing! The Lipstick Queen black is pretty, less shiny than the YSL obviously.\nI want them all! Thank you for posting this guide!<|endoftext|>"

Two of the most important names in the fragrance industry have, for our greatest pleasure, opened their new boutique in London. Besides the coming back of the House of Creed in the luxurious Mayfair, and the launch of diptyque Paris in the trendy Shoreditch, both openings have introduced to the scent\u2019s world new incredible fragrances.\nWalking in the new House of Creed is like being wrapped in a warm blanket of exotic scent. Creed being without any doubt one of the great homes of fragrances since 1760, imagine our excitement to see its doors reopen in the heart of London!\nIndeed, being away since 1854, this autumn the House of Creed is finally coming back to its roots. Located in Mayfair, 99 Mount Street to be exact, the boutique perfectly embodies the brand\u2019s mantra: tradition and modernity. Designed by architect Can Onaner, the luxurious new House of Creed exhibits its wide range of fragrances across two floors, allowing costumers to fully experience seven generations of innovation and technique.\nThe Royal Mayfair fragrance is the perfect combination between complexity and delicacy. With its notes of British Gin and Scottish Highland Pine, the perfume is made for stylish British gentlemen. Reflecting Creed\u2019s traditional techniques yet responding to modernity, Royal Mayfair honors the passionate life that the iconic Duke of Windsor ones lived.\nElegant and powerful, Royal Princess Oud is an enchanting scent for the most fashionable women. Inspired by Creed\u2019s family history, back when the name was famous for its fine tailoring, the fragrance celebrates this meaningful heritage. The meticulous composition of sweet and flowery notes, creates a delightful scent wearable day and night.\nOn the 2nd of September, the arty Shoreditch saw the birth of diptyque\u2019s ingenious pop-up store in Boxpark. Jubilant and colourful, with rainbow flowers coming down the ceilings, the boutique screams innovation. Very different from all other diptyque stores, it offers the brand\u2019s best selling products, making luxury accessible to all perfume lovers.\nOpon\u00e9: Created by the talented Olivia Giacobetti, the flowery and spicy fragrance reflects the warm Somalian weather. Indeed the perfume reveals the enchanting stories, and the smells, of its ancient port.\nBenjoin Boh\u00e8me: After 5 years of experimentations and research, Olivier Pescheux and Myriam Badault created this exclusive fragrance. Resonating to its Laotian\u2019s essence, Benjoin Boh\u00e8me\u2019s peculiar smell will wrap you in a chic balm of delightful scent.\nEau Mage : This innovative fragrance fully symbolizes diptyque\u2019s 34 collection, diverging with anything that the brand has done before! The combination of citrusy and spicy notes creates a powerful scent for both men and women.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "This spring is promising to be rose scented. Every other flanker, a sequel to the original big launch, seems to be reinvented in rose tinted prettiness. From Kenzo to Cartier, every house has been thinking pink. Flankers are not known for being daring, and when I dutifully smelled through the whole lot, I felt that I was smelling the same perfume over and over again. Fruity, sparkling, instantly forgettable. In the end, I picked six fragrances that stood out, although you will see that in some cases this is an underhanded compliment.\nWhy bother then? Most of these fragrances will not appeal to perfume lovers used to the opulence of florals or the tinge of animalic notes hidden among the fleshy petals. By contrast, all six rose perfumes I\u2019ve selected are clean and dewy. Some of them are better than others, but overall, this selection contains nice options for anyone who prefers their florals fresh and sparkling, without the cloying sweetness that\u2019s a common theme in most feminine new launches. Simple and pretty are not negative qualities, and occasionally, this is exactly what hits the spot.\nToday, I\u2019m reviewing three fragrances that pair rose with white florals: Valentino Valentina Acqua Floreale; Kenzo Amour I Love You; and Juicy Couture La La. The white florals, be it tuberose or gardenia, have a creamy sweetness that contrast well with a sheer, citrusy rose accord.\nValentina Acqua Floreale follows in the footsteps of its older sister, Valentina. The bubble gum tuberose of the original is sheered out, made less cloying and thick. It reminded me of a milder Juicy Couture. The vibrant start of citrus and orange blossom fades to a soft, musky drydown that goes by the \u201csexy clean\u201d moniker in fragrance houses. On the other hand, Valentina Acqua Floreale is so perfectly well-behaved and inoffensive that I doubt one can have a strong opinion about it. It\u2019s radiant, sheer and coy. It would make a sophisticated fragrance for a teenage girl. While it\u2019s not a drama queen, it\u2019s a good quality perfume, with smooth development and decent longevity.\nKenzo Amour was a milky rice fragrance with a touch of frangipani, but it didn\u2019t sell as well as Kenzo hoped. The fruity and tart flanker Kenzo Amour Indian Holi was an unexpected success, which landed the rest of the Amour flankers in the same fizzy and lighthearted register.\nOut of the 6 fragrances I am reviewing this week, I Love You is the one I would wear myself. It banks its success on the commercial combination of red berries, fresh roses and tuberose, but it\u2019s well-crafted at all stages. The sparkling top notes of grapefruit and red currants are tart and mouthwatering, serving as a pleasant contrast to the sweet floral heart. The bright spicy accent is a nice embellishment. While the drydown of soft musks and sheer vanilla is nothing new, I Love You smells polished and pretty.\nJuicy Couture wanted a fragrance that was \u201ca little punk rock, a lot of free spirit,\u201d and the result is a by-the-book white floral with a touch of rose. I\u2019m missing the punk rock bit entirely, and my impressions are mixed. On the one hand, Juicy Couture La La has a terrific start of dewy rose and tuberose. Jazzed up with sweet citrus, it feels effervescent and reminds me of Clinique Happy. But then everything fades to a sour, high-pitched floral, which lasts far longer than you want it to. The money clearly went into the packaging, because the heavy glass bottle with is eye-catching.\nValentino and Juicy Couture perfumes are available at department stores, while Kenzo is a limited edition duty-free (travel retail) launch.\nSample: Valentino and Kenzo are my own acquisitions; Juicy Couture\u2013PR.\nSarah: Hmm. Might give them a miss unless I win the draw for la la of course :). Thank you for smelling them for us!\nAndrea: On a perfume review site, someone had chosen Valentino as similar to Kenzo ILY. I already own this, but it ended up having a somewhat sour note that was off-putting. Possibly the Pomelo.\nDo you know off-hand whether or not ILY is the same type of scent? I do like a lighter rose sometimes, particularly with some citrus\u2026 So far, Diptyque seems to be the best choice, but I also like Yuzu Rouge. Is this in a similar vein?\nVictoria: Valentino Acqua Floreale, you mean? Or something else?\nAndrea: I was trying to remember that one! Yes, I like them both. I have the Valentino perfume, not to be confused with Valentino<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Valentine's Day rolled round this year and was fairly uneventful for me as per usual, what with the fact that the other half always works nights at weekends. One of the highlights for me though is the annual Diptyque celebration of love, which I held off burning until recently because I was scared of ruining that beautiful white wax candle. And seeing my money evaporate away into the ether.\nMy thoughts on the candle: so prettyyyyyyyy!! Both the box and the jar itself are gorgeous, with an ivy and rose motif printed all over. It's a much more vibrant look than last year's Rosa Mundi offering, which I absolutely adored and obsessed over. The print gives away a lot about the smell, a greener and fresher take on the standard Rose scent.\nThe only thing is, I have not one, but two problems with this candle. Firstly, the jar feels so thin and fragile, compared to the usual jars Diptyque come in. Dare I say it, it feels....cheap, almost as if they used up the budget on each candle on the print and cut corners on the jar. Secondly, the throw. The throw is terrible in my opinion. I live in a dinky flat and could barely smell the candle the first time I burnt it, only noticing it when I walked next to it. The second time there was some improvement, but barely. If I'm spending \u00a340 plus on a candle, I want to be smacked in the face with the smell and left with my jaw on the ground, not daring myself to see how close to a naked flame I can put my face just to get some perfume scented highs.\nSo, my thoughts overall? A pretty and pleasant enough candle, but am I keen to go and buy a spare before it's too late? No, I think I'll be saving those pennies, and try to avoid sending them off into the ether with the smoke.<|endoftext|>"

She describes the phases of fall as only a perfumer would \u2014 starting with a top note (that holding-onto-summer vibe) and finishing with a strong base (woody notes that call to mind a crackling fire).\nAs the season progresses, Nurislamova suggests moving into a cozier scent. \u201cThe heart of fall can also be described as warm, taking on the comforting definition of the word,\u201d she says; citing clean cotton, amber, and coffee as some of her favorite notes. Cartier\u2019s Les Heures Voyageuses Oud & Menthe Parfum fuses amber and mint for a fresh feel, while Kintsugi by Masque Milano mixes top notes of amber with a base of sweet vanilla. Or, layer on the scent of leather (and a hint of lotus) care of Leather Eau de Parfum by Malin + Goetz. \u201cThink of it as your warm leather jacket on a crisp fall day, but in scent form,\u201d the brand said in a press release.\n\u201cDry, charred woods, mulled spices, and hints of smoke define the season's end, evoking the images and crackling sounds of the first campfire of the year,\u201d Nurislamova says. This is where fall's new releases really shine. Rum, clove, and cinnamon define Dior\u2019s aptly-named Spice Blend Eau de Parfum; Atelier Cologne's Patchouli Riviera Cologne Absolue boasts bold Indonesian patchouli; and Heretic Parfum's forthcoming Dirty Violet is grounded in sandalwood. But perhaps the epitome of this end-of-autumn feeling is Celine\u2019s Bois Dormant, the fashion house\u2019s first foray into fragrance. It smells like \u201cthe smoke of burning wood, the fir tree in the winter cold,\u201d as Chandler Burr wrote in a Wall Street Journal article on the scent's forthcoming launch.\nAhead, 14 fall fragrances to capture every moment of the season ahead.\nBibliophiles, stand up: The newest REPLICA scent transports you to your favorite reading nook, care of the cedarwood, patchouli, and vanilla absolute notes.

Consider that feeling effectively bottled with Chlo\u00e9 L\u2019Eau, launching Sept. 1.\nCome Nov. 5, Heretic Parfum will release its next \"dirty\" scent: Dirty Violet. \"Violets are floral, woody, and powdery all at once, making Dirty Violet a particularly elusive fragrance that refuses to be defined,\" the brand says in a press release. The top note is blended with patchouli (at the heart) and sandalwood (at the base) for an extra dose of warmth.\nIn a WSJ interview, Hedi Slimane, the creative director for Celine, says this scent is \u201clike the library of a Parisian h\u00f4tel particulier from the 18th century.\u201d Which, yes, please. It launches in October.\nLaunching in October at Nordstrom, Atelier Cologne's Patchouli Riviera \"has more than a 95% level of ingredients of natural origin,\" the brand says in a press release. You'll find patchouli from Indonesia, pomelo from Italy, and pink pepper from the Indian Ocean.\nLeather Eau de Parfum was inspired by the sensation of slipping into a vintage leather jacket \u2014 preferably, a soft, worn-in version from the '70s \u2014 on the first chilly day of fall.\nFall is synonymous with spice \u2014 ginger, cinnamon, pumpkin \u2014 and Dior's latest is the perfect blend of (almost) all of them. Spritz for a serving of cinnamon, ginger, black pepper, coriander, and nutmeg.\n\"September smells like Wild Vanilla Orchid for Floral Street,\" Feeney tells TZR. \"As the seasons change, Wild Vanilla Orchid embraces with wrap of vanilla and a soothing blend of warm, sweet, exotic ambroxan and cashmeran. It is like snuggling up in a warm blanket, whilst being uplifted with lemon, cassis and bamboo.\"\nNotes of mint and wood come together with a hint of sugar in Cartier's Les Heures Voyageuses Oud & Menthe Parfum. The effect? A fresh, warm scent that's just sweet enough.\nDescribed by the brand as a \"musky floral,\" Id\u00f4le was created by three female perfumers who aimed to capture the essence of femininity without resorting to tired tropes. The resulting mix features clean, crisp fruits and florals \u2014 and artfully side-steps the stereotypical, candy-sweet smell of traditionally \"feminine\" perfumes.\nDiptyque's just-launched \"perfumed bracelet,\" infused with warm sandalwood, is the subtlest (and coolest) way to wear fragrance this fall.\nThis unisex fragrance from Masque Milano features citrus-y bergamot, warm amber, and a finishing note of benzoin siam (a super-luxe vanilla).<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " not find anywhere else. What they look for above all else is the richness of the range of scents, the originality of the fragrances, products with a strong personality, as well as innovative products, especially for home and products with a personal and emotional approach.\nTell us about the exclusive launch for the Middle East?\nAt Diptyque we have a saying, \u201cPerfume is an art and art is a journey.\u201d Indeed, travel has always been at the heart of creativity at Diptyque. The Maison\u2019s three founders travelled the world. From 1961, as they were establishing their store at 34 boulevard Saint-Germain, Yves Coueslant, Desmond Knox-Leet and Christiane Gautrot made their way to the Middle East. Theirs was a road trip by car, by coach and on horseback through the many landscapes of the region, at the time untouched by tourism. From Damascus, the city of jasmine, to Trabzon, via Palmyra, Aleppo or Baalbek, in search of scents, colours and wonders, they discovered a land of rich olfactory facets.\nToday, for its 60th birthday, Diptyque celebrates this same borderless territory with the launch of Eau Rihla, a new Eau de Parfum. The name Eau Rihla is an invitation to travel. It was inspired by Ibn Ba\u1e6d\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6da, a Berber born in the 14th century \u2013 a great explorer who travelled nearly 120,000 kilometres during his lifetime. His memories are gathered in a book titled Rihla. By extension, rihla now refers to a genre of Arabic literature: travel narratives. This, once again, calls to mind Diptyque\u2019s roots, as Desmond Knox-Leet used to fill his leather notebooks with notes and sketches to preserve the memories of his past adventures. Eau Rihla is thus a name that resonates as an invitation to travel along the routes of the Middle East.\nThis olfactory journey, through memories gleaned along the routes of the Middle East, lies at the heart of the inspiration for the creation of Eau Rihla. The new eau de parfum is the olfactory recounting of a long journey where every scent encountered leaves its mark. Leather, inspired by Desmond\u2019s notebooks or by travel trunks, plays a major role in the composition. Fabrice Pellegrin created exclusively for Diptyque a leather note to be used in Eau Rihla. Obtained from Chinese cedarwood, it is a natural ingredient with a leathery scent. Named \u201ccedrocuir\u201d, it is a \u201cvegetal\u201d leather with velvety and sensual facets.\nHow would you say the GCC region is different from others in terms of fragrance?\nThe Middle East market has grown to become a reference in the industry of fragrance, and even a vitrine, inspiring the world with their taste and take on niche perfumery. At Diptyque, we have always remained close to the Middle Eastern fragrance culture, since our founders were as well always very much connected to that side of the world. Their appreciation of the GCC region led them to create some of the world top-selling fragrances such as Tam Dao, Oud Paolo or Volutes to name but a few.\nThe GCC region always amazed us with their precise knowledge of fragrances, scents and ingredients. They can easily connect and accept to be transported where the fragrance takes them. For there aren\u2019t any limitations when it comes to the power of fragrances and what it can trigger in terms of inspirations. This market has a deep understanding of the world of fragrance and its subtlety, and it is very inspiring to watch. Creating Eau Rihla \u2013 our new exclusive fragrance for the Middle East \u2013 is naturally a result of the connection we always want to keep nurturing with the Middle East.\nWhich Diptyque\u2019s fragrance consistently drives sales?\nDo Son, Tempo, Oud Paolo, Fleur de Peau, Eau Duelle and Eau Capitale are particularly appreciated in the Middle East region.\nWhat is your goal for Diptyque this year?\nDiptyque\u2019s 60th anniversary in 2021 is the opportunity to celebrate, all through the year, that which has driven the Maison since its creation, that which symbolises the Diptyque spirit and the appropriate moment to bring to life five themes that are particularly dear to the Maison \u2013 a passion for graphic design, which was the first highlight of the year; actually, the encounter as a catalyst for creativity; nature, particularly in the Mediterranean, as a source of inspiration \u2013 to be revealed this summer; travel as an entryway into the cultures of the world; and finally curiosity, which is not a fault but something to be treasured.\nWhat do you envision for the future of Diptyque?\nWe envision and hope to continue attracting people from around the world, and look forward to continue creating with passion. This is, for us, the most important. But in order to create, we also need to give it meaning and offer a product that takes into account consideration the evolution of the world by becoming more and more eco-responsible. At Diptyque, more than ever, we are very sensitive to the subject of sustainability which is of course in the heart of creation for many years.<|endoftext|>"

When I learned that he left for New York, I was not at all surprised. I thought that she finally went to an environment that suited her perfectly. I learned from mutual friends her news and her collaborations in the glorious era of fashion and showbiz, when all this sounded like a fairy tale to us in Greece.\nA few years ago I met her at a fellow students and I was surprised. \u201cI\u2019m back,\u201d he told me. \u201cI want to be close to my family.\u201d As time went on and we talked, she seemed even more beautiful than before, more organized, uncomplicated, a woman full of experiences from New York, willing and with good humor to share them with her friends.\nAfter studying at the American College, Christina continued at the Parsons School of Design in New York and then at Warwick University in England. At the same time, she worked for the American ELLE and the Greek VOGUE. He has collaborated with world-renowned designers such as DKNY, Vera Wang and many others..\n-Christina, you are one of the designers who started your company in the Greek market of costume made jewelry during the crisis. How difficult was that?\n-When I went to the tax office to get started, the tax collector asked me three times if I was sure!\nIt was quite difficult. Everyone else said so, but this new venture did not seem so impossible to me because in the crisis there are opportunities, you just have to dare it and try with passion and vigor.\n-Tell us about the plans of your winter collection and your fortunes for 2021.\n-For winter 2020 \u2013 21 in my designs I have used a lot of metal. My charms are gilded and silver-plated mainly with emphasis on archaic designs and geometric shapes in simple lines and special curves.\n-Where can someone buy your jewelry?\n-My creations can be bought in various stores throughout Greece as well as in some foreign countries. At the same time, one can contact me via Instagram, facebook or e-mail.\n-You have lived and worked in New York for major and well-known fashion magazines. Would you like to describe your work routine there?\n-I will talk to you about the American ELLE, for which I worked in New York.\nOne day was not the same as the other. Some days we made stories that had the same concept and collected many different accessories from well-known designers for this purpose.\nOther times we went to amazing studios in Manhattan to take photos with famous models. I typically remember one of these studios was in front of the Hudson river and had an elevator that could fit in a small van!\nDuring the photo shoot, they had exactly what we needed from lights and equipment as well as incredible pastries, coffee, tea and the rest from well-known delicatessens.\nAnother time I remember I went to the Diamond district in downtown Manhattan to get diamonds and take them to a studio in Brooklyn, where we photographed them. This was a bit stressful because I was responsible for them, which of course we returned immediately after the photo shoot!\nThe security doors of the wholesale shops, from where we borrowed them, were over 20 cm thick!\n\u2013 You also made celebrity P.R. in N.Y. Who did you work for?\n-I have worked for Mickey Rourke\u2019s publicist and therefore for Mickey himself! Specifically when he was nominated for the movie the Wrestler. We then won five awards. We made the image for him, we helped him in the interviews and much more. I often went to his house to carry various documents, to leave the clothes and everything he needed.\nTo me Mickey is a great actor and at the same time an incredible boxer. I felt more familiar with him because I also do boxing, the truth is.\n-Would you like to tell us some well-known names of the American and British show biz that you had intercourse with?\n-I have met several celebrities in various places in New York. Some of them are Black eyed peas singer Fergie, Victoria Beckham, David Beckham, Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta Jones, several famous models, Betty Middler, famous designers such as DVF, DKNY and many others.\nMersedesBenz\u2019sFashionWeek and other shows. You have contributed to these events.\n-I started going to the American fashionweek when I was working for the American ELLEaccessories.\nFor two seasons I also helped WsIntern in organizing these producers. The experience I gained was unique.\nMy favorite moment was when I was working next to VeraWang with the productionhouseKCD for one of its shows.\n-When I returned to Greece and I was received with love in Greek Vogue, my colleagues were surprised when I asked them where their \u201cwardrobe\u201d is.\nThe \u201cwardrobe\u201d in a magazine is the room, which houses all the clothes and accessories from well-known designers. These are borrowed by each magazine so that it can use them in the photos and then of course returns them.\nIn the Greek vogue, the closet was in the basement, next to the parking lot in a room that did not even have painted walls, even though the rest of the building was state of the art.\nThis was a small shock to me. I was used to it from American ELLE and American Vogue, where I was lucky enough to be at some point, as well as from Harpers Bazaar, where I remember his closet was on the 26th floor, in a glass skyscraper overlooking all of Manhattan. when choosing clothes and accessories.\n-I did promotional modeling for Burberry and I was promoting the then new perfume the Bit, in the Macys store.\nEvery time I left work and went to Subway to go home and always a random passenger asked me what perfume I was wearing. As you can understand, \u201cI was bathed in the perfume\u201d and he really liked it.\n-You have a strong Instagram at CWILHELMINA and you are an influencer in big companies.\n-After 10 years of building my instagram profile, I now work with large companies such as DKNY, Mac, Attika, Adidas, Fila, Diptyque, Laura Mercier and other well-known companies.\n-How difficult is it to build a serious professional Instagram? Can anyone consult you? Are there reliable applications that transform in a natural way?\n-I think that if someone is really interested in creating a proper professional account, he should take lessons because there are so many things he does not know. Of course there are several applications that help you in many different places to build a proper profile. Some of them are Later, Canvas, Facetune etc and if you are in the mood you can experiment.\n-What is your opinion about Tik-Tok?\n-I personally love Tik-Tok. It started to become famous teenagers, but at the moment it has evolved into many other age groups.\nThe point is to understand at Tik-Tokot that you have to choose a niche market and deal with it.\nMany companies are currently spending large sums of money on Tik-Tok to promote their products while also earning a lot of money. It has helped small businesses as well as large multinationals increase their profits.\n-You have worked in colleges in Greece for fashion marketing and you do seminars in big companies with this subject.\nA unique experience to teach young and older people who have an appetite to learn new things that help them in their lives.\n-Special moments from your student years at Deree?\nWhat should I remember? The wonderful events that we organize in the marketing society or in the Advertising Special group? The laughter in the corridors, the wonderful conferences with professors and executives of big companies that gave us the lights for our later career.\n-Writers for American travel sites for luxuryhotels. How did this come about?\n-I review very good hotels, I visit them and then I write about them evaluating their services, buildings, staff, service and much more.\nThe owner of this site had met me by chance because I was a close friend of his editor-in-chief at American Fashion Week and he had suggested it to me since I lived in New York and so I started.\n-Do you prefer life in Greece or would you like to have stayed in New York?\n-I think I will upset the Greek readers because I will choose New York!\nNew York is a city where you evolve every second. It gives you incredible opportunities and mainly the capable and the one who has passion for his object moves forward and not the one who knows someone, as is usual in Greece.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Spring is in the air and our highly developed sense of smell is embracing the various aromas of the most alluring season. The intrinsic connection between scent and brain allow us to evoke emotions, change our mood and awake subconscious memories. Pleasant smells activate certain brain cells which send a positive response through our nervous system. On the other hand, unpleasant ones, cause feelings of stress and anger. Studies show that people living in slums, enveloped by filth and decay, lose their sense of smell and taste due to the overpowering surroundings. How lucky are we? This is the season of fragrance, let\u2019s celebrate with the latest in perfume, scented oils, candles and aromatic skincare.\nNoble VII Cosmos Flower from Clive Christian, L\u2019Ombre dans l\u2019Eau de Parfum from Diptyque and Cashmere Aqua from Donna Karan.\nSince its birth, perfume has become a symbol of power only accessible to the royals and the upper class. The rich concentrated liquid gold was synonym of wealth, class, hierarchy and made those who possessed it highly desirable. It\u2019s believed that perfume played an essential role in politics at courts and lords manipulated meetings by bringing seductive smelling wives, daughters, and courtesans into the halls. To this day, passion and seduction are at the root of perfume, and makers like Clive Christian know it. He designed an empire of fragrances inspired by British royalty and Noble VII Cosmos Flower is one his latest. Infused with bittersweet cocoa, jasmine and plum, this scent is sophistication in a bottle. Another masterful scent directly from the French court is L\u2019Ombre dans I\u2019Eau de Parfum from Diptyque. The delicate blackcurrant leaves and Bulgarian rose notes present in this perfume dress your senses with pure elegance. Donna Karan\u2019s Cashmere Aqua is a light, fresh scent perfect for women in love with a rich, but delicate aromas.\nGreylocke from Phlur, Enchanted Wish from Mary Kay and Princess of Hearts from Vera Wang.\nThe scent inspired by America\u2019s royal family, The Kennedys, is Greylocke from Phlur which mixes, sea salt, bergamot, birch leaf, silver Vetiver and pine resin to create one of their signature fragrances. Mary Kay\u2019s Spring fragrance Enchanted Wish infuses granny Smith apple, orange oil, stargazer lily, peony, brown sugar, warm amber, and illuminating musk to create this delightful new scent. Vera Wang\u2019s Princess of Hearts is as whimsical as its name and incorporates notes of wild strawberry, creamy musk, watermelon, lily, bergamot and cedarwood.\nThe Ritual of Sakura from Rituals, Herbal Bath Oils from Kneipp and Exquisite Vanilla & Violet Flower Bath Shower Gel and Body Lotion from Molton Brown.\nAs we dive into a more holistic lifestyle, more people are leaving behind chemically infused products and are embracing a more natural approach. Brands are relying on mother nature to enhance their formulas and instead of using scientifically developed scents, they are incorporating the whole plant. The results are wholesome products with active ingredients that have an effect on our skin and emotions. Healing through scent is no longer something exclusive of the very few living an organic lifestyle, but fortunately for all. The Ritual of Sakura from Rituals applies the refreshing and nourishing benefits of Asian rice milk and cherry blossoms on your skin. Kneipp is a mostly vegan German brand that infuses only natural ingredients in their products. Their Herbal Bath Oils were created to calm your nerves, relax your muscles, open your sinus and relieve tension with one bath at a time. Molton Brown just released their The Patisserie Parlour Collection where the Exquisite Vanilla & Violet Flower Bath Shower Gel & Body Lotion blends violet flower, freesia and vanilla extract to create this deeply moisturizing formula.\nPomegranate Noir Scent Surround Diffuser from Jo Malone, The Hourglass Diffuser from Diptyque, and Carthusia Mediterraneo Home Diffuser from Bigelow Chemists.\nThe Ritual of Sakura Scented Candle from Rituals, Baies 3 Wick Candle from Diptyque, Exquisite Vanilla & Violet Flower Scented Candle from Molton Brown.\nThe sensual experience is not complete without reaching the home where scented candles and diffusers are the masters. The Hourglass Diffuser or Le Sablier from Diptique applies the latest technology of cold diffusion in which the scented oils are not heated, but kept at the right temperature to trigger evaporation and fragrance release. This beauty will be available in May, just in time for Mother\u2019s Day. Another contender is Carthusia Mediterraneo Home Diffuser from Bigelow Chemists, which fills your home with rich Mediterranean floral and citrus scents. If you\u2019re a candle lover, you can also enjoy the stunning aroma of The Ritual of Sakura and the Exquisite Vanilla & Violet Flower Scented Candle from Molton Brown. To top it all, the sophisticated black Baies 3 Wick Candle from Diptyque will make difficult leaving your sweet scented chambers.<|endoftext|>"

The realness of Madison's mermaid tail and the sweet story of the nice guy who was helping her really captured my imagination. Funny, how almost 30 years later I am kind of re-enacting my first favorite movie. A mermaid in New York. My favorite movie of all time happens to be New York centered as well, When Harry Met Sally. It is about time for my annual re-watching of that movie....\nMy passion for traveling slowly developed. My first flight in an airplane was at 19 to Cleveland, Ohio to meet Adam's family in Strongsville. Despite the great gift of getting bumped to first class, I was still pretty miserable with nerves. A few more flights were notched onto my belt via Vegas a couple of times and then St. Louis a couple of times; I eventually learned how to keep myself calm. It involved deep breaths and hand sewing. Traveling began to excite me. I wanted to taste different foods, view different scenery, take it in with all my senses. Very soon here I will be experiencing New York with my dear NaLonda for a weekend. I wanted to share my itinerary with you all for fun, and if you have any input please comment!\nWe fly in early in the morning and have two and a half days to explore the Big Apple. After much searching one night on the couch together, we settled on the Archer Hotel. It is brand new and the rooms, though small, look luxurious. The staff seem really friendly on the phone the couple of times I called. (Newbie here wanted to make sure we could drop our luggage off at the hotel upon arrival- >shrug< I wasn't sure! But we can). My first cuppa Joe from a Nespresso machine in our room ridiculously excites me, as well as the turn down service. It is located in the Garment District near Times Square and Broadway with a view of the Empire State Building.\nUpon relieving ourselves of luggage we plan on shopping (Macy's, Barney's, Tiffany's, and hopefully a few perfume shops like Diptyque, Malle and Killian's), walking and oooohing and aahhhhing until lunch time. Lunch was picked to be Pizza by Certe' by NaLonda. Seriously, how good does this pie sound?!\nAfter lunch we will be moseying about again until we hit up the Museum of Modern Art.\nPost museum experience brings us to dinner. Reservations at Betony were made tout de suite once the bookings were opened for reservations for our time slot of choice. Betony has great reviews and has earned its first Michelin star rating. I have never dined at a Michelin star rated restaurant and I am over the moon excited to do so.\nThe following day will dawn bright and early with a trip to the tip top of the Statue of Liberty, the world's largest weeping angel. I won't blink. After hiking it up all those stairs we will lunch at Serendipity 3 for a burger and their famous Frrrozen Hot Chocolate.\nWith bellies full of chocolate wonderfulness we will take in a Broadway show or play. We are not sure yet as to what. In order to stretch our funds, I decided to get our tickets the day of at a TKTS booth in Time Square. After the show we are headed to Chinatown.\nIn Chinatown, we made reservations at Oriental Garden for our first Dim Sum experience. The evenings may take us to walk the Brooklyn Bridge or hang about in Times Square.\nSunday morning I am talking NaLonda into hitting up Russ & Daughters for the best bagel and lox in the city, recommended by my friend, before we depart at midday.\nI have my heart set on one souvenir for sure. A Serge Luten's bell jar perfume. NYC Barney's is the only place in the U.S. that stocks them. I am thinking about Muscs Koublai Khan (enchanting musk)or Fille en Aiguilles (sweet pine needles). I adore both but must only choose one.\nSo what do you think? We have some free time stuffed in there in random places but we are trying to get as much in as we can for a two day trip.

So it may seem that I\u2019m biased, but his fragrances are all very well-done. I\u2019ve tried samples of all of them. But The Soft Lawn is my favourite.\nI\u2019ll be going to their new stockist (Roulier White) in London at the end of this month so I\u2019ll be sure to try a few, but particularly The Soft Lawn. Many thanks for the recommendation.\nNow, as soon as Spring arrives The Dandy is to be found rather too often for some people\u2019s liking in green. It is perhaps, with chypre and cuir, my most favourite of the groups.\nGuerlain\u2019s Chamade as an example of an aldehydic green, of which the equally classic Ma Griffe is another (rather wonderfully renovated of late). Diptyque\u2019s Ombre dans l\u2019Eau for huge cassis and Balmain\u2019s de Balmain for the pairing of cassis leaf with galbanum to quite extraordinary effect. The abstraction of Piguet\u2019s amorphous Futur is a scary wonder and Jacomo\u2019s Silences set a No. 19 like accord across an intense muguet opening to startling three act effect. Finally, for something utterly contemporary Cartier\u2019s Baiser Vole is that house\u2019s best release in years and something of an instant masterpiece.\nSuggestions only for someone a little too familiar with this hue.\nLovely to see you and thanks for all those wonderful and much appreciated suggestons.\nChamade was on offer at the evening but we didn\u2019t get to talk about it. The Diptyque has a lot of fans and Futur does sound intriguing. Baiser Vole is really well done and a great bottle too.\nFunnily enough I just ordered a bottle of Silences. I hope I love it and am pleased to hear that you admire it. It\u2019s certainly going cheap.\nI do hope you like Silences. it has gone through a few iteration. I\u2019ve never come cross a bad one, though some say there are a few rather pale and limey ones out there. The EdPs as a rule seem to be better.\nBaiser Vole, is interesting as I wonder having worn it again today how green it is beyond the opening, an interesting, very well made perfume that deserves the attention it seems to be getting.\nI\u2019m very much enjoying Silences thanks and hope to review it soon. According to Bois de Jasmine it\u2019s now been reformulated again and sold under the name Sublime so I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve got a bottle. I\u2019ll have to check the concentration.<|endoftext|>"

Designed by Ricky Jackson of Ricky Paul Flowers, the tree recalls the opulence of the 18th Century royal court, echoing the artistic fascination for \u201cChinoiserie\u201d, the aristocratic fashion of the time.\nThe 10th anniversary tree at the iconic Mayfair hotel was bound to be one of the capital\u2019s best. This year\u2019s did not disappoint, having been created by the hotel\u2019s longtime friend and guest, designer Christian Louboutin. Adorned with red and gold baubles, dusted with shimmering snow and sporting a golden crown, the 5m tree stands in a wintry forest clearing. It\u2019s joined by the bright-red Loubi Express, an intimate dining carriage offering champagne, cocktails and classic Claridge\u2019s canap\u00e9s.\nA maximalist riot of twinkly tinsel, vintage baubles and colourful bows, topped off by a golden galleon, the resplendent 20-foot tree almost touches the ceiling of the hotel\u2019s Georgian lobby. Titled A Christmas Dream, it was dressed by British artist and designer Luke Edward Hall, who also added giant cut-outs of his signature illustrations. For the perfect canvas to Hall\u2019s playful decorations, Antwerp-based florist Mark Colle fashioned a six-metre structure covered with fresh pine greens.\nUnconventional but no less stunning for it, the iconic department store\u2019s Tree of Liberty comes to life in jewel-bright tones of teal and pink, and is visible from every floor (due to sheer size, it was created in three parts). Taking inspiration from an ancient Tree of Life motif, the installation was hand-carved by artists and features reindeer moss and cloud-like bunches of blossom, coloured with natural dyes.\nAward-winning Scottish designer Holly Fulton is the star behind Aqua Shard\u2019s festive display, the intricate DecoDance. Stylish champage-holding figures balance on large, scarlet Christmas gifts, capturing the spirit, glamour and decadence of the glittering \u2018Roaring Twenties\u2019 era. The installation is topped off by a huge bow, dwarfing the ladies at a height of six metres above ground.\nSt Pancras always gives a good tree \u2013 this year\u2019s sparkly centrepiece, in partnership with Lanc\u00f4me, is inspired by Paris\u2019 most iconic landmark. The 36-foot tower is adorned with over 1,500 glittering bottles of the brand\u2019s signature fragrance, \u2018La Vie Est Belle\u2019. Like its full-size French counterpart, the installation also features a magical light show, visible almost 600 times during the tree\u2019s tenure at the station.\nPossibly the best-smelling spruce of the bunch, the tree at Hotel Caf\u00e9 Royal is a collaboration with French perfumery Diptyque. Bedecked with glass baubles, a small menagerie of tiny animals and miniature replicas of the brand\u2019s iconic scented candles, it stands as a lovely addition to the hotel\u2019s grand lobby.\nInspired by luxury fashion house Ralph & Russo, the Lanesborough\u2019s glamorous golden tree invokes the magic of haute couture. Hung with a glittering canopy of crystals and embellished with silk blooms in bright shades of raspberry and ruby, the intricate installation was designed by \u2018event imagineer\u2019 Tony Marklew.\nCreated by designer Yinka Ilori, the vivid addition to the Sanderson\u2019s lobby recalls the joy of seeing wrapped presents on Christmas morning. Designed with industrial materials, the tree is formed of colourful stacked objects with an internal light source, creating a glow from within, complementing the hotel\u2019s modernist architecture and eclectic interiors, designed by Philippe Starck.\nBringing touch of avant-garde to traditional festive decorations, the tree at the W is an iridescent, blow-up affair, surrounded by winking disco balls. To create the scene-stealing spectacle, W partnered with fashion visionary and dynamic artist, Jack Irving, responsible for Lady<|endoftext|>"

This is full of make up items that any beauty addict would love. There's nail polishes, lipsticks, eye shadows, a foundation and even a full sized mascara! A great gift for teenagers and for those that are watching the pennies on the run up to Christmas.\nIf you think this is an ordinary calendar then you'd be wrong. At \u00a3250 its a whole-lotta cash to be spending, and is really a Christmas present in itself! But if you're a Jo Malone fanatic then this might be just up your street, with mini perfumes and body creams all from their best selling scents like Pomegranate Noir ( my personal fav) Lime Basil & Mandarin, and Peony & Blush, it's certainly a beautiful treat if its in your budget!\nThis is slightly different from the other calendars in that there are only 13 windows to open, but never the less deserves a good old mention. 13 beautiful bath time and pamper treats that range from hand lotion, to shower gel and even moisturisers.\nElemis 12 Days of Beauty \u00a359.50 Available NOW here.\nThis is similar to the previous one where there are only 12 days instead of 24. The gift set is filled with Elemis classics like, Pro Collagen Cleansing Balm, Marine Cream, Flash Balm, and bath and body products all worth \u00a3113!\nLush 12 Days Of Christmas \u00a349.95 Available NOW here.\nIf you're an avid lush fan this will interest you greatly. Lush have released an advent full of festive joy to see you through the Christmas period. 12 assorted bath and shower gifts like 'Snow Angle Bath Melt', 'Holly GoLightly Bubble Bar' and 'Hot Toddy Shower Gel' to leave you in the mood for all the seasonal fun.\nThis one sits nicely in between Selfridges and Jo Malone's offerings on price and contains some fantastic gifts. Think Nars, Diptyque, Laura Mercier, Eve Lom and you're on the right path.\nFor all nail polish addicts, this ones for you! Seeing 23 mini polishes and one full sized, all in different shades and finishes.\nChristmas would not be Christmas without a festive candle burning, and Yankee have not disappointed with the release of this years advent calendar. Housing 24 tealights in scents such as 'Snowflake Cookie', 'Cranberry Ice' and 'Christmas Cookie'.\nIf make up and candles aren't your thing this calendar could be just up your street, featuring 24 gold and silver coloured earrings, bracelets and necklaces.\nA slightly cheaper option is the jewellery calendar from Primark containing cute stud earrings, necklaces and rings that would be perfect for teenagers and anyone into fashion.\n Other favourites are the Yankee candle advent ( lets face it who doesn't love a candle at Christmas) and the Lush 12 Days of Christmas.\nWhich are your favourites, and will you be buying any this year?\nThis is a simple and easy way of adding colour into any make up look and to transition into the Autumn season. The shades I've gone of today are purple with a pop of copper sparkle in the centre. By placing this warmer shade in the centre makes the look a lot more wearable and everyday, as purple can be a little hard to carry off - you don't wan to look like you have a bruised or black eye now do you?\nIn the crease place a transistion shade so the colours blend out smoothly. I used 'Peach Smoothie' from Makeup Geek, but any warm toned neutral shade will do, on a fluffy blending brush.\nNext, sweep your purple shade into the crease and socket line. I used Nars 'Seduction' Blush as I didn't have any purple shades.\nTo fill in the outer and inner corners I used Mac 'Cranberry' a rich reddy purple shade with a hint shimmer. Make sure to leave the centre of the eyelid free of shadow as this is where your copper will go. I also blended this under the eye from outer to inner corner.\nI used Mac pigment in 'Copper Sparkle' on a flat brush and patted it onto the lid, and also placed it under the eye in the centre to mimic the colours on the lid.\nTo finish off the look line your upper and lower water line and create a winged liner on the lid, followed with plenty of mascara on the top and bottom lashes, and even add some falsies if you want to?\nWhat eye shadows are you sporting this Autumn?\n This month saw a lot of new products for me as I did do rather a bit of shopping, so some of these are new and some are old favourites.\nThis is a great budget eye primer that creates a perfect base for applying eye shadow to. The sticky formula grabs on to colour, intensifying it and making to last without creasing. There's only one thing though, why the hell didn't I get it sooner?\nThis is another product that I wish I had sooner. So many people raved about this and in my mind I was thinking, \"how good can a lip liner really be?\" Well let me tell ya, it's fab!\nI don't know how it does it, but this baby makes my lips so much bigger than they really are and also acts as a perfect tacky base when you apply lipstick over the top. The colour is perfection and I've been pairing it with a nude lip stick and even worn it alone on days where I cant be bothered, and it's still looked fab. (Full review to follow).\nThis will probably come as no surprise to regular readers. I absolutely adore this perfume. It's everything I look for in a fragrance, it's fresh, light and just perfect. Full stop, end of.\nI tend to be a little slack when it comes to body moisturisers, but this one smells so damn good and sinks in within seconds that its a crime NOT to use it. It's another fresh and light product that leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth leaving a nice cooling sensation behind.\nIf you read my post here it will be no surprise that this has been featured in my monthly favourites. The cream to powder blush is just the perfect colour that flatters and suits the majority of my make up looks. I just can't get enough of it!\nI'm always looking for a good under eye brightener as I do like to sport the whole Kim K look. This setting powder contains tiny flecks of shimmer, but once on the skin are undetectable, and instantly highlights and brightens the areas while setting my concealer in place.\nI've been using this for the past month and have fallen head of heels in love with it. The cleanser is great at removing dirt without drying or stripping the skin.\nOne aspect I wasn't expecting to find was how well to has kept my skin spot and blemish free. I think the cleanser does a fantastic job at controlling oil and hydrating the skin just where it needs it, and the results so far have been completely unexpected and greatly received! (Full review to follow).\nThis is a new discovery of mine and one I have been really impressed with. The product comes in the form of a mousse that is used on dry unwashed hair and then dried in with a heat from a hair dryer. After this you wash and condition as normal and then use it weekly in the middle of the shampoo and condition steps or your hair care routine. I've used this a few times now and I've been surprised at how soft and manageable my hair is left afterwards. It feels nourished from root to tip, looking and feeling like I've had an expensive salon treatment. (Full review to follow).\nWhat products have you been loving this past month?\nTop - 'Shroom'. Middle - 'Club'. Bottom - 'Expensive Pink'.\nIf you read my latest haul post you would have seen a went a bit cray cray in Mac and ended up picking up a few new bits. Some of what I purchased were new eye shadows to add to my MAC palette and I've swatched them here for you to see.\n'Shroom' - is a yellow tone off white with a pearlized satin finish which is perfect for an inner corner highlight or for placing under the eyebrow to highlight the brow bone. It's not the most interesting of colours but the sort of shade I think everyone needs to have in their collection.\n'Club' - a unique colour which looks like a boring brown in the pan but when applied and the light catches it, you can see hints of iridescent blue and even green. This is easily a shade you can wear alone on the lid as it blends out beautifully into the crease and turns to a completely different finish then when it's packed on the mobile lid.\n'Expensive Pink' - is another shade which changes colour in the light. In the pan it's a stunning pinky copper shade which has yellow and gold shimmer running<|endoftext|>"

I can\u2019t wait to read stories of first time Xmas creation booboos, beauty, fun and riotous adventures.\nThe only thing that really matters is that you are together but I\u2019m so sure they\u2019ll want to make it super special too.\nOOOH! I\u2019m so excited for you.\nI ordered Sarah\u2019s book for myself, as well as several bottles of her perfumes. \ud83d\ude42 I prefer not to exchange gifts, hoping to talk my family out of it this year as it\u2019s a pain figuring out what to buy and no one needs anything so it feels like a forced exercise.\nI 100% agree on gift exchange TaraC.

I\u2019d love to find some under our tree but there is no YR in Australia.\nThat\u2019s a wonderful gift list. I\u2019ve mostly done all the purchasing, just a few things remaining. I\u2019m really not feeling the holiday spirit this year though.

That sounds like the most fabulous plan ever. Paris would be a wonderful Xmas destination. We have been there in early January a couple of times and it was perfect.\nJin has often talked of Xmas in Budapest and Vienna.

        "passage": "on Rue des Lilas has been discontinued. And this is a shame because it was one of the few that I liked when this brand launched.\nRue des Lilas opens as a honeyed, powdery floral \u2013 heliotrope, lilac and possibly some orange blossom. The heart is a powdery, waxy lily with tons of indoles. This is not a squeaky clean spring floral. This one has some hints of worn lingerie under the clean, powdery florals. It smells like lilacs which are indolic and have a tinge of \u201crot\u201d in them when they\u2019re on the tree. The dry-down is powdery woods and a soft musk.\nWhat I love about Rue des Lilas is that it\u2019s not this innocent \u201cpurple floral\u201d. Lilacs tend to bring to mind grandmother-ly guest soaps or sheer linen sprays. Rue des Lilas is a voluptuous, debauched lilac soliflore. It is a throwback to those vintage perfumes that threw some raunchiness in with those feminine florals.\nIf you like vintage \u201cpurple\u201d florals, you need to try this. If you like powdery florals, try this. If you want something that captures the \u201cugly\u201d in florals, try this. or if you like perfumes like Malle En Passant, Guerlain Apres le Ondee, Pacifica French Lilac and/or Diptyque Jardin Clos. I perceive Rue des Lilas as a feminine perfume\u2026but a very experienced feminine perfume.\nProjection and longevity is average for an EDT.\nThis one is not available on the Phaedon website. I don\u2019t know if it was discontinued or if it it is being \u201creworked\u201d. I hope it\u2019s being reworked into an EDP so I can buy bottles of it. Samples and decants are available at Surrender to Chance.\nVictoria\u2019s Final EauPINION \u2013 Worn, powdered lilac lingerie. II\u2019m really surprised by how much I love wearing this since none of the other Phaedon scents have stood out to me at all. And of course, this is the one that may be no longer available.\n*Sample purchased by me. Product pic from Fragrantica. Amber Heard by Ellen von Unwerth from iconoly.gy.\nI also heard that this one was discontinued. Too bad, because I liked it. Not enough to use up my sample right away, but I\u2019m glad I still have a little bit in the sample so I can try it a couple more times.\nLast year, Guillaume said he was reworking a few (to improve longevity, etc) and changing bottle design. He didn\u2019t say which ones but I had a feeling that less popular ones would be axed.\nI like these sort of florals. This was on my \u201cto buy\u201d list but other things were in front of it. Oh, well.\nis it just me or does Apres L\u2019Ondee smell like my grandmother\u2019s old refillable Max Factor powder compact?\nSo many cosmetics were (and still are) scented with rose/violet. And Apre L\u2019Ondee has that nice powdery orris. I\u2019m sure it does remind many people of vintage cosmetics\u2026which strangely is an entire genre in itself. I get asked quite frequently \u201cwhich perfumes smell like vintage makeup?\u201d. I guess some people find those nostalgic.\nI like this one and will finishthe decant I have but I didn\u2019t feel that I needed more of it. I would have preferred though for it to be still available \u2013 incase I change my mind later.\nUndina recently posted..How Do You Take Your Amber?\nI do like these sort of fragrances but I rarely wear them. Saying that, I love to smell them. And when I\u2019m in the mood for them, they\u2019re absolutely perfect.\nAnd I wish it were still available. Mainly because there aren\u2019t many lilac perfumes out there \u2013 I can think of i Profumi di Firenze and Pacifica. The Pacifica one is good for the price. And Liz Zorn had a really good one too but I think it was limited edition.<|endoftext|>"

Freshly cut pine.\nChances are there is a scented candle out there that re-creates your Christmas memory, although we are sorry to report that if your remembrance is the cocktail, Yankee Candle\u2019s Alpine Martini has been discontinued.\nThis time of year, candles seem to be everywhere. About 80 percent of Americans use some type of scent in their home, because it makes them \u201cfeel relaxed,\u201d according to a 2018 NPD Group study. The candle business (which had sales of $3.2 billion in 2015, according to the market research firm Mintel) is booming. About 70 percent of sales occur between October and December, according to Kathy LaVanier, president of the National Candle Association.\nArtisan candles have become a thing. One of these makers is Otherland, whose 2018 limited-edition holiday scent is a \u201cwoodsy and warm\u201d Fallen Fir. The company, based in Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side, sells its candles poured in artful glass tumblers that it suggests repurposing for scrunchie storage. The candles come with a tiny box of matching matches, a disappearing yet necessary home accessory.\nScented candles, like perfume, are not for everyone. A few weeks ago, we held an informal sniff test of 14 holiday-scented candles, from the $4.99 Glade Enchanted Evergreens to the $205 Jo Malone White Moss & Snowdrop. The testers\u2019 comments brought a few truths to light: Everyone smells differently, and our parents play heavily into our memories of Christmas.\nThe Thymes Frasier Fir candle, with its notes of Siberian fir needles, sandalwood and cedar brought back these memories for one tester: \u201cIt smells like my dad cussing because the new tree is getting sap all over the carpet.\u201d Another tester said the soapy, musk smell of Innisfree\u2019s Dreaming of Santa candle made the tester think it could \u201cclean my house\u201d; another described it as \u201cfresh laundry.\u201d The Diptyque Baume D\u2019Ambre, which smells like vanilla, benzoin and lavender reminded one tester of \u201cmyrrh or frankincense and reminds me of being in the Lutheran Nativity play\u201d; another said \u201cginger mixed with cleaning solutions.\u201d Two testers mentioned that Aromatique\u2019s the Smell of Christmas conjured up thoughts of cooking with their moms.\nHome fragrance became popular in the 1980s, when potpourri burst onto the nation\u2019s coffee tables, according to LaVanier. In 1982, Arkansas entrepreneur Patti Upton created the Smell of Christmas, a bag of wood shavings, pine cones and berries laced with fragrant spices and oils that became a national sensation. Ten years later, she was selling a million of the $10 cellophane bags of holiday \u201cdecorative home fragrance.\u201d Upton died last year at age 79. But her company, Aromatique, actually holds the registered trademark for \u201cThe Smell of Christmas.\u201d And 36 years after the seasonal scent was introduced, its most popular form is a candle. Why has it lasted? \u201cIt\u2019s the smell that many remember from their grandmother\u2019s house: cinnamon, oranges and spices,\u201d says Chad Evans, Aromatique\u2019s president.\nScent can transport you back: to a snowy Christmas tree farm in Minnesota or to Greenwich Village when tree sellers set up on the sidewalks. Your memory of that first whoosh of evergreen scent stays with you forever.  One of these is Thymes Frasier Fir. When introduced in 2004, it promptly sold out. Today, it is used by some fans year-round, says Amy Banks, brand director for Thymes. There are now 56 products in the Frasier Fir scent, including a pomander ball and dishwashing liquid.\nAt Yankee Candle, the largest candle company in the United States, more than 30 out of 200 fragrances are holiday-oriented. Two of its most popular wintry candles are Balsam and Cedar and the buttery, vanilla Christmas Cookie, according to Jennifer Genson, Yankee Candle\u2019s senior fragrance manager. She says holiday candles sell to all age groups, and millennials have become faithful candle consumers. \u201cThey may be renting a house or apartment, and they want to find a fragrance that represents their personality and creates a sense of place,\u201d Genson says.\nInternationally, Genson says, tastes in holiday scents vary. Genson grew up in France. \u201cIn Paris, we like orange with a bit of clove; that is my smell of Christmas,\u201d she says. \u201cThe scent I remember from living in Italy is panettone, the candied fruit brioche.\u201d No, there is no Yankee panettone candle as of yet.\nOf course, there are candle fanatics, and there are candle haters. For some, the perfect way to relax after work is to pour a beverage, click on Netflix and light a soothing candle. For others, any candle they receive as a gift goes directly into the regifting closet \u2014 the subject of a hilarious \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d skit. Some simply are sensitive to smells and find fragrances irritating.\nSo what should you do if you love to burn them and are having friends over? James Farmer, an interior designer and author from Perry, Ga., says that in most instances, if you\u2019re having a big party in your house and you love scented candles, you should burn what you like. If guests don\u2019t like them, they can discreetly ask you to snuff them out.\nPersonally, he loves candles with a scent, his favorite holiday version being Jo Malone\u2019s<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " they all white, or is it just the perception of a big scent? I love gardenias, and magnolias and jasmine, but sometimes the sheer \"bigness\" of the perfume is too much for me. Fracas is tough for me to take (I keep trying) but Petite Fracas was an eye opener for me when I tried it. Carnal Flower is lovely and I own and adore Sweet Redemption (is orange blossom technically a white floral?). I think it's maybe the tuberose that throws me.\nGenius definitely! What's wrong with Malle's Carnal flower or SL Fleurs d'Orangers? I can wear them anytime. Thanks for the draw.\nI love big white florals in the summer time. It seems like the most natural time to wear them, provided you don't apply with too heavy a hand. I love wearing Amoureuse in the summer, but I have to apply just a drop, because that one is an especially big heavy hitter.\nI love giant white florals, and I love them the most in summertime! What better time to feel so extravagant, so carefree, so swaying-in-a-hammock-on-a-pristine-beach-in-the-South-Pacific?! I get a little woozy just thinking about it. Now let me go get my Fracas fix....\nWhite florals, yay! I'd love to try the 41 & the 49 since I've never tried ANY Le Labo at all. I think summer is a fine time for the big white floral since that is when these types of flowers bloom their little heads off. The heat helps them release their inviting fragrances, and the wonderful aromas take some of the pain out of sweltering in the wretched heat. Thanks for the draw.\nThese both sound really yummy. As to the weather, I've always been of the opinion that my personal weather inside, how I'm feeling, has more to do with my perfume choices than the weather outside. But for sure some flowers just bloom in the heat.\nWhite florals scare the bejeezus out of me but like a fascinating piece of art that I don't quite understand, I keep finding myself drawn back to them. Ylang is the easiest for me to wear so the new Le Labo is already on my \"must try\" list. I think summer is the perfect time for them, they're just so BIG!\nI'm with you there, Lynn Marie. My memories of growing up in the Deep South include ladies wearing lush white florals in summer, and how intensely feminine they smelled. I do recall that one woman in our circle wore Jungle Gardenia, the original one, and it was wonderful. I've never smelled it since leaving home, and would love to if the original were still around.\nHi, lady -- just letting you know that Surrender to Chance carries Jungle Gardenia. I thought I remembered seeing it there a while back and when I read your comment, I went back and checked and there it is.\nThanks so much, Anne, I had just thought of that possibility myself, and there it was. Have to order some on payday, and also the Jardenia,which I've never smelled. I think I'm probably up to it; those of us who grew up in steamy climates are used to flowering and decay going on at the same time!\nPlease enter me! I love white florals, they \u00e1re my bag', as one might say. These two both sound fabulous and are on my 'to try' list. Thus far my favorite white florals have been Songes, Fracas, and Jasmin et Cigarette.\nBWF's are usually pretty potent so they are near and dear to me. Hellyeah. I love blooming in the heat.\nI am just beginning to find what works for me so I would love to try a BWF. Thanks for the draw!\nI think so-going to give it a gentle try-maybe not today having a root canal, ahhhh-any suggestions?\nYes, yes, yes to white florals in summer. I have been wearing Carnal Flower for the past few days. Please enter me in the drawing.\nLove big white florals, clutching my bottle of Songes and hoping we might, just might have a a day warm enough to really appreciate it. Would love to try the Le Labo it sounds wonderful!\nSultry! As long as I don't wilt in the heat, why not bloom? Please enter me in the draw - would love to try these...\nI wore Songes this past summer here in Sydney, but I think it would suit any weather. I'd love to try the new Le Labo, especially the ylang!\nI think it depends on the white floral. For me some work and some don't. Always willing to try new ones to see whether they work or not. Been dying to try these two new LeLabo's along with L'Artisan Caligna and Diptyque Eau Moheli.\nIf you found the right white floral it could be great choise for the summer.First I would think about neroli scent but I was surprised that SSS Jour Ensoleille worked for me in the summer heat.May be because of the chypre structure the white folwers accord doesn't become overwhelming.That makes me very curious about Ylang 49.Thanks for the review!\nLove Le Labo (mostly) and happy to try anything, particularly if it stretches beyond my comfort zone, which some vanillas have. I haven't played much in the big white floral playground, but I'd love a dabble.\nOh hells to the yes! I'm a BWF girl to begin with, and Le Lebo makes it all the better! Would love to win this draw. MIGHT make me mourn my Aldehyde 44 a little less...ok, not likely but I'd love to try these! Thanks!\nOOh, BWFs and aldehydes... you sound like a kindred spirit.\nI was fascinated in a recent blind-sniff with non-perfume-nerds how nose-wrinkly they found white florals (which I have always had a taste for). As for me, I'm very psyched about the new LeLabos after I accidentally fell for Fleurd'Oranger against my will...\nI wouldn't wear Manoumalia in ANY weather, lol, but Lys Mediterr- would work any time of the year. I love Donna Karen Gold but would be hesitant to wear it when its very hot. Can I choose hellmaybe?\nDonna Karan Gold has been fine on me when I've been sweaty, but I discovered just last Sunday that it turns a bit sour when I'm out in the sun.\nI LOVE wearing BWF in the summer. Yup, I do.\nI would say that summer is the only time that I can wear white florals. I've been hearing great things about this one and would love to sample. Thanks for the chance!\nOooh, dying to smell these. I almost bought the Poivre when I was at Harrods, but because of the high price tag I walked away. But I'm dying to find something new and exciting for summer! Merci for the draw (and I live in the U.S., in case it matters!).\nI generally don't like BWF anytime of the year...but I can see Carnal Flower working in the heat, if applied with a light hand. Thanks for the draw.\nOh hellyeah most definitely. Summer heat lets them bloom in a whole new way...like 2 perfumes in one.\nI would love to try both of these. I love white florals, but usually wear them at home. At work, I prefer lighter scents. Thanks for the giveaway--they sound fabulous!!\nI have yet to brave a BWF in the heat of summer, but FeralJasmine's observation about summer being the natural climate for most of 'em makes perfect sense, and has me willling to try!\nHelyeah! I do have to be careful to apply lightly but white florals in the summer are great. It gets really really hot and humid here and not sweating is just not gonna happen. Big white florals mix well with that warm clean sweat scent. I am really dying to try Ylang 49 and hope that when I finally do it lives up to my fantasy. Chypre ylang gardenia- mmmmm.\nHellyeah! Orange blossom, tiare, clover, linden. Bring it! Awesome giveaway, please enter me in the draw. Thank you!\nI am reserved, practical and I love me some white florals. Who would have guessed? Something about Carnal Flower, or better yet Tuberose Criminelle just works for me.\nGenius for sure.\nWould love to try these two! I adore white florals and I love them best in the summer. After all, that's the natural climate of most of those flowers. Some of my best memories of growing up in Louisiana are the rich heady scents that filled the air, from osmanthus in late February to gardenias and magnolias in deep summer. So I'm using more white florals as the temp increases. Lilies and ylang ylang in summer? Genius, definitely.\nI visited a farm in rural Louisiana a few years ago and spent most evenings sitting on the front porch next to the immense gardenia plant. It must've been 6-8 ft. tall and 5 ft<|endoftext|>"

But consider this: I\u2019ve been searching for a new signature scent (get loads of samples before you commit, was the best advice) and realized that maybe having more than one, like a perfume wardrobe, could be modern. This is coming from someone who doesn\u2019t own a lipstick and hasn\u2019t really worn a fragrance in 20 years.

Mother let me pick out a bag on a trip to Rome in 1978 and I chose the one above. A camel hobo, unsurprisingly. Since it\u2019s firmly in my never-changing wheelhouse, I\u2019m going to drop it at Leather Spa and let them do their magic. Will I carry it again? Very possibly.\nThe bottom three are from the early \u201990s. They had bamboo handles, which I removed the moment I purchased them and looped the messenger strap instead.

That makes bergamot particularly beneficial for mental strife, alleviating symptoms of stress and anxiety to leave only a feel-good atmosphere.\nHow do I make my candles smell like bergamot?\nUsing the double boiler method, melt the wax until completely dissolved into a liquid. I added about 2o drops of Lavender and 20 drops of Bergamot essential oils to the melted wax. You can add desired amount of oils. Lavender is calming and is a floral fragrance, while Bergamot is uplifting and a citrus scent.\nWhat is the nicest smelling candle?\nL\u2019Occitane Cocon De S\u00e9renit\u00e9\u200b Relaxing scented candle.\nWhat scents does bergamot pair with?\nBergamots also work well together with fresh herbs like basil, rosemary, sage and even thyme. This fragrant citrus has a natural affinity for bold, heady spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, cumin, cardamom (think ras-el-hanout) and star anise. Other aromatic matches include ginger and lemongrass.\nWhat smells similar to bergamot?\nBergamot is widely used in perfumery because of its complementary nature to other scents like rosemary, sandalwood, jasmine and vetiver.\nHow much essential oil to add to candles. I have found through much testing, that you will want to add a minimum of about 100 drops of essential oil for every pound of wax.\nCan I use lemon juice to scent a candle?\nCan you use lemon juice to scent candles? Absolutely not! Adding a watery liquid like lemon juice to melted wax will ruin the wax. It\u2019s also quite dangerous to pour a cold liquid into hot wax.\nCan you use essential oils to scent candles?\nWhat are the strongest smelling scented candles?\nZoe Tang Terrarium Candle.\nWhat are the longest lasting scented candles?\nBrooklinen Nightcap Candle \u2014 $35.00.\nThese are the candles your favorite celebrities are obsessed with and for you to treat yourself to.\nBlake Lively: Santal 26 by Le Labo.\nWhat is the most popular scent in the world?\nWhat is the most popular wax melt fragrance?\n\nWhat are popular wax melt scents?\nSnow Fairy and Lemon &amp, Lavender are usually in the mix as being very popular.

If you like, you can also stir in some orange zest. Pour the hot wax into the orange rinds, filling to the top.\nCan you put herbs and flowers in candles?\nTo scent a candle, herb plants can be finely chopped or crushed to help release their fragrance. \u2026 Adding sprigs of leaves and small flower stems around the edge of the candle while it\u2019s being poured is another decorative way for using plants in candles. This method works best for wide, clear candle jars.\nCan you use fresh fruit in candles?\nYou can make the candles to order in canning jars with the homegrown fruit of your choice for a rustic addition to a dinner or wedding table centerpiece. \u2026 Fruit gel candles, which are not difficult to make in a short amount of time, make thoughtful handmade housewarming or holiday gifts.\nWhat essential oils are toxic when burned?\nWhat kind of oil is used to scent candles?\nWhich essential oils are safe to burn in candles?\nIf you have purchased your candles for their scent, use them within a year and store them properly between uses to get the most fragrance from your candle.

        "passage": " power.\nAlthough nothing can rival the scent of jasmine in the warm evening air, one can seduce oneself and others with fragrances like Serge Lutens A La Nuit (opulent, balsamic jasmine), Annick Goutal Songes (romantic, multifaceted jasmine,) Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle Le Parfum de Th\u00e9r\u00e8se (jasmine as smouldering and yet distant as a Hitchcockian blonde,) Van Cleef & Arpels First (ravishing classic.) If you are new to exploring rich floral notes, I would particularly recommend L\u2019Artisan Parfumeur La Chasse Aux Papillons, which is as light as a spring breeze (and to this day remains the top seller for L\u2019Artisan).\nLeather, honey, spice and flowers, the scent of saffron possesses an amazing voluptuousness. When I prepared my Valentine\u2019s Day dinner last year, saffron received its due in shrikhand, an Indian rosewater and saffron mousse. I love the way saffron lingers on the palate, revealing all of its beautiful facets.\nWhen it comes to perfume, a unique musky-leather note of saffron has more of a supporting role. In a gorgeous Ormonde Jayne Ta\u2019if, it rounds out the opulent rose and tempers the sweetness of dates and honey. However, smell L\u2019Artisan Parfumeur Safran Troublant and discover what a beautiful prima ballerina saffron can make\u2014it combines depth and complexity with an unusual lightness. Needless to say, one can hardly resist it.\nPerfumes the axe that lays it low.\u201d Rabindranath Tagore, Indian poet.\nThe scent of sandalwood is unlike that of any other wood. Milky and creamy, it recalls the aroma of skin as well as rose petals. It evokes velvet and the color red for me, while it immediately puts me in a serene mindset, which is ideal for a romantic evening.\nSadly, natural sandalwood has been so overharvested as to place it out of the perfumers\u2019 reach (with very few exceptions). Most of the fragrances are now formulated either with sandalwood aroma-materials, which can be spectacular (such as Givaudan\u2019s Javanol) or Australian sandalwood, a material which possesses little of the Indian sandalwood\u2019s beauty. Nonetheless, I am still charmed by Corso Como (a rosy, velvety sandalwood), Diptyque Tam Dao (drier, cedarwood accented fragrance), and Lubin Idole de Lubin (rich, yet translucent rendition liberally embellished by spices). For a classical femme fatale fragrance, few can rival the gorgeous Chanel Bois des Iles. Moreover, a comment below reminded me of how much I love Serge Lutens Santal de Mysore, a striking rich sandalwood with a delicious spicy overtone. I can only blame the jet lag for omitting it. Finally, Costes roomspray and candle are a wonderful way to infuse your ambience with the mysterious aroma of sandalwood.\nPlease see Part II of Romantic Notes.\nElizabeth: Oh, that Caravaggio painting is wonderful! How tragic that it no longer exists.\nI\u2019m wearing Safran Troublant right now, in preparation for writing a bit about it, and am so pleased to see that you get that same sense of complex lightness from it. And Ta\u2019if is a truly romantic scent. Rose and saffron \u2014 how can that ever be wrong?\nAline et Valcour: I have a Santal de Mysore by Serge Lutens bottle, do you know if it \u2018s made out of real natural Mysore sandalwood, is it a combination of natural and synthetic? Serge Lutens claims the Mysore sandalwood is the purest.\nI saw this documentary last year (on the french channel TV5 Monde) about saffron, the rarest and most expensive spice in the world. The purest comes from the Atlas mountains in Morrocco, its production is extremely limited, 90% of saffron sold in morroccan saouks is fake.\nTarn: I\u2019m new to this site, and I am very much enjoying your articles and reviews. It\u2019s very nice to find a place where people feel the way I do about perfume. Thank you!\nI only have one perfume which is (I think) based on saffron \u2013 Agent Provocateur (the one in the pink opaque bottle). I find it a little sweet on some days, on others the underlying spiciness shows through and cuts the sweetness.

        "passage": "Giacobetti in an unstoppable strain of fig-producing mode went on to create an Eau de Parfum version to the best-selling Premier Figuier, baptized Premier Figuier Extreme, highlighting the rounder elements and extending its stay. This EDP version even has its own fig-shaped limited edition bottle! Both lines have matching and faithful home fragrances in the form of sprays and scented candles which recreate a paradisial, calming atmosphere at home for when you want to bring back those lazy summer days of skulking aimlessly and relax.\nAnother great approximation to the scent of the fig tree and its ambience is A la Figue by Satellite. A study (fugue) on fig, it\u2019s delectable, piquantly bittersweet and dustily green just like the imposing trees themselves are. So is Carthusia\u2019s unisex Io, an aromatic composition with tea leaves inspired by the majestic villa the Emperor Tiberius built on Capri.\nNevertheless, much as realism is admired in perfumery when recreating a certain smell, one could not leave out impressionism. And herein enters one of the most individual and unique renditions of figs in recent perfumery, the one which Jean Claude Ellena proposed for Hermes with his first Jardin offer, Un Jardin en Mediterran\u00e9e. Inspired by a plate of fresh figs, offered by a young woman, hot (so to speak) off the branch in a garden in Tunisia, the scent presents the bitter, sharp and yet imposing qualities that the inspiration behind it must have conjured in its creator\u2019s mind like taking in the serene paysage and the introspective, philosophical thoughts the latter surely triggered. The fragrance\u2019s coolness and vegetal feel, comparable to tomato leaf, is truly imaginative.\nMiller Harris with her Figue Am\u00e8re is proposing another fig off the beaten path. The salty, slightly bitter impression of the composition is perhaps a nod to the usual accompaniment of figs in the countries where they\u2019re consumed by the gallon: salty cheese. Salt at once cuts down on bitterness and rounds out flavors, providing the perfect backdrop for such a central idea as unripe figs. Complimentary notes of ambery fir balsam, shady violet leaves, bitter angelica and citric hesperidia demand an inquisitive and adventurous soul to carry it off with panache.\nThe most perverse and love-it-or-hate-it fig fragrance however has to be Womanity by Thierry Mugler. There is a watery-sweet note on top which is very unusual: The fruity note passingly resembles that in Un Jardin En Mediterran\u00e9e or Figue Am\u00e8re by Miller Harris, but whereas the warmth co-existed with the cool in the Herm\u00e8s fragrance, laid on thin over the green notes, and it was bitterish-cool in the Miller Harris, in Womanity the figs have caramelised. Their succulent flesh id more apparent in the sun than the leaves or the bark of the tree, with a nod to fig cookies as well. And then the salty note, said to evoke caviar!! Its intimate, lightly animalic quality is musky and intriguing and shows the frontier options to bypass.\nJo Malone in the line\u2019s usual luminous, diaphanous style presents Wild Fig and Cassis, marrying the sourness of cassis with their ammoniac note with the sweeter aspects of the fig fruit in a simple game of a contrasting duet. Guerlain on the other hand opted for the delicate and earthy-powdery anchor of iris along with the house\u2019s characteristic sweet vanilla note in their playful fruity-accented Figue Iris. The fragrance forms part of the Guerlain Aqua Allegoria line, a collection of refreshing simple colognes that partake of beloved materials in simple compositions.\nMore tropical nuances reminiscent of beach vacations and sunscreen lotion are explored in Coco Figue by Comptoir Sud Pacifique, a French line in aluminum cans fit for travelling and inspired by exotic locales, as well as by Fresh in their Fig Apricot where two summery fruits conspire to give a delectable treat that tempts to be eaten rather than dabbed.\nOther fig fragrances in the niche sector include: Ninfeo Mio by Annick Goutal (with its matching candle Sous le Figuier), Les Nez Turtle Vetiver Front, Fig & Garcons by Nez a Nez, Fico di Amalfi by Aqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo, Fig Tree by Sonoma Scent Studio, Figuier Eden by Armani Privee, Hermessence Santal Massoia (Hermes), Fig Tea by Patricia de Nicolai, Byredo's Pulp, Fico Verde by Antica Farmacista, Sous le Figuier by M.Micallef, Figaro by Lubin, Aftelier's Fig built on all naturals, Bois et Fruits by Serge Lutens, Fresh Fig by Laura Mercier, Mediterranean Fig by Pacifica, and Henri Bendel's Wild Fig.\nEven more mainstream brands have embraced the fig fad in their portfolio, starting with Marc Jacobs Men, Marc Jacobs Splash Fig, Island Capri by Michael Kors, and Versace Versence, all the way down to Bath & Body Works Brown Sugar & Fig, proving niche brands map out emerging markets.\nDo you like figs and fig scents? Which is your favorite?\nI love reading your aromamaterials posts, E.\nOh, I love fig perfumes (not so much figs though).\nI somehow missed the Fig Tree by SSS but I will definitely give it a try. So far my favourites are Premier Figuier (it's just so easy to love), Philosykos (of course) and Figue Amere.\nOne that just didn't sit right with me is IO Capri by Carthusia.\nEver since a child I loved the scent of fig leaves (figs not so much) and to this day it is the one scent that says summer to me more than anything else. Philosykos is the only fig fume I have tried that can create this feeling. Nothing else comes even close.\nI have read a lot of reviews that mention Womanity as a \"disturbing\" perfume. It is totally acceptable to my nose. The one I can't really appreciate is Figue Amere. To me it smells clearly of peach. The components of the fragrance are not well blended and it soon falls apart to what I can describe as a \"sticky mess\". Too bad because I had high hopes for the \"Amere\" part...\nHope you're very well, honey!\nI think Laurie's interpretation is very credible. To try, for sure! PF and Philosykos are the golden standards, so naturally most people find them great.\nI think Io is more masculine leaning which makes it a bit foreign on feminine skin. More citrusy than usual perhaps?\nYeah, fig leaves have a smell all their own. It's fortunate that fig trees grow so chaotically wild all over Greece and provide some welcome shade in the summer. Many an impromptu pic-nic after a swim was aided by the shade of those flat leaves. I think Philosykos is unsurpassable in this game and believe most Greeks would agree with us (in the realistic capturing of an atmosphere).\nAs to Womanity it's surely a most challenging perfume, though I can see the appeal. It's quite intense, which is why I find it hard to wear personally, but I can understand how it's innovative nevertheless (Mugler does nothing by halves, it seems, an interesting range).\nFigue Amere is an acquired taste, I agree with you. I found it has a touch of weird salty apricot if anything, very savory instead of sweet or woody dry, which is unusual, as if one was wrapping the skin of the figs with cheese or something. Odd.\nMy favorite is the L'Artisan Premier Figuier Extreme edp. The combo of fig, sandalwood and galbanum is delectable and serene to me. I wear this one year round. I also appreciate the Pacifica Med. Fig in solid form for airplane travel.\nI'm also hoping to get Un Jardin en Mediterran\u00e9e some time soon, and Sonoma Scent Studios and Figue Am\u00e8re are on my try-to list, they sound very intriguing.\noh good, thanks for saying so, I'm so glad to prompt discoveries!!\nYour comment on the temp having an effect on projection of certain fragrances is spot on! How true. NM is very refreshing indeed.\nDo try the Mediterranee especially, it's a very refined interpretation!\nElena - I too LOVE your aroma material articles! I think I have read and re read every one of them many times. :) It's a gem of a resource.\nNow Fig- L do love figs fresh and raw and I have been known to eat several in succession!\nHowever, why is Fig often paired with coconut - Premier Fig Extreme was strong and coconutty on me. I am sure it has something to do with imparting creaminess but still....\nI quite like Ichnusa by Profumum though.\nI must re sample the L'Artisans and the Diptyque to see how they fare for me these days. I was able to get over the coconut<|endoftext|>"

Thoughts positive and/or negative?\nSure blind buy for me.\nRe: Latest Diptyque - Eau Rihla!\nNotes sound interesting. Will always try out new Diptyques, but have not been enamored lately.\nExactly why I'm not interested. They seem to have fallen to the curse of becoming just another dull niche house trying to milk their brand legacy for all its worth.\nThis fragrance in question just sounds like generic oriental slop. Saffron, Iris, Vanilla, Cedar...just add cypriol and you have the basic template of every oriental niche fragrance released in the last 10 years. Instead, they've gone for raspberry and leather instead...how original.\nPeople complain about derivative fragrances in the designer world, like the dark blues and woody ambers and ambroxan. I find the derivative nonsense in the niche world far more annoying.\nThis just looks like something designed purely to be sold in a Dubai airport, right down to the label. It's perfume at its most cynical.\nThe whole Orpheon launch put me off. To me, the advertising, the \"story\", and sales pitch by their SAs seemed almost like gaslighting. I was expecting something woody and unisex, recalling old Paris. The juice itself is so different than what all that marketing presented, I'm still shocked. My thoughts anyway.\nKeen to try, as with any Diptyque. Eau de Minthe and Eau Capitale, Tempo and Vetiverio EdP released over the last few years are all solid fragrances in my opinion. Orpheon seems to get a lot of flak on here, but I haven't tried it so cannot possibly comment (even though I agree the advertising was a bit... not on brand).\nInteresting bottle design, was used with their black labels, but some change can be good.\nNote wise, can go many direction: Very good or just average but sure sample worthy!!\nLike the notes. Let us know what you think once you receive this.\nWorth a sniff when it becomes available to try.<|endoftext|>"

Thanks again for the draw!\nI haven't explored many vanilla perfumes... maybe a goal for the new year?\nLoved reading your Vanilla series, very informative!\nI like vanilla to eat of course, and it makes an appearance in many perfumes I like but a wall of vanilla makes me feel like I'm drowning. I've loved reading the vanilla series though! Mind opening...\nThanks for the opportunity at the draw!\nI love vanilla scents and have really enjoyed the series. I wore L'artisans Tea for Two today which had a lovely vanilla note in the base. Thanks for the Tauer draw.\nThank you for the wonderful opportunity! I have loved the Tauer fragrances I have been lucky enough to try so far.\nI'd love to be entered in the draw; meanwhile I'm usually a fan of the woody vanillas but you've sold me on Vanille Galante! Thanks for the rec.\nI would love to be entered in the drawing - Andy's work is always so amazing!\nRe: Quirky vanilla fragrances - I always found Ava Luxe's Ambra Tibet to be an odd one - very vanilla with an unexpected almost menthol quality.\nI haven't found a vanilla that I love but the \"boozy Vanille by Mona di Orio\" sounds like one I'd like to try. Andy's fragrances are among my favorites. Please enter me in the draw and thank you for hosting!\nOops, that's me at 19:04 - Rachel h. Thanks.\nHi! I found my over to this site by following Andy Tauer's Advent Calendar post, so of course I would like to be entered into the draw.\nI am newly pregnant and my sense of smell has turned into a superpower. The only vanilla I can handle at the moment is Vanilla Insensee. Atelier's entire line of light but persistent and interesting scents really seem to be working for me right now.\nOh this vanilla series. Have they come to an end? I enjoyed them so much. I am not sure I know of many quirky vanillas. I know I have a very visceral reaction to vanilla; for instance, Vanilla Incensee makes me want to shower in alcohol and then scrub myself down with coarse salt.\nI will try Douce Amere since it is one of your favorites. And, please, do enter me in Andy's contest.\nEau Duelle is on my wish list, but I'm waiting to go through my bottle of Eau de Shalimar first. These are the only vanillas I have not found cloying so far (not that I have sampled that many).\nPlease enter me into the Andy Tauer draw. Thank you!\nI'd love to be part of the draw! Korres Cinnamon Vanilla sounds wonderful, and very season-appropriate. I enjoy the cinnamon-vanilla pairing in L de Lolita Lempicka, but that's less quirky and more edible - starting out heavy and decadent and drying down into the salty/sweet combination of the snack food you just can't leave alone.\nI need to spend more time with vanilla, I think, though I'm not generally a gourmand fan.\nVanilla and Andy Tauer = perfume heaven and favorite things!\nI am not really into vanilla scents - it is a note I try to learn to appreciate.\nI would like to take a part in this wonderful draw.\nMy vanilla is Caron's Pour Un Homme.\nI'd love to participate in the draw, thank you!\nI love Vanille by Mona di Orio - a very personal interpretation of this ingredient.\nI would love to be included in the draw as well!\nShalimar was my first perfume and I've never looked back. Although I sample many different types, my comfort scents always list vanilla as one of their base notes. I'd say my quirky vanilla would be Cologne of the Missions Le Couvent des Minimes. Pure sweet vanilla as I've never smelled it before. A very unusual fragrance.\nKindly enter me in the draw...\nThank you for hosting Andy's fun Advent Calendar. Love him, love LDDM and URV. Love your blog...I new have a few more frags I must try!\nThough I cannot tolerate cloyingly sweet florals, I love vanilla even when it is much sweeter than what I normally like.\nOne of the few department store perfumes that I wear is Organza Indecence. I know...sweet, but I love it and always get compliments when I wear it.\nI think Vanille by Mona di Orio is quirky and wonderful.\nI would like to be entered in the draw. Thank you for hosting!\nI love quirky vanilla and three of those on your list today are favorites: Vanille Insensee, Vanille Galante and Cuir Beluga. However, my favorite vanillas are the woodsy, smoky ones like MdO's Vanille and, most especiallly, CB I Hate Perfume's 7 Billion Hearts. Thank you and thank Andy for the draw!\nVanilla - the most exotic orchid scent ever!!\nVanilla mixed with citrus sounds lovely. Great draw!\nI'd like to participate in the draw, please!\nI would love to take part in the drawing. Thank you!\nThank you for hosting Andy Tauer's drawing today, and a thank you to Andy for being so generous with his Advent Calendar!\nFor vanilla scents, I enjoy two that you mentioned today: Vsnilla Anise and Douce Amere.\nAnd please include me in the drawing!\nI love all kinds of vanilla fragrances, though the only one I have on this list is Vanille Insens\u00e9e.\nMy *favorite* is Mona di Orio's Vanille.\nMy fav is L'artisan Havana Vanille/Vanille Absolument because it is a dry one and not gourmand.\nWould love to be entered in the drawing. It is colder than normal in Seattle and I have been wrapping myself up in Shalimar!\nplease do enter me in the drawing for the tauer set! love the tauer perfumes that i have tried.\nlove \"douce amere\"---it's one of the vanilla containing scents i do like. would like to try the diptyque \"eau duelle\" as it sounds very intriguing.\nThanks for including me in the draw!\nI'd love to take part in the draw.\nAs for vanilla, the only vanilla fragrance I can tolerate to some extent is Un Bois Vanille, as it smells smoky to me.\nHello! I like bitter vanilla, as was in old versions of \"Comptoir Sud Pacifique\"s scents before their re-formulation.\nFave vanilla is By Kilian's Amber Oud -- not very quirky, but lovely nonetheless.\nI've really been enjoying your Vanilla Series, and have saved all the posts for future reference. The only one of the above I've tried so far is Vanille Insensee, which smelled like sweet cardboard on me.\nPlease enter me in the drawing, and many thanks to you and Mr. Tauer.\nLove to be in the draw! When it comes to favourite vanillas - i love vanilla- it's for the moment un bois vanille by mr serge lutens. But in always looking for a new favourite!\nPlease enter me in the draw,Elena!I enjoy vanilla scents,but not those that emphasize the gourmand part too much.I like and own Shalimar and Dzing,and I'm interested in testing Felanilla.But I admit vanilla wouldn't be my main pursuit as I like chypres,leathers,dark florals and animalic orientals more.\nMy favorite vanilla aspect is the smokey one. The best vanilla ever to me is a Lafco vanilla candle, it was not sweet! Please enter me in the draw.\nMy favorite vanilla so far from all the series you are presenting is the Mona di Orio.\nPlease enter me for the Tauer draw. Thanks.\nI would like to participate in the draw!\nAnother vanilla? why not Noir Tropical by Maria Candida Gentile? velvet and elegant, not sweetish at all.\nI would like to participate in the draw for Andy's wonderful prize.\nI like vanilla fragrances best if they're not too sweet. I adore Santa Maria Novella \"Vaniglia,\" although, it took a while for me to appreciate it because it's got so many facets.\nI do like vanilla, as long as it isn't paired with something too sweet.\nlove vanilla,favorites include Lalique,Sweet redemption,hypnotic poison.love to be in draw please.\nHaven't played much in the vanillas, still so much to explore... The Advent Calendar is amazing.\nAh. I like smokey, woody vanillas, like Tabacco Vanille.\nThis looks great- I'd love to take part!\nGuerlain's Tonka Imperiale! But right now I'm obsessed with L'Air du Desert Marocain!\nwin the prize!\nI enjoy vanilla scents! I think my favorites are L by Lotita Lempicka (by Maurice Roucel) and Body Fantasies Vanilla (floral vanilla without going too plastic on my skin).

The core idea of the project was to evoke the memory of the brand\u2019s emblematic candle wick, which is at the beginnings of its success.\nIn partnership with a braided sheathing manufacturer, Aptar beauty + home developed, after many long compatibility trials, a two-colour braided over-tube in black and white to cover the diptube in the manner of an oil lamp wick. The diptube was then assembled on the VP4 pump, Aptar beauty + home\u2019s best seller for the perfume industry.\nIn parallel to this, Aptar beauty + home also came up with a way of optimizing the tightening of the sheath, while keeping the possibility of assembling it on a tube.\nThe result: an innovative product on the market, which gives a whole new dimension to the diptube that brands were rather hiding rather than highlighting.<|endoftext|>"

This is an 8.4% increase in rents from a year ago.\n\u201cWhilst sources of demand for office space have undoubtedly diversified over the past few years the reality is that the TMT sector along flexible space operators have to a large degree supported the market through the past two to three years. Going forward a key question for the Singapore office market is whether it can rely on this phenomenon given some evidence of consolidation and M&A activity amongst the sector\u201d.\nIn addition, a significant volume of approximately 1 million sf of primary vacant space will come onto the market over the next three years. The availability of this space has arisen due to some major tenant relocations into new buildings, but also from the adoption of alternative workplace strategies by large occupiers that have in some instances enabled reduction in leased floor space.\nCBRE Research maintains a 2018 full-year rental increase call of 9.6 per cent for Grade A rents.\nThe gap in the rents and vacancy rates in the city fringe business parks and the rest of island continued to widen.\nThe city fringe submarket saw a 0.9 per cent growth in rents to reach $5.65 psf as vacancy as tracked by CBRE Research compressed to 3.6 per cent in Q1 2018, the lowest level since 2012. Business park rents in the rest of island submarket maintained at $3.70 psf as vacancies continued to increase in Q1 2018.\nWhilst occupier demand seems to favour the city fringe business park submarket, there is a very limited pipeline of new prime buildings. High quality existing available space remains the sweet spot, but in contrast, challenges still remain for the older generation business parks where building obsolescence is an issue.\nA new business park and office development \u2013 ALICE - located in Mediapolis at one north represents the only notable business park project coming on line in 2018. This development is aimed at meeting strong demand from the fast growing TMT sector.\nPrime retail rents recorded its first rise after 12 quarters. Prime rents of shopping malls along Orchard Road rose 0.5% q-o-q in Q1 2018.\nDesmond Sim, Head, CBRE Research, Singapore & South East Asia \u201cWhilst the increase was minor, it signals a shift in the needle on the prime retail market. Retailers have come to terms with labour constraints and pressures from the growth of e-commerce. Slightly improved optimism is supported by the underlying economy and the improving job market. The growth in tourist arrivals and the increase in retail sales have encouraged retail landlords. It is not a picture of health by any means and challenges remain for fringe or secondary shopping malls, but after three years of rent decline there is some positive news for the prime retail segment\u201d.\nVacancy in Orchard Road as tracked by URA was at a low of 5.7 per cent in 4Q 2017, as compared to the high of 9.3 per centin 2Q 2016.\nAthleisure, beauty and health and F&B segments continued to drive enquiries for retail space. Mui Kee Congee opened in Shaw Centre after a 6-month pop-up at Casa Verde. 3 Michelin starred Forbidden Duck and popular Hong Kong chain Tsui Wah are opening in Singapore. French perfume houses Henry Jacques and Diptyque opened their first standalone boutique at Marina Bay Sands and Ngee Ann City respectively. Sephora expanded with a 5,300 sf store at Westgate.\nNo malls are being developed along Orchard Road in the next three years.<|endoftext|>"

It makes me wonder whether there are any perfumes containing rose which she does NOT like. She speaks in such glowing terms of virtually every rose-containing perfume in existence! Are there no distinctions in quality whatsoever?\nMy favorite Rose perfume is definitely and without a doubt Guerlain's \"Rose Barbare\", with Goutal's \"Ce Soir ou Jamais\" in a tie for second place with Boadicea's \"Glistening\". I also really love Tea Rose by Perfumer's Workshop and Ineke's Briar Rose.\nI don't include my Rose/Oud combinations... those are in a list of their own. There is nothing like a beautiful Rose fragrance. There are SO many of them out there... one for everybody to find and enjoy in their own way!!\nThere are SO many of them out there... one for everybody to find and enjoy in their own way!!\nGood point! The author of the piece probably agrees with you and does not want to show any favoritism... But surely she makes distinctions of some sort?\nCouture Guru is right: \"Rose Barbare\" deserves special mention!\nOh,yes, me, too!\n\"Rose Barbare\" is definitely the best so far.\nFor a darker rose, I can recommend Washington Tremletts \"Black Tie\" and among the Montale Oud range, \"Aoud Flowers\" has the most mature and respectable approach to the rose theme.\nMay I also add a warning? Never ever wear Cartier's \"Declaration d'un Soir\" together with clothes that are difficult to wash!\nThis perfume contains what we will be getting in the future once the IFRA succeeds with their plans to prohibit natural rose oil.\nI quite liked the Serge Lutens Sa majesty la Rose when I tried it in a shop but I haven't given it a test run yet.\nYou open the window where you see the story. Highlight the URL on the top of that page. Right Click/ Copy.\nGo back into this composing box and Right Click/ Paste the URL.\nYes, you are right Apicius... but this is one of the facets of d'un Soir that I really like... it hangs out forever on my clothes and projects beautifully. I've had so many compliments while wearing it and it is another favorite Rose for me... but I agree that it should preferably be worn with the same outfit... teehee...\nNow my interest is piqued--I believe that there is a sample of this in my queue. I'll have to try it!\nAll of this discussion about rose and IFRA is making me wonder what power they have over stuff like rose absolute/essential oil. They cannot outlaw that, can they? Maybe the solution is to go natural, using essential oils and reminiscing on \"the old days\" when perfume was perfume?\n\"Demeter Naturals Rose\"\nI like Chlo\u00e9 by Chlo\u00e9 (2007 version); I know honey isn't a note, but it smells like honey and roses to me. I have trouble wearing it due to an association with it, but I like the smell on others.\nPortrait of a Lady by EdP Frederic Malle is an outstanding composition featuring rose and incense with raspberry support over a patchouli base. This is my favorite fragrance outright.\nLalfeorosa by O'driu is an entirely original spicy composition that uses rose to tone down its more aggressive spicy facets. Another that is in my top 5 fragrances outright, but is sadly unavailable (and super-expensive at about $1200 a bottle even when it was).\nJHL (vintage) by Aramis features a great rose and carnation tandem.\nUne Rose by EdP Frederic Malle is a reference calibre rose soliflore.\nLumiere Noire pour Homme by MFK is a fragrance that uses a soft rose to support the other complex facets it offers... IMO the best from MFK.\nUne Fille de Berlin by Serge Lutens is another outstanding rose soliflore that gives Une Rose a run for its money for a lot less.\nNo. 89 (vintage) by Floris is a classic woody vetiver composition with rose support.\nI could go on and on as there are so many outstanding ones on the market...\nOne very nice rose scent is \"Deep Roses\" by MONTALE. You cannot have any more roses than with that scent (and some tangerines).\nSerge Lutens' \"La Fille de Berlin\"\nSerge Lutens' \"Sa Majeste La Rose\"\nKeiko Mecheri's \"Bal de Roses\"\nKeiko Mecheri's \"Attar de Roses\"\nJo Malone's \"Rosewater and Vanilla\"\nDiptyque's \"L'Ombre Dans L'Eau\"\nGreat inexpensive rose: Lanvin Rumeur 2 Rose - rose with light green notes. Nice for summer.\nValandria and Cincy, thanks for resurrecting this thread.\nMy two favorites are, unfortunately, really expensive so I have obtain them in decants.\nThat sounds like a good combination to me!\nForum Overview Perfumes by Note, Accord, Genre What are your favorite Rose perfumes?<|endoftext|>"

In fact, she has proved time and again that she is a force to be reckoned with \u2013 and her favourite perfume says the same thing about her!

        "passage": "And no, they\u2019re not like your middle school body spray.\nListen, I know that when you hear the words \u201cvanilla perfume,\u201d you may have unpleasant flashbacks to middle school days where you routinely doused yourself in warm vanilla sugar body spray in the locker room. And yeah, you may not want to invest in those too-sweet, headache-inducing scents now that you\u2019re officially ~adulting~. Trust me, I get it. But vanilla perfume can feel sophisticated and can be grown-up, you just have to find the right one.\nAnd by \u201cright\u201d one, I mean investing in a perfume that has l-a-y-e-r-s of that yummy sweet vanilla scent we all know and love but is also paired with muskier and richer notes to create a perfect balance of alluring and warm. That almost too sweet sugar vanilla aroma\u2014reminiscent of your adolescent days\u2014is upgraded to a more adult, (dare I say, seductive?) complex fragrance consisting of notes such as bergamot or mahogany. It\u2019s a vanilla fragrance but not like the super-sweet one you once knew.\nIn order to nail that scent, you\u2019re going to want to invest in one of these 28 best vanilla perfumes because once you do, those middle school flashbacks will ~cease~ to exist. Which, I\u2019m sure we all can agree, is not a bad thing. And if you want something a little muskier for those days when you're feeling less sweet, try one of our favorite winter fragrances of the season.\nI\u2019m kicking off this list with the sweetest gourmand scent in the bunch: Philosophy\u2019s Fresh Cream fragrance. Once the perfume sits on your skin and gives off the vanilla and whipped cream notes, you\u2019ll be left with the sweet, sweet smell of sugar alllll day long. But don\u2019t be scared, it\u2019s not too overwhelming, but it is stronger, so only buy if you have a nose (and love) for sweetness.\nRemember when I said that a ~sophisticated~ vanilla perfume should be accompanied by deeper notes? Well, YSL\u2019s Black Opium is a prime example of that. \nWhen Grande released her best-selling Cloud perfume in 2018, it hit the ground running (considering it always seems to sell out). Yeah, this perfume is youthful due to its praline and vanilla orchard heart notes, but its sophisticated lavender, pear, and bergamot notes deepen it up to keep the scent from smelling overly sweet.\nIf you\u2019ve been lookin\u2019 for a flirty scent, Prada\u2019s Candy Kiss is just the one for you. The fragrance is soft due to the addition of musk accords, sweet due to the vanilla, but not headache-inducing, thanks to the addition of the natural-smelling orange blossom.\n Mugler\u2019s Alien Goddess perfume is a warm floral scent composed of bergamot, jasmine, and bourbon vanilla. If you are a fan of the original Alien perfume but want something a little fresher, here\u2019s your next signature scent.\nHave you ever smelled the intoxicating scent of a vanilla gin martini? If you know what I\u2019m talking about, hi, hello, and if you don\u2019t, allow me to break it down: It smells sugary sweet thanks to the vanilla but is beautifully balanced thanks to the splash of citrus. The Diptyque Eau Duelle fragrance emulates that scent perfectly when applied and is quickly joined with the spicy notes of cardamom.\nWhen you apply Kilian\u2019s Don\u2019t Be Shy perfume, you\u2019re hit with a refreshing orange blossom scent. Then after it sits on the warmth of your skin, the honeysuckle and rose fragrances make themselves known. But the best part? Your senses are graced with a touch of sweet marshmallow sugar accord. The floral scent feels both young and flirty, yet somehow also sophisticated. Plus, it looks really damn pretty on a vanity.\nGiorgio Armani\u2019s S\u00ed has been a fan-favorite for quite some time due to its alluring scent. It\u2019s floral and fruity and topped off with a lick of vanilla. But it\u2019s woody instead of being a candied vanilla-like aroma, so you\u2019ll get whiffs of a deeper and warmer scent instead of overt sweetness.\nAh, no best perfume roundup list would be complete without my personal favorite, the Viktor & Rolf Flowerbomb. You\u2019d think this fragrance would leave you smelling like an explosion of flowers because, well, that\u2019s how it\u2019s marketed. But lemme tell ya, it\u2019s much more complex than that. Sure, you get a beautiful jasmine and rose scent, but what makes it complex (and oh-so-yummy) is the subtle notes of patchouli and vanilla.\n I mean, can you blame me?! That\u2019s why when I discovered the Heretic Dirty Vanilla perfume, I was hooked. I can\u2019t lie, I was originally drawn to the name, but what really won me over? How it plays on sweet vanilla's darker side, thanks to the rich scents of amber, sandalwood, and spicy coriander. And alas, once I took a whiff of the warm woody notes, I discovered why it was given its name.\nIf you could bottle up the feeling of ~desire~ you\u2019d get Byredo\u2019s Slow Dance. Vanilla and patchouli anchor the base note of this scent, but you\u2019ll be hit with the smoky and creamy essence of amber and Labdanum. A touch of geranium adds a fresh note to balance and lighten up all the deeper scents.\nVanilla, rose, bergamot, white musks, and jasmine are combined to create this bright and fresh rose scent. If a woodier and deeper fragrance is not so much your thing, Lanc\u00f4me\u2019s classic Id\u00f4le perfume will give you that citrusy and floral scent.\nIf you\u2019re a fan of the sugary sweetness aromas found in a classic vanilla scent, give a warm hello to Vanilla Sky. Not only does it encompass everything cozy about your classic vanilla, but it\u2019s not too overt, making it an all-day wearable fragrance. It blends cappuccino, vanilla, and caramelized cedar to give you a yummy blend made with all clean ingredients.\nTo offset the overt sweetness often found in vanilla perfumes, this fragrance uses base notes of bamboo and sandalwood to accompany the creamy vanilla bean and cashmere notes. Plus, this bottle is pretty as hell.\nTorn by Henry Rose is the most perfect winter scent, IMO. Upon first application, you\u2019ll be hit with a strong, spicy aroma that soon transitions to smooth vanilla and sandalwood. This combination creates a scent that is earthy yet creamy.\nAh, no vanilla perfume list would be complete without Tom Ford\u2019s iconic Tobacco Vanille Eau de Parfum. The warm and rich combination of vanilla and tobacco creates the most sultry and powerful fragrance. However, I must note this scent is not for everyone. I like to compare the tobacco<|endoftext|>"

Taco Bell Canada re-released the brand's limited-edition Crunchwrapping Paper designed to look like Crunchwrap ingredients such as ground beef, nacho cheese sauce, a tostada shell, a soft tortilla, lettuce, tomato, and sour cream. However, this year the brand added a scent to the wrapping paper, which now smells and looks like a Triple Double Crunchwrap. As part of Chili's latest delivery promotion, customers had a chance to win a Baby Back Ribs-Scented Candle. For those who shared their experience and uploaded a photo of their delivered meals on social media and tagged Chili's, they were eligible for a \"starter pack,\" which contained the Baby Back Ribs-Scented Candle as well as a Doormat, TV Tray, Trivia Card Game, and a Chip Bag Clip. Qdoba Mexican Eats released a limited-edition Queso Candle, inspired by the brand's three-cheese queso.\nIn December, UK frozen food company Birds Eye, best known for its fish fingers, introduced AHOY! by Captain Birds Eye, a new fragrance for men. The fragrance was inspired by the \"hypnotic and evocative power of the high seas\" and \"is an aromatic scent reminiscent of a fresh ocean breeze, bursting with top notes of zingy grapefruit, sweet mandarin, and intoxicating patchouli.\" The limited-edition bottles were available through a Facebook competition.

According to brand, the bag's scent can last up to four years. Candy Couture California offers a collection of graphic, Scented T-Shirts such as Bacon, Coffee, and Race Fuel, which has \"sweet notes of motor oil and high performance gasoline.\" The T-shirts use a scent-infused gel, which \"gives off a delicate, mild smell - just enough to boost your mood\" and are said to last up to 15 to 20 washes.

        "passage": " the winter or spring time. Fields of poppies, bushes of broom covered in yellow flowers. Little coral houses with orange shingles, and of course vineyards everywhere. The Mediterranean ocean pops into view every once in a while and it\u2019s as blue as one can only hope.\nBeing here for a few days I\u2019m noticing a few things about the French (and I do hope this is not going to offend anyone), which come across quite obviously with smells: most people wear perfumes, and they wear good ones too. I\u2019ll be walking on the street and various scents, some familiar and some not cross my path. People here smell good. But than there was someone on the train who was wearing some baby-poweder smelling perfume and we had to put up with that for the entire ride, so I guess being around other perfumephiles comes at a price\u2026 On the other hand, there\u2019s a lot of smoking going on and you pass through clouds of smoke or need to put up with them in cafes and restaurants all the time. The toilettes are usually way cleaner than anywhere else I\u2019ve visited. There is almost always some good smelling hand soap, and more often than never there\u2019s even an air freshener. In fact, the metro stations are regularly sprayed with air fresheners, mostly smelling of lily of the valley (or lilac I\u2019m told too but I haven\u2019t smelled that yet). I don\u2019t know how they would\u2019ve smelled without the air fresheners, but I was told it used to be horrible.\nTowards the end of the train ride, I managed to finally et myself together and stop feeling sorry for myself (even though my ears are still ringing) and go freshen up with some of my mimosa perfume I was planning to wear in the south of France. We than enjoyed the last bit of macaroons we saved for the trip, whose flavours intensified because they were out of the fridge for several hours. The mango jasmine was so much more intense and just downright amazing; and the violet also came through a lot more clearly in the violet-cassis macarons. I also tried new flavours \u2013 Caramel Fleur de Sel, Lemon, Rose, Raspberry and the Orange Blossom, which is my new favourite (right next to the Bergamote and Mango-Jasmine).\nAfter another very short train ride to Grasse, leaving the beaches behind and heading towards the very beautiful mountain, we took a taxi to the hotel. Even the receipt of the taxi driver reeked of perfume. And so was nearly everything everywhere \u2013 a nice old fashioned floral perfume this or the other in every level at the hotel and everywhere there are little shops and perfume museums. The city looks very pretty and spreads wider than I would have ever imagined. It\u2019s a mountain city and the population here is far more diverse than you\u2019d expect from a small town \u2013 there\u2019s a huge Italian influence not only on the architecture but also the cuisine, and the population is not only French \u2013 there are North African Muslims, East Indians and Antilleans for examples (and restaurants to match as well). I was particularly thrilled to walk down the narrow streets and find little Arabic pastry shops selling all sorts of baklawa and Gazelle horns. It reminded me of the nearby Arab city to my village as well as other ancient mountain cities with the narrow swirling streets spilling over the mountains and staircases everywhere.\nToday was a sick day, the Jiboulee weather in Paris got the best of me (unequipped Canadian who expects anywhere else other than Canada to have better weather \u2013 I packed only summer clothes pretty much). I got up very late after trying to sleep off a head-cold or an upcoming flu and went to meet Denyse near the Palais Royal. We sat at a caf\u00e9 for a while talking mostly about the restrictions, regulations and legislation issues \u2013 a topic that one cannot get away from especially when in Europe*.\nThan strolled through the Jardin de Palais Royal to Serge Lutens. Being a weekend, the shop was buzzing with officially dressed sales clerks and customers. By serendipity we met Thierry \u2013 a Parisian perfume connoisseur who shocked me by telling me everything about my latest Paris travel post. I was not expecting to meet a SmellyBlog reader in Paris so that was a wonderful surprise!\nI tried too many Serge Lutens exclusives all at once: on my left writs Tubereuse Criminelle again, and on the upper side of that hand Sarasin. On my right wrist I tried and on top of the right hand Mandarine Mandarin, which starts like candied mandarin peel but ends up more like curry.\nCologne Blanc, Eau Sento No. 2, l\u2019Ether, l\u2019Ether (for the second time), and than Splash Forte (the one that smells like dessert).\nMy immediate favourite was l\u2019Ether, which smells mostly of geranium, myrrh and musk. I would have been happy to buy a bottle on the spot, but they come in a towering 1/2meter tall bottles or so, that seem impossible to operate. The candle collection is overwhelmingly beautiful albeit most of the smells reminded me of some of the outstandingly gorgeous Diptyque candles. I hope they will bring out again the Guimauve scent (marshmallow with strawberry and orange flower water) so this might be something to look forward to in a future Paris visit.\nIt was already the end of the day and shops gradually started to shut down. I was able to sneak into Penhaligon\u2019s before closing even though I wasn\u2019t planning on it \u2013 I just stumbled upon it. But unfortuantley I got to Colette just minutes after closing time (I really was hoping to get me some Kyoto and sniff other Comme des Garcons as well as Le Labo\u2019s line which aside from Vetiver 46 I\u2019m completely unfamiliar with) and also missed the big Annick Goutal on 14 Rue Castilligone (which was ok because I already smelled what I wanted to in St. Germain) - not to mention was not for the life of me even able to spot any clues as to the whereabouts of JAR. I will just have to go to Paris again and not get sick this time!\n* And just as an aside: Since I had many opportunities to discuss this in Grasse with working professionals, I am coming back to my original conclusion that the regulations are entirely se to eliminate any sort of competition for the big aromachemical houses: this is a double-sided sword that is set to a) make it extremely difficult for small, independent companies to survive thanks to a complex system of beaurocracy that is so labour intense it is only possible for large companies to comply with, having the means to develop elaborate software and have keep on their payroll a legistlation department and b) reduce if not eliminate completely (eventually) the production of natural raw materials. And even though synthetics are also becoming restricted, banned and so on this is not really a problem since it only creates more work for the chemical companies to develop new molecules to replace them.\nWe first headed out to Le Marais, an old neighbourdhood with narrow streets and Jewish population. My boyfriend insisted on showing me the falafel stands even though it would be the last place for me to eat while in Paris (I had to keep reminding him I am here for the macarons!). The falafel places were pretty close to the Israeli version, ran by loud Israelis of course who know how to make fast food fast. It was pretty good but I just tasted a little bit because I really do prefer the falafel back home and I can wait until than to have it. One thing to be said to their credit \u2013 they do use the proper pita bread (in Vancouver the pita bread is so think it\u2019s ridiculous \u2013 the so-called \u201cpita\u201d is rolled like a wrap and everybody is suppose to pretend it\u2019s ok).  After another mundane mission was accomplished (I had to buy a bag after the one I brought with me broke, sadly), we took the metro to St. Germain des Pres metro station.\nIt was again one of those terrible weather days when the weather couldn\u2019t make up it\u2019s mind. It repeated endless cycles of sunny-rainy-sunny-rainy etc. I was wearing l\u2019Ecume des Jours and feeling particularly moody. Searching for Pierre Herm\u00e9 we stumbled upon another Laduree location on Rue Bonaparte, where I bought some macaroons for later (the train ride to Grasse) and also some guimauve for my daughter. I was a bit disappointed \u2013 though not surprised - to learn that macaroons don\u2019t travel well; but since she loves marshmallows, I think the guimauve will be perfect \u2013 especially when they come not only in white (orange blossom) but also in purple (violet) and pink (rose). I guess I will have to learn how to make flavoured macaroons until I\u2019m able to take her with me to Paris again!\n For some reason, I was particularly attracted to a vanilla tart and also wanted to try a few macaroons: Pink Grapefruit, Mint, Jasmine, Cassis, Pistachio with a clove-soaked redcurrant in the middle, Rose, Passionfruit-Chocolate. We walked to the nearby square to sit and eat our newly found treasures. The macaroons were hopelessly amazing. We just had two to start with: the mint<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Scented candles are a nice touch to any home. Whether you want to create a romantic mood, calm yourself down after a stressful day at work, or simply want to enjoy a scent that you can\u2019t get enough of, there\u2019s a candle for almost any mood or occasion. Unfortunately, not all candles are created equal, as some have scents that don\u2019t last long while others burn too quickly. We\u2019ve picked 10 brands that make quality creations, and five of them are local brands we\u2019re proud of. Whether you\u2019re looking for candles for yourself or as a gift for a loved one, here\u2019s where you should go.\nThis British brand is one of the most popular names among fragrance lovers, be it in the form of colognes or candles. The range of candles are elegantly simple but create a lasting impression once you light them and inhale the scent. Pick something from their Home Collection and go for their signature fragrance, Lime Basil & Mandarin, if you\u2019re unsure of what to choose.\nOther options include the delicious-sounding Sweet Almond & Macaroon, the berry good Blackberry & Bay, or the oh-so-sensual Pomegranate Noir. For a more plush feel, pick a scent from the Luxury Candles selection, such as Wild Fig & Cassis or Peony & Blush Suede, which will give you up to 220 hours of burn time. And if you can\u2019t live without your calming candles, take them wherever you go, with something from the Travel Candles selection, featuring smaller candles with an 18-hour burn time.\nAvailable at various locations such as Tangs Orchard and Raffles City, check website for details. Visit www.jomalone.com.sg.\nThis French brand is one of the most established names in the market, boasting some of the most gorgeous scented candles you can find. The range is massive, with Classic Scented Candles, Small Scented Candles, Coloured Scented Candles, and Indoor-Outdoor Scented Candles. There are also some scented pillar candles, and you can build your own candle set too.\nGift sets are available too, with such pretty packaging that\u2019ll impress anyone. Bestselling scents include Baies (Berries), Feu De Bois (Wood Fire), and Figuier (Fig Tree). If you love their scents, there are diffusers and room sprays to try as well.\nAt Takashimaya Shopping Centre, 391 Orchard Road, #B1-33a Ngee Ann City, Singapore 238872, tel: 6732 0538. Visit www.diptyqueparis.com/en_us/.\nDon\u2019t judge these candles by their simple hand-blown jars, as the scents are something special. Ashley & Co is a brand from New Zealand that calls its candles \u2018waxed perfume\u2019 and we admit we love this moniker. All candles are individually hand-poured using 100 per cent natural biodegradable wax and an unbleached cotton wick.\nThere are only six scents to choose from at the moment but each of them has a name influenced by a story from each unique scent. For example, Parakeets & Pearls is an old-world scent that brings back the glamour of handwritten love letters and dressing for dinner, while Bubbles & Polkadots is a scent that resembles a baby out of a bath. The candles have a burn time of up to 50 hours and the same scents are available as diffusers too.\nAvailable at various locations such as Gallery & Co, Kapok Flagship Store and Red Dot Museum, check website for details. Visit https://ashleyandco.co/.\nWilliam Penhaligon launched this brand in London in 1870 and his work was so iconic that his recipe books are still consulted by the staff today. Both the packaging and the scents are elegant and all candles are hand-blended from naturally derived soy wax, and packed with essential oils.\nWith names such as Linen Cupboard and The Powder Room (from the Portraits collection) and Lily of the Valley and Samarkand (Classic collection), your room will be filled with some sublime aromas indeed. Being an English brand, the scent of tea plays a big part too, with a tea collection featuring luxury candles in three scents \u2013 Earl Grey, Assam and Neroli (Lady Grey). You could also get a Tea Collection Candle Box, with miniature candles of the three scents.\nAt #03-16 ION Orchard, 2 Orchard Turn, Singapore 238801, tel: 6634 1040 & 01-33/34, The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, 10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956, tel: 6688 7520. Visit www.penhaligons.com.\nEvery product is handmade on a farm in the English countryside of Devon and this British brand strives to support local and ethical suppliers. The 100 per cent natural candles are made with an innovative blend of plant waxes and the glass candle jars are gorgeous so remember to recycle them.\nThere are not many to choose from but this small outfit certainly knows how to let its goods do the talking. Delicate Romance is the brand\u2019s signature fragrance and is a feminine scent that\u2019s a symphony of roses laced with warm spices and citrus, while Sweet Lullaby feels like a \u2018hug in a bottle\u2019, a comforting scent with a blend of lavender and ylang ylang at its heart. They ship internationally so get on their website and place your order now. Visit https://lolasapothecary.com.\nRecognising the fact that we can\u2019t always control the circumstances of our daily lives, To Be Calm wants to help to create an atmosphere that calms our minds and embrace happy thoughts. The local brand hopes its fragrances evoke happy memories in our homes and offices, as well as those of our<|endoftext|>"

It's cosy, yes, but with a whiff of a New York boardroom. The atmosphere is a little stiff; a feeling of forced informality. It smells of fresh, strong black coffee and unwrapped Apple packaging - top notes of a perfume Diptyque might call L'Ambition. It's relaxed, but competitive.\nAway from the hotel's plush main buildings in a remastered old hay barn, Imran Amed - founder and editor-in-chief of the Business Of Fashion, or BOF for short, the highly regarded global portal for fashion news and analysis - stands assertively before his assembled guests to welcome them to Voices, the website's \"annual gathering for big thinkers\". Amed looks more than relaxed. He looks near beatific. Emotional even. This moment, after all, has been near ten years in the making.\nOver the next three days Amed - acting as he always does as part cross-industry cupid, part business guru - will introduce topics to the floor such as, \"What will the store of the future look like?\" and \"Why isn't the fashion industry more diverse?\" from a group of speakers as distinct as the rehabilitated fashion icon John Galliano, pop star turned tech head will.i.am, CEO of Gucci Marco Bizzarri, chief brand officer of Tommy Hilfiger, Avery Baker, and the first trans woman model to be signed by IMG Worldwide, Hari Nef. BOF's Voices conference is, to all intents and purposes, a supercharged TED seminar for style's global business elite. (Oh, and the supremely better dressed.) At the very nucleus of it all is Amed, smiling and spinning plates.\nSitting like diligent school children before their beaming, Puck-like host - some, I learn later, are nursing sore Negroni hangovers from the cocktail reception the evening before - the Voices' guests look up from their social feeds and listen to what this 42-year-old Canadian-British entrepreneur, dressed in a Sacai blazer, grey suit trousers and black Saint Laurent boots has to say.\nAmong the fashion illuminati with their ears pricked and their caret bars blinking in anticipation are influencers such as Dame Natalie Massenet, founder of Net-A-Porter and current chair of the British Fashion Council, Jos\u00e9 Neves, founder and CEO of Farfetch, supermodel Joan Smalls and chief digital officer of LVMH Ian Rogers. It's a crowd even the Met Gala's limousine line would gawp at.\nMake no mistake: although intrigued by the roster of top-tier speakers,<|endoftext|>"

The box includes shave cream (4 oz), soap (5 oz), body wash (30 oz), and a soy candle (6 oz) in the Boticario de Havana aroma (tobacco flower, bergamot, ylang ylang\u2026 more masculine than it sounds) $75 at Archipelago.

At Luckyscent I\u2019m happy to see a \u201cretro\u201d favorite, Rigaud candles (before Diptyque\u2019s arrival, these were almost the only option for high-end perfumed candles). Rigaud\u2019s Cypr\u00e8s candle (scented with lavender, pine, oak moss, cedar) is $65.

Aedes also sells Santa Maria Novella Wax Tablets to hang in closets or place in drawers (made with potpourri-scented beeswax), 2 tablets/$34.\nWhat would I want if my cats had credit cards and were able to use the Internet? Oh, not much, just the Guerlain Bee Bottle of Eau de Cologne Imp\u00e9riale, $320 for 17 oz (at Neiman Marcus), a Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle candle: Saint des Saints (Indian temple fragrance), Caf\u00e9 Society (Paris apartment) or Rosa rugosa, $85-$95 (all at Barneys New York). A travel box of four, 15 ml Czech & Speake V\u00e9tiver Vert fragrances (\u00a375) would be appreciated for future trips.\nAlas, my cats are on permanent sabbaticals and their budgets are tight; since I love the fragrant Italian drink chinotto, they could buy me a four-pack of Lurisia Il Nostro Chinotto ($16) or a couple six-packs of San Pellegrino Chinotto ($14) and I\u2019d be satisfied (all at Amazon.com).\nNote: Top image via Wikimedia Commons.\nMiddle images: left to right, Acqua di Parma Bergamotto di Calabria, Gabriel Boudier Cr\u00e8me de Cassis de Dijon, Astier de Villatte incense, Sea Salt soap.\nBottom images: left to right, Guerlain Eau de Cologne Imp\u00e9riale and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle Rosa rugosa candle.\nThe Dehli candle sounds divine!\nKindcrow: it is!\nMerlin\u2026I\u2019m betting I\u2019d get something fish scented.\nOk, Merlin, fess up!

But once we get along, I could be really cheerful and warm-hearted. Also, I am not as feminine or elegant as I appear to be, and that\u2019s probably why some of my friends find my personality contradictory to my appearance.\nHow would you choose your everyday perfume?\nI would choose something floral, woody and musk-like, as these are the more nature-inspired scents that soothe me, like how leaves and plants do.\nYou have a \"tree hole\" section on Instagram that allows you to interact with your followers on daily and emotional issues, so how did this idea come along?\nI love expressing sentiments in words. I've had some emotional issues before, and I\u2019m well aware of the pain in having nowhere to express yourself. With social platforms like Instagram, I try to help people by providing comfort the best way I can. A lot of people may tend to over-emphasise on the outcomes, which would easily lead to discouragement. I hope they can focus more on the process instead, which is often more valuable and inspiring.\n\nDuring my visit to Switzerland, there was a heart gladdening and refreshing smell from the snowy mountains, the coolness hovering in the air that mixed with the scent of sunshine filled me with warmth and nostalgia.\nThe scent of nature calms the mind, so the bergamot and sandalwood notes of LOEWE 001, the clean amber notes of Le Labo Ambrette 9 and the light post-rain scent of Le Labo Baie 19 would match with Zelia's idea to be appeased.

I plan to wear a lot of Etro Messe de Minuit and vintage Chanel No. 22 parfum over the holidays here in Philly.\nWhat a lovely giveaway! I would love to win a sample of Vanilla Smoke...it sounds amazing. The perfume I tend to wear the most around the holidays is Kenzo Jungle L'elephant as to me it has all the spice and magic of Christmas. My name is Celeste, and I thank you for this opportunity and also for your very fun blog.\nI will almost certainly be wearing Shalimar throughout the holidays.\nHow lovely! As the holiday season concerns, I think I might finally open the bottle of Mona di Orio's Vanille. My mother gave it to me on my 51th birthday and now the moment has come. And then there's always Nuit de Noel...\nThanks for the giveaway! Agreeing with Jennifer, this does sound like a great perfume for the holidays. Coco pure parfum is one that I think will work for holidays - warm, elegant and festive.\nAfter this, I'm going straight to the Aftelier website!

Happy Holiday season to all, and I enjoy reading what everyone is planning to wear. This post made me think and I decided I would lavishly use up some hoarded treasures. First will be Estee Lauder Private Collection and a partial purse spray of vintage Miss Dior (DARE I wear it to my office?). If those run out, I may go with some samples of incense and spice perfumes, which I love, but have to admit do not work as well for me as florals.\nI really love the original Bvlgari Omnia for the colder parts of the year.\nOooo, I am enthralled with the perfume already\u2026 and need some Lapsang, brandy, spiced cookies and a fireplace now as well!

These holidays, I plan to overdose on Lutens' MKK, mostly. I've decided to be brave and wear it to the big family christmas dinner - I don't care if it's risky, I want to feel comfortable. Other perfumes I hope to lean on to get me through the cold are Tauers Phi and Le Maroc pour Elle, both of which you are somehow partly responsible for: my addiction for all of Tauers rose-centered perfumes was set-off by reading your blog. My children are grateful - they love it.\nHmm - tough question! I'm thinking Shalimar PDT (or some vintage parfum if I can find another bottle - I lost mine!!)..Maybe some Chanel Coromandel, vintage Parfum sacre extrait, OJ Tolu, Aftelier Fig and Tango. It would depend on my mood, really..lol. Vanilla Smoke does sound perfect for the holidays.\nte quiero; te adoro; mi vida.\nporque son tu corazon y el mio.\nque tendran todo el calor de un beso.\nI'm wearing warm scents with nutmeg, vetiver, atlas sandalwood, vanilla, and some citrus notes!\nCurrently indulging my gourmand side with Kilian's Back to Black and L'Artisan Parfumeur Noir Exquis - an accidental fumble of one of the samples left my fingers doused and the two are amazing together! Tonka Imperiale is also satisfying the desire for a hay scent.\nYour description makes me want to wear THIS as my December scent! But really, Serge Lutens Ambre Sultan or Tauerville Incense Flash are my go tos recently. And Snake Oil from Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab, always Snake Oil! I'm ltrittipoe(at)yahoo(dot)com.\nOooh... I'll play! A circa-1970 Shalimar when I'm feeling naughty and Kenzo's King Kong when I'm feeling nice. Or is it vice versa...?\nHow fun! Thank you for the giveaway!

        "passage": "It\u2019s a real treat to have Duke of York Square on my doorstep and I can\u2019t think of a more perfect corner of London to while away the hours and make some important summery additions to my wardrobe.\nIf you\u2019re after some new bits and pieces for the summer season then you\u2019ll find everything you\u2019re after in Duke of York Square, with the added bonus of being able to fit in a cheeky food shop at Partridges (my very favourite!), afternoon tea at Gallery Mess (those scones!) or \u2013 if the sun puts its hat on \u2013 some of the most deliciously indulgent ice cream in our capital from Gelateria Valerie.\nI\u2019d start my summer shopping trip at Whistles where you can find some stunning two piece sets at the moment. Their prints are to die for this season and their forgiving take on the crop top works wonderfully with their matching A-line midi skirts \u2013 it\u2019s a superbly flattering look on most shapes and sizes, so don\u2019t be put off by the idea of a \u2018crop\u2019, we\u2019re only talking an inch of skin on show, if that. The stripe and tiger prints are my faves.\nYou may not consider going to All Saints for swimwear, but if you\u2019re after a cool bikini which is more grungey chic than OTT flower power, then they have some beautiful options. The hand embellished Nico bikini in gunmetal grey (\u00a376) is definitely worth a look.\nIf you\u2019ve got any garden parties or weddings to attend and you\u2019re after something that\u2019s not your usual high street fodder than you must head to Hoss Intropia, their dresses this season are so effortlessly chic. It\u2019s hard to pick a favourite, but definitely pay them a visit if you don\u2019t want to wear the same dress as three other attendees!\nSpeaking of more unusual dresses, Cos is where it\u2019s at for simple fabrics in interesting cuts. Their boat necklines are stunning and their sleeveless blazer dress (\u00a3150) is truly a thing of beauty!\nEveryone needs a pair of summer jeans and whilst I can only aspire to be sensible enough to wear white denim, those who can pull it off should look no further than Trilogy. They have lots of white denim in stock and plenty of Paige denim (from \u00a3185) if you want a truly perfect fit.\nKnitwear can be underrated in summertime but let\u2019s face it, we hardly enjoy 35 degrees day in, day out, here in the UK! Sarah Pacini is the place to head for lightweight knits in unusual cuts, they\u2019re great for layering and you\u2019ll no doubt rely on them more than you\u2019d expect!\nIf shorts are what you\u2019re after then ditch the classic denim cut offs and upgrade to something with a bit more style like the tailored offering in Banana Republic. I particularly like the white lace pair they carry (\u00a349.50), but the white eyelet pair (\u00a339.50) is great too.\nI highly recommend Zara for both summer sandals and summer flats, but you must go to L.K. Bennett if you\u2019re in the market for a pair of the slip on trainers that the fash pack are all excited about this season. I love their Berna skater shoes (\u00a3150) with shorts or turned up boyfriend jeans. Look out for the Whitley Bay canvas bag (\u00a395) if you\u2019re in L.K. Bennett too, English seaside nostalgia never looked so good!\nIt may not be fashion per se, but I can\u2019t go to Duke of York Square without popping into Space NK. Now is the time to visit too as all their suncare goodies have just arrived. I like to change to my summer staple perfume around this time of year and nothing says sunshine to me like the smell of Diptyque\u2019s Philosykos. Opt for the solid perfume (\u00a328) and then you don\u2019t have to faff about with small bottles when flying. Eve Lom\u2019s Kiss Mix is my summery lip balm of choice as it has sunscreen, UV protection and gorgeously tingly cooling menthol (\u00a316).\nAll this talk of shopping has me reaching for my credit card! I\u2019d love to see what you\u2019ve been buying at Duke of York Square this summer though, please tweet a pic to @PoppyD and @DOYSQ so I can see!<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " going out for a date or evening out with friends. This need has resulted in perfumes that have been existing for centuries. However, only in the last decades, we have seen major changes to what perfume entails. Back in the day, perfume was a luxurious product that was made with the finest ingredients. Perfumers did extensive research to find the best possible combinations. One of the greatest cinematic examples of this going a bit too far is Perfume: the story of a murderer. Of course, this is not a legitimate example for all the Perfumers out there who are still working around the clock to create niche perfumes. Before we dive in, we would like to make the distinction between niche and other perfumes.\nWhat do we mean with niche perfumes?\nDid you see how we moved from perfumes to niche perfumes? Good observation. There are noticeable differences when we look at perfume from over a century ago to those we see around us today. This difference started to emerge with the rise of premium clothing brands. These brands, known for their high-end fashion, started looking into other channels to generate revenues. This led them to introduce another luxurious product: perfume.\nThis is where we make the distinction between niche and perfumes of large multi-sector brands. Both suppliers utilize raw and natural products in their perfumes. The distinction becomes clear when we look at the quality of these raw materials. As niche perfumes are created in smaller amounts, there goes more time and effort in each specific perfume and the selection process of raw materials can be and is more strict and thorough. Whereas larger brands are focussed on mass production. Therefore, they will not have the selection process of raw materials for each perfume. Hence, the difference in quality between the perfumes, we only focus on niche perfumes.\nTo provide you with insight into the world of niche perfumes, we created an overview of top perfumes. Note that this list is non-exhaustive and that there are more brands out there that are worth giving a try. In this list, we looked at the most popular brands in the niche field.\nThe founder of this perfume, Frederic, has had a long history with perfume. You could argue that he was born with it. His grandfather was the founder of Parfums Christian Dior. This led to his interest in perfumes and pursuing a career as a professional evaluator and perfume critic. The result of his expertise can be found in the perfume brand Frederic Malle. For this brand, he works together with a broad set of Perfumers to create a differentiated set of perfumes. Good examples of this collection are Carnal Flower and Dries van Noten. Where Carnal Flower is a dark perfume, the Dries van Noten is warmer and can be seen as soft and tender.\nThe perfumes of Montale are relatively new, as they have been founded in 2003. Having its home base in Paris, Piere Montale spent time in Saudi Arabia, working as a Perfumer for the nobility. Here, he learned about the highest quality of natural ingredients and found his passion to combine these Arabian scents with the scents of the Western world. This led to the collection that Montale has brought to the world of perfume.\nThe first perfume on the list (but not the last) that originates from Italy. Founded in Turin, this is a brand that should already be bought for their bottles. The company is using quartz stones to develop their bottles, combined with other precious materials to give them a luxurious appearance. Perfumes of Xerjoff make use of a broad range of flowers such as jasmine, the Bulgarian rose, and iris, combined with fruity scents. Perfect perfumes for dinners or a beautiful day in spring. They are inspired by many holiday locations in Italy which people around the globe love to visit, and incorporate those in their perfumes.\nThis can be considered a unique brand when looking at its foundation. As a Swedish brand, it stands out from the (limited) Scandinavian offerings in the world of perfume for so many reasons. The founder, Ben Gorham, has roots in both India and Canada and tries to take this with him when developing perfumes. Just like himself, he tries to bring together the Indian scents with Western characteristics. This makes Ben travel the world to find the best possible ingredients for his scents. These all come together in Sweden, where his perfumes and bottles are still assembled by hand.\nAnother brand that is developing niche perfumes and is founded in the beautiful scenery of Rome, Italy. Founded in 2003, this brand has been embedding craftsmanship with the capital C into its products. Maurizio Lembo started the brand by developing scents that combine his childhood memories with new insights he retrieves from different sources. This resulted in a portfolio of twelve unique perfumes that all come with their unique scents. Packed in a luxurious and minimalistic bottle, this is a gift you should treat others (and yourself) with.\nWant to wear something extraordinary? Diptyque can be the brand for you. Known for its uniquely sophisticated scents, it is home to a loyal fan base of users. It can be purchased among the world\u2019s most exclusive retailers as an exclusive brand and comes in a simple yet refined bottle. Ranging from the Eau des Sens to the Orph\u00e9on, these perfumes have a long history and unique scent.\nFrancis can be seen as a perfumer who has seen it all. When graduating from the perfume school of Versailles, he invented the Le Male scent for Jean Paul Gaultier. To this day, this is one of the most famous perfumes sold across the globe. After leaving Jean Paul, he worked at many other fashion houses to create perfumes. However, at a certain point, Francis thought it was time to give his perfume a shot. He founded Maison Francis Kurkdijan and started making exclusive perfumes that are appreciated across the world.\nWhen you look at the bottle of this brand, you might feel that you are going back to the Wild West. Having old-school typography on its bottles, the brand originates from the UK. This is the place where William Penhaligon started the first barbershop of the country back in the 17th century. Since then, they have been developing perfumes for their clients as well. The materials are of the highest quality and are very expensive, resulting in a unique perfume that is made in England.\nThe last niche perfumer on the list is Creed, another brand that is founded in Britain. Around the same time as Penhaligon\u2019s, James Creed started the perfume brand. The brand became well-known and supplied to the royal families across the island. The perfumes that are made by Creed are still made by hand. This does not only hold for the pressing, but also the weighing, mixing, and filtering. This makes the perfumes more expensive, but also more exclusive. The average bottle sold by Creed starts around 300 US dollars. Does this mean it is worth it? You could inquire at Queen Victoria if you are interested, she is a big fan of the brand and owns several of their perfumes.\nAre direct-to-consumer brands here to stay?<|endoftext|>"

In addition to housing an office, the basement is also a VIP lounge with raspberry walls and a large sofa upholstered in cinnamon raw linen behind a Thirties vintage Perspex coffee table.\nBecause of its previous owner, the store didn\u2019t need an entire interior overhaul. \u201cIt sold antiques, so it didn\u2019t have a modern look or feel to it, which is perfect for Diptyque,\u201d said Delafon. \u201cIt also saved us having to make any drastic changes, which worked in our favor financially and time wise.\u201d Delafon added the store should reach $395,000, or 250,000 pounds, in its first year at retail.\nIt took just 2 1/2 months for the location to have the Diptyque stamp on it, with the help of interior designer and Delafon\u2019s friend, Henry Chebaane, whose previous projects have included London\u2019s Hempel Hotel and the spa at the Berkeley Hotel.\n\u201cWe tried to replicate the store on Saint-<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "I\u2019m starting to view my life in This is Us style flashbacks. Two years ago, I boarded an early flight to Minneapolis, filling out Drake-themed valentines on board for my friends. I was out of town for the weekend but was enjoying texting with a guy I\u2019d yet to meet. Tonight, I expected to be home watching the Valentine\u2019s Day episode of This is Us (and totally crying, because every week without question it happens) but my boyfriend has other plans. I have no idea where we are going but I suspect it might be the spot where we had dinner together for the first time almost two years ago. Life is crazy and love is wild and I\u2019m getting swept up in the emotion of it all.\nToday is special because we say it is. Not because it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day but also appreciating that this is the time of year our story began. Scent is the most powerful memory trigger so this week, I resurrected a favorite fragrance of mine that happens to be what I was wearing two years ago. I could not get enough of Diptyque Vetyverio \u2013 I wore it nonstop. I am certain I wore it exclusively the first six months of our relationship. I don\u2019t hear enough about this fragrance and that\u2019s actually fine by me. I like being different. You all can have your Santal 33 and Gypsy Water (j/k \u2013 I totally need some Byredo in my life) Vetyverio is the ultimate masculine meets feminine perfume with the earthy, woodsy vetiver and a burst of floral bouquets. I get a wave of rose and when it dries down, there\u2019s a spice to it that clings to my skin. I feel sexy wearing this perfume. And every time I get a whiff, I remember so vividly falling in love. I don\u2019t take that for granted.\nAin\u2019t no party like a 312 Beauty (re)launch party! But not because it doesn\u2019t stop. It\u2019s because we have candles and Social!\nIf you\u2019re local, I hope you\u2019ll come join me at diptyque for a special soiree on November 4. There will be plenty of my new favorite sparkling bev to toast with and treats and raffles from diptyque. It\u2019s always a good night when I can step away from the internet and interact with you in real life! Swing on by and we\u2019ll all collectively swoon over diptyque\u2019s new holiday collection. The fun starts at 5pm. See ya there?\nOne of the most beautiful boutiques in all of Chicago is certainly diptyque in Bucktown. And, ya know, it happens to smell pretty nice in there, too. I stopped in there a few weeks ago to peek at the new 34 Collection, an homage to the original diptyque at 34 Saint Germain in Paris. The vibe was different, in a good way. I was surprised to see colorful and vibrant patterns of cards and notebooks, fragrance diffusers shaped as birds, a marbled clay candle, bronzed candle holders and the most perfect vintage-esque bottle of perfume that looked like it could have been plucked from Catherine Deneuve\u2019s vanity in the 60s. Note on the latter \u2013 in prepping for this collection, they went on a massive treasure hunt to source the bottle and found one of the only master glassmakers in France still working traditionally by hand. The collection \u2018Le Bazar\u2019 is a modern take on diptyque\u2019s market-like beginning. Before I even stepped in the boutique I was welcomed by the scent of the Le Redoute candle, a reincarnation of the potpourri filling the air on opening day at 34 Saint Germain. Like most diptyque candles, it\u2019s a bold aroma that can envelop your entire home immediately. This is a good thing \u2014 I put it to test at my house! It\u2019s a cozy woodsy scent made of cinnamon, clove, orange, rose, cedar and amber. The mat porcelain exterior is special, albeit a departure from the diptyque aesthetic I love so much. Each candle is made by hand using a mixed clay method which makes them all one-of-a-kind. But really, it\u2019s the stories and creativity behind every item in this collection that stands out.\nHow do you apply your perfume? I\u2019ve always been a spray through the air and walk through it kind of girl, which the lovely ladies at Diptyque informed me is the French way. Instantly my haphazard ways are Parisian chic! A few weeks ago, I visited the Bucktown Diptyque boutique\u2014 always a wonderful treat for the senses. I was in search of a new perfume and let my nose lead the way.\nDiptyque approaches the scent selection, be it home or personal, in a very experiential manner. Starts with a chat on your likes and dislikes and continues with a \u201clast man standing\u201d style smell test. No worries if you don\u2019t know your scent profile \u2014 mine is admittedly vague and ADD. They have a way of challenging your instincts and introducing you to notes you didn\u2019t even know you would like. I am all rose all the time, but my favorite candle is Baies (it\u2019s actually the top seller) and I\u2019m wildly attracted to the Vetyverio perfume. OK\u2026yes, both of those have rose, but vetiver in its pure form is a rooty, earthy scent. Turns out, I love it.\nBecause it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day and I adore you all, I\u2019ve got a giveaway courtesy of of the Diptyque Bucktown team!\nIf you\u2019re in Chicago (or plan to travel to Chicago!), Diptyque is inviting one of you to come in and pick out a candle of your choice from the classic collection. Leave me a comment by Sunday 2/23 and I\u2019ll pick at random!\nAlso, I\u2019ve got a mini Rose candle and Eau de Rose sampler set to give to away as well.<|endoftext|>"

First, there\u2019s a trio of sculptural fish that serves as a light fixture for the lobby that has been designed by renowned architect Frank Gehry. Then there\u2019s the fan\u2014a signature of the brand and an item that\u2019s uniquely created for each hotel\u2014that was created by Tim Yip, the Oscar Award\u2013winning art director for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Made from silk and paper, dried plant leaves and grass have been embedded into the fabric to evoke a sense of nature. And to highlight the ethereal quality of the fan, the blades have been made from silicon instead of traditional bamboo.\nThe sumptuous quarters have floor-to-ceiling windows and oversize marble bathrooms. Rooms start at 592 square feet and go up to 2,799 square feet with the Presidential Suite, which boasts an even larger terrace to relax on.\nEvery little detail has been carefully considered to help guests feel comfortable and at home, including the blue Wedgwood tea sets, Vera Wang glassware, Ploh goose down bedding, Dyson hair dryers (humidifiers and air purifiers from the appliance company are also available on request), Diptyque toiletries, Marvis toothpaste, and Toto toilets.\nFinally, (since March 2019) the installation of a scent system by Scent Company to diffuse a Signature Scent made-to-measure for the hotel, to welcome guests immediately at the entrance of the building and accompaying them inside the structure wrapped in an almost imperceptible cloud of sweet perfume.\nNext Next post: Is there a scent that reminds you of Summer?<|endoftext|>"

You can see all of these posts and other beauty faves in the \u201cBeauty\u201d category of CBL!\nClarisonic Mia FIT (on sale through Sunday!): I\u2019ve been a longtime lover of Clarisonic. My mom gave me one yeeeeaarrrsss ago that I continue to use, but it\u2019s on its last leg and this little lady arrived just in time for a fresh start! I like to use my device 1-2x a week to really get a good scrub on my face and neck. Nothing cleans your face like a Clarisonic.\nThayers Witch Hazel: I call my sister \u201cinner hippie,\u201d and she has lots of natural tips and tricks that I\u2019ve shared interest in (more about my guru sister here!). For my birthday she put together a package of some of her favorite things and this was one of them. I use it as a toner, and I have to say\u2026 it smells amazing.\nOribe Texturizing Spray: I\u2019ve heard so many girls rave about this product so I knew I wanted to try it out! I really love the scent, and it acts as a dry shampoo but I think it also helps add volume. I don\u2019t use it as often as I\u2019d like because it is expensive, but it\u2019s good stuff (better than my usual drugstore dry shampoo pickup).\nDiptyque Rose Lotion: Also a little on the pricey side for a lotion, but I save this lotion for date nights or special occasions and it smells intoxicating. You can\u2019t go wrong with Diptyque candles or scents \u2013 they are phenomenal.\nL\u2019Oreal Purify and Mattify Clay Mask: Is there anything better than a hot shower, fluffy robe, face mask and glass of wine? That is literally my mecca. This mask smells like a visit to the spa and I love love love it. L\u2019Oreal has a new collection of face masks and while they are all amazing, this one is my favorite!\nKate Somerville Moisturizer: I\u2019ve loved Kate Somerville from the first time I tried it, and their cleanser and moisturizer is one of my favorites for everyday. They\u2019re luxe and nourishing but not as heavy as most intense moisturizers. I visited their salon in Beverly Hills a month or so ago and it was the most fabulous facial I\u2019ve ever had. If you have a chance to visit \u2013 I can\u2019t recommend it enough!\nFirst Aid Beauty: Another skincare brand I really love (their SPF is my go-to), I\u2019ve been trying their Illuminating Moisturizer and it has a little shimmer that\u2019s really pretty for daytime. I also love this hydrating serum of theirs, and I use it before applying face lotion.\nLe Labo Solid Perfume: I\u2019ve never tried a wax perfume, but this tiny container packs a lot of fragrance and it\u2019s cruelty-free and vegan (which I extra love). They have all kinds of fabulous scents, and I\u2019ve been wearing the Santal 33 which is gender-neutral (I love a masculine scent), and this one has some sandalwood. So good!\nI warned you guys this was a long one! Scroll down for my beauty picks!\nUrban Decay: You guys know I have a love history with UD, and their fall lineup packs a serious color punch. They have a new collection of liquid liners that is beyond fabulous (I love a liquid liner), and their one-and-done complexion cream is one of my favorites this summer. They\u2019ve also recently released some color correcting liquids and I LOVE them!\nPixi MultiBalm: I have this lip balm in several colors, and I\u2019m really loving it! My favorites are the Baby Petal and Wild Rose, and I usually layer it with a lipgloss.\nT3 Whirl Trio: I had seen so many beauty girls using this wand, and I wasn\u2019t convinced it was any better than the wands I have.

This elegant and nostalgic fragrance evokes memories of the past with the wonderful and enticing scent of sandalwood.\nWhile its top notes consist of rosewood, myrtle and cypress, the middle notes come from Goa sandalwood. The base notes are drawn from cedar and expertly combined with the rest of the perfume. It leaves one with a green, sharp and luxurious scent that is sure to help the mind and body revive and relax.\nThe perfume is utterly distinctive and feels like a stroll through an Asian jungle or a tropical rainforest. To enjoy the optimal benefits of this relaxing aroma, just apply on the pulse points and feel enraptured by the fragrance.\nGive in to the unique experience of Diptyque Eau De Toilette Tam Dao, an enriching sandalwood scent that gently mixes with floral and green notes to help relax the body and mind.\nTam Dao Eau de Toilette is rated 4.6 out of 5 by 13.\nRated 5 out of 5 by LolaG from Unisex I really love unisex fragrances, but not a fan of sandalwood, but this is wonderful! Its balanced (as in all the notes compliment each other) and stays on for quite some time, well on my skin anyway. However, it is not my signature scent. I prefer citrus or floral notes, which this is not the case here.\nRated 3 out of 5 by beautylover from Nice Sandalwood Scent, Doesn't wear long I got this in the Space NK holiday edit set. I was excited to try my first Diptyque perfume and I was a little disappointed. It's a slightly spicy unisex scent, which I like but don't love. The issue is I feel it's gone on my skin pretty quickly. My Le Labo perfume lasts all day but this is gone on me in 2 hours or so. I don't think I'd rebuy.\nRated 5 out of 5 by josephact from Calming woody scent This is one of the woodiest fragrances I have ever worn. Really distinctive while being able to keep a low profile. Definitely recommended as a signature scent for men. Duration is limited, however, and do keep in mind that the EDP smells a bit different than the EDT.<|endoftext|>"

It embodies the creative freedom and eclecticism that are the hallmarks both of Diptyque and of its original address.\nFormerly only available in extra large size, 34 boulevard Saint- Germain candles now also come in the two iconic smaller formats. On the one hand, the medium size candle, its pot a translucent, opaline white, contains the emblematic oval rendered in toneon- tone. On the other, the large candle, with its engraved white biscuit pot and its three wicks, progressively releases the notes of the signature scent. Meanwhile, the limited edition 34 boulevard Saint-Germain scented oval \u2013 ideal for fragrancing small spaces such as drawers, closets and other enclosed places.\nFor a diffusion method that is both original and poetic, the hour glass in the 34 Collection allows the owner to enjoy the uniqueness of the iconic fragrance in their immediate surroundings for the space of an hour. Meanwhile, the home fragrance diffuser, designed to perfume large spaces on a long-term basis, allows it to unfold over time. Thanks to this beautiful object, designed in a perfect Diptyque oval, it is now entirely possible to savour the 34 experience non-stop in your own home.<|endoftext|>"

I don\u2019t know what the \u201csilver\u201d is, here, but I suspect it is a light musk. With it wafting up on the breezes as I took a spring hike, it gave a charming impression of a bouquet of carnations. Even the sappy greenness of the cut stems was there to my nose.\nVillainess\u2019 Grundy (which I wanted to love): mulch, moss, dandelion sap, daisies, weeds, soil.

Eventually it mellowed into something interesting but very Not Me.\nPossets\u2019 Haute Love: very successfully evokes crystallized ginger dipped in milk chocolate. Unfortunately, Possets\u2019 chocolate scents do not flourish well on my skin and take on unbearable levels of mixed syrup and skank for a bit. Your mileage may vary \u2013 I know many people love them.\nPossets\u2019 Id, Ego, and SuperEgo: lavender and chocolate at the heart, with different balances and embellishments. These are interesting, but may be based on too ambitious a contrast for my taste.\nMy nose and brain are not working because of the flu. Sorry, no review today. Please come back tomorrow when we will be back to business as usual. And have a great week, everybody!\nThe shining starpower of Chayaruchama a.k.a. Ida Meister a.k.a. La Perumista Par Excellence is easily measured by the fact that I came to know and crave her presence simply by reading her comments on other people\u2019s blogs. They leapt off the screen: puns and slightly dirty jokes, sophisticated allusions to books and movies, sideways glances at perfumes and perfumers that hinted at a great depth and breadth of knowledge, and huge dollops of motherly love, all of it dancing down the page in a series of her trademark exclamatory lines. Later, I came to know a bit more about her, and realized that she was a kind of one-woman missionary for perfume\u2014cultivating and encouraging independent perfumers, championing a good bargain, spreading the scented gospel wherever she went.\nI know I\u2019m not the only who\u2019s wondered \u2013 who is this woman? So, dear readers, with y\u2019all as my excuse, I sent a series of nosy emails to Chaya (Chaya is her Hebrew given name\u2014Ida, the English approximation of its pronunciation) and she generously answered them. It would be easy to write a book about Chaya\u2014maybe two\u2014so I\u2019ve split the post into two parts: Today, Part I, in which it is clear that a passion for beauty and knowledge can be inborn, and can grow and thrive in spite of all adversity. Next up: Part II, a portrait in scent.\n\u201cHe was an inspiration. A holy man masquerading as a regular Joe, an immigrant who made his way the hard way\u2014a man of few words (many of them profane), infinite mercy, love, and action. \nThose of you who know Chaya later became a nurse will see some heavy foreshadowing here. But though she loves her work, nursing was only a practical fourth choice dream\u2014one that would get her out of New York and assure her economic independence. Chaya declined a scholarship to the Cornell school for veterinary medicine, and opportunities to study languages and music: early and continuing passions rivaling her love of perfume.\nShe\u2019s not done yet: \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to accommodate vocabulary in Sanskrit (from yoga and out of intense curiosity), and in some Asian languages, where I have NO knowledge base\u2026\u201d She regrets never learning ancient Greek, in which she hoped to read the ancient classics, and, perhaps a bit more, listening to her family when they told her she wasn\u2019t bright enough to achieve one of her early goals\u2014working as a translator at the U.N. I can only dream of how Chaya\u2019s presence might have furthered international relations.\nI've always sung; my entire family loved to sing\u2014both sides. The story goes\u2026 that my mother awoke in the middle of the night to music. She thought she had left the radio on. I was found sitting on the carpet in my room, singing the chorale from Beethoven's Ninth to myself in German.  I was supposedly three-years-old at the time.\nI craved singing lessons very early on, but the conventional wisdom of the time was\u2014not until the onset of puberty. My mother mistakenly promised me lessons as soon as my menses began. At 11 \u00bd I came home from school, thrilled that I could NOW have lessons! Reaching womanhood was a paltry second, for me.\nI sang for years, but it wasn't until I had had truly life-threatening events, that the encouragement started coming in. I worked with Eleanor Steber, Boris Goldovsky, and the lovely late Lorraine Hunt-Lieberson. By the time I was finally being noticed, survival was a more urgent issue.\nI met Bernhard on December 19, 1982 at 1:30 pm in Harvard Square, in a snowstorm.\nThe old Coffee Connection\u2014now, a Starbuck's. I was catching my breath, en route to the third grocery store, in order to prepare a Yugoslavian peasant meal for my roommate. Having a French press of Sumatran Mandheling with a pate/ cheese board.\nI was carrying about 80 lbs. of groceries to the \u201cT\u201d [subway] and wearing precious little clothing (mostly, a red charmeuse camisole, green velvet hiphuggers, English riding boots, waist-length dark hair, and Mitsouko).\nI wasn't looking for a date, and he was unemployed.\nHe gallantly insisted upon driving me to Whole Foods, then home.\nI cooked for him, fed him, made him laugh, walked him around Castle Island in the blizzard at 2 am, made him tea, told him stories, and finally gave in and slept with him...\nAnd he didn't wait very long to ask me to marry him.\nI ask you, dear readers, who would?\nIt's rather a crazy week here in Lake Pansy (apologies to Garrison) so this isn't going to be a terribly long post. Lucky you!\nThis past weekend Andy Tauer made an appearance for the formal introduction of Incense Rose. I was able to speak to the Robin, IrisLA and Supermarky, and to meet Maria B, who motored all the way down from Monterey for the occasion (clever girl that she is, she took the super-scenic coast road, which everyone should do once).\nAndy gave a talk about the development of his frankincense/rose scents and showed us various components; it's always interesting to be able to see how some of these disparate (and sometimes shockingly pungent) ingredients can some up with something as smooth and seductive as Incense Rose, whose play on citrus-tinged roses, coriander and incense is a beauty, even if I do find it a little more rose than I like to wear. If you love garden-fresh rose and are in the mood for a wonderful spring scent you will definitely want to check this out.\nHe also gave out samples of his new Rose scent, which will apparently debut in the fall. It's the other side of the calendar from Incense Rose: IR is playful spring, buzzing with the promise of life. Rose is the last blooms of autumn, the Indian summer days with that \"migrate-or-die\" evening chill toit.\nAndy also gave us a sniff (via test strips- he only had one little sample) of his new Vetiver, which I don't remember him saying when (or if, for that matter) it would be out. Being the shy, retiring thing that I am, I sidled up to the bar and Baldly, er, politely gave myself the tiniest spritz. Yum! It's vetiver, but it's doing that same \"rethink what you know about vetiver\" Andy has done with lavender with Reverie au Jardin and with hyacinth with Hyacinth and Mechanic (No Andy, I am not letting that one go. So there.). I REALLY hope that this one sees the light of day, the shelves at LuckyScent and the inside of my cupboard. Had I had a third glass of prosecco I would have just grabbed the sample out of Franco's hand and ran drunkenly off with it. Luckily, for decorum's sake, I did not.\nDiptyque is one of the houses that, for some unforgivable reason, I tend to overlook in my never-ending search for the exotic and the unusual. And I really shouldn't, because the company has created some of the most interesting fragrances, comparable in their uniqueness to some of the weirdest Lutenses or SIPs, and some even surpassing these universally acknowledged masters of the odd.\nTake Eau Lente, for example. Said to be inspired by the times of Alexander the Great, it is a spicy perfume extraordinaire. The spices, of which cinnamon is one and cumin, I would swear, is another, rest on a pillow-soft, powdery-sweet opoponax base, and the<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " geranium for an incredibly alluring scent that evolves as the day goes on.\nAccording to Ex Nihilo, Fleur Narcotique is far and away their bestselling perfume, calling it \u201can overdose\u201d of energetic ingredients that leave \u201ca trail of sensual peony wrapped in woods.\u201d The scent\u2019s floral notes of jasmine, orange blossom and of course, peony, play a starring role, while transparent wood, moss and musk add warm undertones for a scent that is, indeed, a blissful narcotique.\nUnapologetically seductive, Smoke Show is a spicy, woody scent and hands down the one to reach for when you\u2019re looking to make a striking statement. Some say it has an opulent, \u201cGatsby-esque\u201d sensibility, likely due to the masculine notes of leather, vetiver, cedarwood and agarwood, yet it is lightened with a touch of feminine rose oil, creating a scent that is as mysterious as it is refined.\nArguably one of the most famous perfumes in the world, Angel by Mugler is the brainchild of beloved fashion designer, Thierry Mugler, who, according to legend, wanted to create a delicious, mouthwatering scent for the women lucky enough to wear his designs. The scent\u2019s makeup is more complicated than a single whiff may seem, with 28 blissfully fragrant notes in total. The most fragrant top notes kick off with a sweet pairing of cotton candy and juicy citrus, mixed with a heart equal to a lush fruit basket filled with red berries, blackberry, plum and peach, ending with a base of chocolate, vanilla, caramel and sandalwood.\n\u201cThe way that we work on composing fragrance, it\u2019s really about celebrating a specific story that we\u2019re trying to capture from our founders,\u201d Valadez says. This light, floral eau de toilette recalls the beloved memories of Diptyque founder Yves Coueslant\u2019s childhood summers in Do Son, Vietnam. Brewed with spicy tuberose, softened with orange blossom and topped with jasmine, this women\u2019s perfume is simultaneously light and potent, making it a terrific option for the workplace.\nIf happiness could be bottled up, it might look (and smell like) like Daisy by Marc Jacobs. Effervescent, full-bodied and straightforwardly sweet (think honey-sweet, not cupcake-sweet), this perfume for women emphasizes crisp fruits and dreamy florals. You\u2019ll find notes of strawberry, violet and jasmine offset with the teensiest touch of sultry sandalwood. Plus, this smooth scent can easily be mixed, matched and layered with other scents if you want to play master perfumer.\nChances are, you\u2019ve smelled this incredibly popular unisex Le Labo fragrance at least a few times a week just walking around your city. It smells like a roaring fire with billows of thick smoke \u2014 spiked with a cocktail of cardamom, iris and violet notes \u2014 to present the most intoxicating, can\u2019t-get-enough kind of scent.\n\u201cI have 67 fragrances at home, so it is really hard to choose a favorite,\u201d laughs Barry. \u201cBut a go-to is Atelier Cologne Oolang Infini. It\u2019s a clean tea and skin scent, but has a smoky Gaiac wood base to round out a multilayered finish that evolves throughout the day,\u201d he adds.\n\u201cI am really loving Ralph Lauren Ralph\u2019s Club right now for fall,\u201d says Barry of this herbaceous aroma of cedarwood, patchouli and lavandin. Forget the \u2018men\u2019s fragrance\u2019 label \u2014 plenty of women wear \u201cmasculine\u201d scents when they want to feel powerful.\nLost Cherry, one of the best Tom Ford perfumes for women, is a beautiful masterpiece of contradictions: A cocktail of decadent black cherry and bitter liqueur are infused with Turkish rose and Arabian jasmine to offer an explosion of warm and spicy notes, creating a full-bodied perfume intended to provoke imagination and sensuality.\nDesigned for both men and women, one of Byredo\u2019s best-selling fragrances conjures a fantasy of walking through an old, beautiful library, complete with aromatic wood panels and tables, musty old paper and books with rich leather bindings. All of these elements create a luxury fragrance that is simultaneously comforting and exciting.\nAh, the perfume for the people who don\u2019t wear perfume. Everything about this perfume is different down to the way it\u2019s formulated, ensuring that it smells literally like no other perfume out there. Skipping the standard notes process, this perfume is made of just one ingredient, cetalox, which smells like the Earth \u2014 but not dirt or trees, per se. Just try it and you\u2019ll see what we mean.\nOne of Shapiro\u2019s favorites, this \u201cmarvelous fragrance,\u201d as she calls it, has an ambery sensibility with strong notes of clove, sandalwood, musk and amber. It\u2019s balanced with smooth vanilla and lavender that perfumer Maurice Roucel designed to be sensual, dramatic and mysterious.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just stunning,\u201d enthuses Shapiro about the sexiest perfume on our list. \u201cIt\u2019s vanilla, but it\u2019s so sophisticated and intoxicating.\u201d Shapiro\u2019s rousing endorsement should surprise no one, because if Tom Ford understands one thing, it\u2019s how to be sexy and dripping with confidence. Spritz on this supercharged scent when you need to remember all the power you wield.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s best to throw the whole idea of specific notes out the window,\u201d Shapiro says. \u201cInstead, think of what mood you want to be in. Is it warm and cozy? Is it effervescent and flirty? Then, seek out scents with that same vibe. You may find something that surprises and enchants you.\u201d And that goes for this fragrance, too \u2014 it feels mysterious and thrilling, as if you\u2019re vacationing somewhere on the other side of the world or tasting a new, exotic dish. It\u2019s one of the best oud perfumes around.\nInspired by a gift from his grandparents \u2014 a papyrus covered in hieroglyphs \u2014 perfumer Alexis Dadier set out to capture the refreshing and smoky papyrus scent for Chlo\u00e9. The result is a dry, gently woody women\u2019s perfume, offset with verdant, lush notes, that\u2019s light enough for daytime wear and can easily be layered for a sultry evening scent. All in all, it\u2019s one of the best perfumes for young women in their 20s.\nCaptivating and simple, this scent is one of the best women\u2019s perfumes for a minimalist who just wants to smell great and a little neutral. Blackcurrant nectar, mandarin and orange blossom are at the forefront, with warm vanilla anchoring the fragrance and rounding everything out. The fruit and vanilla combo is pretty and easy to wear.\nA longtime favorite among beauty editors, this essence features an extravagant mingling of floral, amber and woody notes, resulting in one of the best long-lasting perfumes that is truly intoxicating, memorable and timeless.\n\u201cI love the idea of fragrance bringing joy,\u201d Shapiro says. \u201cThere is magic in our sense of smell; it can literally stop and seemingly reverse time with just a sniff. It can also open up a whole new world \u2014 an invisible one, for sure \u2014 but so powerful all the same.\u201d Everyone knows what mint smells like, but this Diptyque perfume for women turns that notion on its head with a reimagined take, resulting in a lively, thoroughly modern \u2014 and definitely joyful \u2014 geranium and patchouli-infused mint.\nWhere and how you spray perfume is everything. To ensure your scent lasts all day, spritz directly onto the skin. Don\u2019t do the spray-then-walk-into-it thing \u2014 all that will do is waste your expensive perfume.\nFocus on the pulse points, which are the warmest parts of your body, with the go-to spots being the wrist and neck. However, there are plenty of other lesser-known areas that will maximize your perfume\u2019s longevity and intensity, like behind the ears and in the elbow creases.\nFragrance also attaches best to hydrated skin, which is one more reason to moisturize regularly and in humid climates (and is also the reason why everything smells a little bit more in the summer, for better or worse).\nEduardo Valadez is a self-described perfume junkie who has more than 20 years under his belt working at the storied French fragrance house, Diptque. He\u2019s had a front-row seat to every new fragrance development and launch at the brand and he possesses an almost encyclopedic knowledge of the fragrance world.\nRoss Barry serves as the national perfume artist for Aterlier Cologne. Barry is light years ahead of the curve when it comes to predicting and crafting fragrance trends. He inherently understands the power of perfume, especially the notes and combinations that make us tick.\nBee Shapiro: Shapiro is the best kind of multi-hypenate: Style writer at the New York Times and founder of Ellis Brooklyn, the clean perfume house with a delightful range of aromas that we simply can\u2019t get enough of.\nLaura Slatkin is a former Wall Street exec who ditched the stock market for fragrance, launching the beloved brand, Nest New York. What started as exclusively a luxury home fragrance line, Slatkin oversaw the company\u2019s mete<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "When I first smelled Cuir Velours and Bois d'Ascese, the debut duo of fragrances by Julien Rasquinet for Naomi Goodsir, Bois d'Ascese was the clear front runner. It seemed a no brainer (wood, smoke, fifty shades of burnt). Cuir Velours was lovely enough, but I seemed to have forgotten it the next day. When I sprayed on some Bois d'Ascese, and wore it out of Scent Bar in LA, it faded a lot more quickly than I can tolerate in a smoke fragrance, and I sort of forgot the line altogether.\nUntil last month, when I was back in LA, frequenting Scent Bar a lot more than I have any business to. I'd long since decided that Bois was a tamer, less interesting sibling to Essence of John Galliano, the (now discontinued?) room spray by Diptyque. Galliano is my go-to woodsmoke scent. I spray it on clothes; typically, on a scarf, in the winter. It reminds me of homecoming bonfires in high school, where no matter where you stood the smoke made a bee line for you. Galliano is a holy grail for me and it hasn't been improved upon yet. I have something like six ounces and doubt I'll run out any time soon. I see no reason to cheat on it.\nSomehow, now that Bois had receded from view, I was able to smell Cuir Velours more clearly, and after several trips to Scent Bar I was hooked. I kept going back to it, re evaluating. It was my final purchase, and once again I'm struck by how a good perfume can take a while to permeate your attention. It's as if you have to catch up with it, or get it somewhere on its own, before you can truly appreciate it. This is one of the reasons I don't write so much about new releases. Almost every fragrance seems route to me upon first sniff. It takes a long time, living with one, to see it on its own terms, a long time to recognize its distinct appeal.\nPart of my problem with Cuir Velours at first (it seems like such a non problem now) was the fact that it didn't really smell like a leather to me at all, neither soft nor hard. I couldn't really see the connection.  These are all good signs in a fragrance for me - that initial disappointment, followed by a shift of perception and a percussive revelation. Cuir Velours is a different kind of leather, and I think I must have mistaken it for all those wan suede things that have pepper sprayed the market over the last several years, scents which seem to be apologizing for leather's offenses even while capitalizing on its mystique.\nVelours bears some relation to Daim Blond, the Serge Lutens suede that, for a change, gets it right, adding a startling peachy note to shake up a tired format. Cuir Velours sits somewhere between leather and suede, and while it feels more refined than your average leather (usually a turn off for me), it's saved, or maybe energized, by the judicious use of immortelle. Though I know it's a take no prisoners note within a composition, I've always felt that you can never be too liberal with immortelle. Too much has never been quite enough for me, which makes my appreciation of its subtle application in Cuir Velours at the very least...confusing. Like Daim Blond's radiant peach note, immortelle adds something beyond articulation and infinitely appealing to Cuir Velours basic structure.\nCuir Velours (aside from immortelle, notes listed are rum, labdanum, and incense) has a reputation already for being a variant of Skin Scent. I don't get that. On me, it radiates off the skin for hours, quietly but persistently. It smells, now, of leather, but its own peculiar version of leather. Like most good fragrances, Cuir Velours caused a recalibration in my thinking about what a leather is or can be. It's rich and, truly, velvety, with just the right touch of boozy - clean but compelling.\nMy experience with it makes me wonder how often this happens with other people - the vague interest which turns to strong, committed affection.\nVague, suspicious interest or even vague, disappointed dislike have turned to unbridled love for me several times. When it happens, it tends to make me rabidly loyal to and defensive about that fragrance, like no one understands its GENIUS but me. I remember that happened to me with L de Lolita Lempicka, which I smelled a couple of times and didn't get; it didn't strike me one way or the other. \nOther perfumes that took me a little while to grasp: Agent Provocateur, Moschino Couture, Joy, Champagne de Bois, even my all-time love Cuir de Lancome.\nElisa, I think L de Lolita is amazing as well. It is the signature fragrance of someone I work with and she smells of incense and vanilla, not the cupcake kind, real vanilla. I think sometimes it takes our brain a while to catch up with our nose. Chanel 5 was like this for me. When I finally capitulated to its abstract beauty, I could not understand why it took me so long to love it!\nOh, when I think of the perfumes I have swapped away, including \"L\"!\nAnd yet--I have come to realize that my nose doesn't care to be as adventurous as so many other folks'. I don't feel the need to smell like burnt rubber, someone's old leather jacket or dusty books. So I guess I continue to savor my vintage collection. There are not many new perfumes, even the much-discussed artisan & niche ones that interest me.\nNice to read something new from you, Brian. Hope you are well.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Is there scent-lover who doesn\u2019t instantly recognise Diptyque candles flickering in a room, filling the air with their beautiful perfumes\u2026? Fewer, though, are so familiar with the story behind this beautiful French fragrance and candle house, which actually began life at 35 Boulevard Saint Germain as a beautiful \u2018bazaar\u2019-like showcase for fabrics.\nDiptyque was created by trio of talented individuals: interior designer Christiane Gautrot, painter Desmond Knox-Leet (who\u2019d worked at Bletchley Park during World War II before settling in France), and set designer/theatre administrator Yves Coueslant. They teamed up in 1961, opening their Diptyque store (at the bohemian end of the Boulevard Saint-Germain) to offer the fabrics they\u2019d designed together. Desmond and Christiane had previously been creating fabrics and wallpapers for Sanderson and Heal\u2019s, and shared a similar aesthetic.\nThen, as now, the Diptyque creations were inspired by travels \u2013 to the Mediterranean, the near East, and the plants and flowers that flourish there, inviting you on a journey simply by lighting a wick, or spritzing a cooling Cologne. Resins, spices, wood notes, spring flowers \u2013 even the whispers from a bonfire \u2013 have all been captured by Diptyque, through scent.\nOver time, Diptyque has worked with some of the most creative \u2018noses\u2019 on the planet, including Olivia Giacobetti, Olivier P\u00e9scheux and Fabrice Pellegrin, who\u2019ve produced exquisite eaux de parfum, roll-ons (so useful for travelling) and an unusual \u2018vinaigre de toilette\u2018. There are so many ways to enjoy Diptyque on the body, as well as in the home, with the eaux de toilette and eaux de parfum offering something for every scent-lover.\nThe so-popular, poetically-named L\u2019Ombre dans L\u2019Eau was created to be reminiscent of a walk in an English garden, filled with the scent of Bulgarian rose petals and the tart tang of blackcurrant bush leaf, sap rising in the background to keep everything fresh. Tam Dao is infused with the sandalwood of Goa, paying tribute to that tree with its creamy woodiness.\nAnd in 2011, to celebrate 50 years of creativity, Diptyque took a leaf out of Patrick Suskind\u2019s extraordinary novel, \u2018Perfume\u2019, and set out to encapsulate the scents of its flagship boutique by bottling them.\n34 boulevard saint germain was born so that everyone could enjoy a little piece of this Parisian location, its history (and its soul): elements of sprayed perfumes, burnt flames, soaps lined up in drawers, wall-hangings, the polished wood counter \u2013 creating together a complex and captivating scent which has become one of Diptyque\u2018s bestsellers. You\u2019ll find notes of blackcurrants and green leaves (\u2018borrowed\u2019 from the fragrances Philosykos and Ombre dans L\u2019Eau), the citrus fruits and spices of the original L\u2019Eau, Egyptian geraniums and tuberose from Do Son \u2013 and a base of the woody notes, resins and balms which are so intrinsic a part of Diptyque\u2018s signature.\nWe think you\u2019ll also want to check out Diptyque Les Eaux: Eau de Lavande, Geranium Odorata, L\u2019Eau de N\u00e9roli and L\u2019Eau de Tarocco, among others (this last creation blending Mediterranean oranges with vibrant spices, in a beautifully fruity eau de Cologne). Read more in-depth about the fragrances, below.\nBut what we will say is that there is really no better way to explore the aromatic universe than to walk into one of Diptyque\u2018s many stores (or counters) around the world, and while away some happy time spritzing, spraying and trying on your skin.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "It's Enabler Pin Friday! Our community project for today: bestow a pin on someone who convinced you that you just had to try (or buy) a fragrance. And of course, wear the fragrance!\nPumpkins yesterday, carrots today \u2014 I am awarding an enabler pin to Karin, who way back in 2011 alerted me to the fact that there was a fantastic markdown on Honor\u00e9 des Pr\u00e9s I Love Les Carottes at SpaceNK. My favorite kind of enabling is that which gets you a bottle of great perfume for less than $25.\nNote: top image is Carrot Dice [cropped] by Steven Jackson at flickr; some rights reserved.\nHappy Enabler Pin Day! I bestow my pin on AnnE. In May she sent me some items in the freebie meet, and generously tossed in a few samples including one of Moss Gown.\nAnyway there was something about that Moss Gown that really sent me right back down the rabbit hole. It smelled totally new and reawakened that part of me that is always saying, \u201cThere might be some amazing smell you haven\u2019t discovered yet!\u201d Lucky coincidence that it happened right as I was graduating, because since then I have been having the most wonderful time attending estate sales, chasing down decants, and I even participated in my first swapmeet. A bonus side effect of all this is that my new job is really stressful, and this hobby provides a daily beauty that is a huge help and always gives me something to look forward to at the end of the day. I really do think my renewed interest is in large part due to that one sample of Moss Gown, so thank you, AnnE!\nThis calls for a special, Cartier manufactured enabler pin!\nIt was just one of those things, right? I found my HG in an assortment of extra samples sent in a swap, too. This was when I was first falling down the rabbit hole and had never heard of Vol de Nuit. You never know.\nOne of the community projects about \u201cslow burn\u201d inspired me to try Shalimar perfume. I\u2019ve always loved one of the flankers, but never really gave the real thing a shot.\nThat was a great enabling thread!\nJour de F\u00eate, and the pin goes to Ari. Totally agree with her review: oh so pretty, but the lack of projection and staying power is somewhat dismaying.\nThey need to do an intense version.\nOh! I am so thrilled to have made this world smell a little more strongly of Jour de Fete!\nI\u2019m awarding an enabler pin to Abigail, who used to blog regularly at I Smell Therefore I Am. She\u2019s still running The Posh Peasant decant service, but I wish she\u2019d post occasionally \u2013 I miss her writing.\nSOTD is Mariella Burani, which she talked me into very handily. I found a big bottle, barely used, on ebay, for $21, and have enjoyed it enormously.\nIt\u2019s me, Abigail! And I am blushing at your kind words. Thank you so much. I feel honored.\nMariella Burani is still among my top favorites and I have at least 2 back-up bottles. I only wish MB was still easily found for cheap, because these days it\u2019s mostly on ebay for very high prices now that people know it\u2019s it\u2019s rare stuff.\nI forgot about today\u2019s enabler pin. I\u2019d definitely have to give it to Brian, my fellow blogger at ISTIA, (we both hardly (or never) write anymore for various life reasons). The list of fragrances Brian encouraged me to try was endless.  And he also was the person, who discovered one of my top 5 faves, while traveling in Italy, and encouraged me to try: Profumi del Forte Roma Imperiale, which I could probably wear almost every day for the rest of my life and be happy.\nSOTD: Diptyque IE Mimosa. I got a 30 ml split and it\u2019s nearly gone. It goes fast since I need to apply at least 10 sprays, but it\u2019s a pretty and delicate mimosa.\nIt\u2019s such fun to discover a blogger with whom you share preferences \u2013 you and Donna at PST are the ones I overlap with most frequently, I think. So thanks for the Mariella Burani, and enjoy that well-deserved enabler pin.\nMy enabler pin goes to NST\u2019s own Angela, whose review of Diorella sent me straight off to the interwebs in search of the vintage formulation. Two sprays this morning \u2013 one distributed among wrists and neck, and a tiny one to the upper abdomen \u2013 and I\u2019m in a divine cloud of leather chypre. My tiny decant is of the EDC strength, in case anyone is wondering. And like lizbee, I can\u2019t even count the others here who have inspired me to try things I would never have discovered otherwise, so thank you all!\nHurray! I get a pin! I wonder if you mean Diorling, though.\nGood grief \u2013 I DID mean Diorling! And I\u2019m wearing it today which (at least theoretically) means I looked at a label and STILL managed to type it wrong. I blame morning! Thank you for the correction, AND for steering me to Diorling \u2013 it\u2019s a wonder!\nI have to give out 2 enabler pins. 1 to Musette from Perfumed Posse, whose writing makes me laugh and recently sent me samples, one was Lumiere Blanc, my SOTD. It\u2019s soft, cozy suede-like woody, slightly spicy and appropriate for casual Friday in the office, I would not say it is a very dressed up scent, but you could wear it to church. #2 goes to Mals86\u2026.I read your blog and comments, and have tried so many you have recommended\u2026Thanks.\nMusette is awesome, isn\u2019t she? I love her.\nAnd I\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve enjoyed some I did! Thanks.\nI bestow an enabler pin on mals, whose descriptions of Tabac Aurea, Mary Greenwell Plum, Le Temps d\u2019une Fete, Champagne de Bois, and Parfum Sacre resulted in full bottle purchases. It\u2019s funny, because mals and I aren\u2019t even scent twins. I like Youth Dew, whereas mals \u2013 well, I\u2019ll let mals tell you what she thinks of it. But where our interests intersect, I follow her advice.\nHonorable mention to Robin, whose review of Assam of India inspired me to buy a bottle based on the bottle itself! Fortunately the juice is great, too.\nHa\u2026and just noticed she has another just above!\nThat would have been hilarious! I suggest we all adopt a new acronym: MMMDI.\nWell I really have SO many to pick from (as Eleebelle mentioned\u2013basically all my fragrances count!) but to mix it up, and because I\u2019m in the mood for a chypre, today\u2019s SOTD is an enabler pin for Merlin, who sold me on Soir de Lune with the description that it was \u201csophisticated, but with a laid back glamour \u2013 a billionaire on holiday.\u201d Maybe it should be an enabler diamond tennis bracelet to go with?!\nOops that was meant to be its own comment!! I\u2019ll try again below. Meanwhile, I\u2019m completely with you on this proposed initialism!!\nHA! Too real!\nPinning another on Mals for Citizen Queen!\nI\u2019m not wearing anything at the moment (somehow \u201ccommando\u201d brings to mind no panties, despite its expressiveness, tee hee). But I want to say that in this year or so of the journey, Victoria and Robin gave me the nourishment, Gaia gave a lot too and was very often the tie-breaker on unsniffed buys. More importantly, perhaps, MALS and Kafka were those who more often talked me out of some those buys!!\nRe: Serge \u2013 MMMNDI. Didn\u2019t work for too long, in truth, but still, delayed purchases are sometimes better.\nYep. I bought Assam for the bottle as well\u2026 I\u2019m not proud of that, but it is what is. A very fun bottle!\nI bought Mary Greenwell Plum unsniffed after noticing that mals was wearing it every other day, at least!

She generously sent me lots of extra samples from the freebie meet last year and Kalemat was in that batch. I\u2019ve used up the sample she gave me, but I am now on the hunt for that gorgeous fragrance. It\u2019s absolutely divine and a wonderful autumn/winter fragrance.\n:-).

The smell is so beautiful, clean fresh notes with ascents of floral intertwined. The mist is subtle yet stands out. Feels lovely upon application, skin feels soft & silky. Absolutely beautiful product and beautiful scent, would like to buy the whole range. This is great for the summer months as it\u2019s light enough to apply in warmer weather. Can be applied all over the body, neck, & wrists. Will definitely recommend this!\nI really do love do son as a scent, its a fabulous deep tuberose. I have too much perfume at the moment so really couldnt justify buying a bottle of do son. I decided to try the do son body mist and am really glad i did. I expected a light refreshing mist but this product is surprisingly very different to that. It's a mixture between a traditional mist and a body lotion in spray format. You do need to massage into the skin. the scent os fab and is good value for money considering the 200ml size.\nBeing a fan of do son perfume I could really appreciate this mist. It smells so amazing and stays with me for a long time. It is perfect summer fragrance, when it is so hot that I don\u2019t really want to use any perfume. I find this scent to remind me of some exotic island with its beautiful flowers and fruits never seen before. It helps to feel better during these hot days being not able to leave my city. It is like a small paradise. Anyway I love this product only for its scent. Because honestly I didn\u2019t notice any moisturizing qualities or something making my skin look better. It didn\u2019t cause any irritation either. And I find it isn\u2019t really sticky. I would say it is rather comfortable to use. And nevertheless (despite of some minor demerits) I won\u2019t stop adoring it I think.\nHaving used the perfume version of Diptyque Do Son for years and loving, I couldn\u2019t pass on the Body mist. It\u2019s a lighter and budget-friendly option perfect for spraying yourself after the shower in the evening. Scent-wise it\u2019s wonderful and I highly recommend.\nI think this is such an affordable way to west the scent. I have bought this to gift many times as well as myself. I feel less guilty for spraying due to the price point. Longevity is good for a body spray too. In my opinion this is a scent for all!!<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " and I wouldn't call it wildly original, in fact, over the past week, I've worn it next to at least six other perfumes that seemed to invite comparison. It doesn't smell exactly like any of them, so unless you're the sort of person who would only buy one rose scent (horrors! you must have at least a few?) it is very much worth trying.\nAmaze is available in Eau de Toilette ($125 for 90 ml) and Eau de Parfum ($165 for 90 ml). The lasting power of the Eau de Parfum (please note that The People of the Labyrinths call it a Parfum) is excellent. For buying information, see the listing for The People of the Labyrinths under Perfume Houses.\nWhy do you say that POTL does not qualify as a great perfume? Just curious.\nAnd I cannot, of course. But if I was trying to come up with, say, the 100 greatest achievements in the field of perfumery, POTL wouldn't come to mind, whereas if I was thinking of my own desert island top 10, it would most certainly make the list. The same goes for Diptyque Philosykos, for that matter. If you were to ask me which was a Great Perfume, Philosykos or Chanel no. 5, I'd of course say the Chanel, but if you were to offer me a choice of the two bottles, I'd grab the Diptyque and run.\nEau d'Italie Paestum Rose: they are very different; the PR is much more sheer, way less rose-focused.\nLe Labo Rose 31: the LL is much spicier and woodier, again, very different.\nAgent Provocateur: I tried these together mostly because they are both rose/saffron, but the styles are so different it was hardly worth the exercise.\nOf all of the above, it is closest to the Montale. The Amaze is much more wearable and \u201cpretty\u201d than the Montale, with much more rose\u2026I certainly wouldn't write it off if you didn't like the Montale.\nI suppose my point was not that Amaze smells just like something else, but that you can easily enough think of similar things worth at least trying next to it. I don't think that is so with Luctor et Emergo.\nWhy doesn't POTL do 50 ml bottles, LOL? I'd own one already. I do hate buying 100 ml.\nExactly Or even 30ml. Did you see the 30ml PdN bottles on Beautyhabit? So great!\nR, I must be the only one so far who is not feeling the love. I'll have to whip out my sample again, but on me, Amaze was too medicinal.\nBut, I love me some POTL body cream. Now that one, if they ever give body creams any sort of rating, IS a classic!\nNope, it has not received universal love, I don't think \u2014 I read several less than favorable comments on MUA. And can't deny the medicinal \u2014 anything with agarwood smells medicinal, I think, and in this case the henna perhaps increases the medicinal part. I just love that smell!\nI'm really not sure what to make of Amaze. It starts off on me with a kind of melted plastic note, which thankfully dissipates quickly, but then I'm left with a strange, herbal floral that seems to grow sour over the course of time. Which sounds as if I hate it, but I don't. I think it may just take some time to 'get'. I tested it along with Divine l'Inspiratrice and Tocca Touch, and it took me a couple of days to 'learn' which one was which \u2013 there were enough similarities to confuse me. It just doesn't feel as if it comes from the same stable as L&E, which is utterly unique \u2013 this one is fascinating, but not quite one-of-a-kind, as you say.\nYou know, agarwood sort of grows on you, I think \u2014 I used to think the first few minutes of 10 Corso Como were horrible, now I love it right from the start, and same is true of many other oudh scents. So \u201cmelted plastic\u201d might be accurate, I just don't \u201csmell it that way\u201d, if that makes any sense at all, in fact, I thought the oudh was subtle. Agree it has a definite herbal undertone.\nWhat did you think of the Divine? Haven't opened my sample yet.\nAll I have to say is: I agree with everything you wrote! POTL doesn't smell good on me at all, but I know whereof you speak (more of a mood, etc.) and I wish I got what you got.\nAmaze, yes \u2014 I thought of Paestum Rose and Ta'if, and while it's a dupe of neither, it's not breaking any new ground. POTL is a one-off; so far as I can tell from the people who love it, there is nothing else in that niche.\nBut I will. And this 'un too.\nWould love to know who the perfumers were for both of these, M \u2014 they did a good job on both. And maybe Amaze will find a wider audience? But it also doesn't fit in with the lab bottle packaging as well as LeE.\nWill be curious to hear what you think then\u2026certainly you'll be able to try Amaze with an open mind, more than I could.\nWell R, while I haven't had the opportunity to smell AMAZE yet, you made me get out my Luctor sample and revisit it as I remember not \u201cgetting it\u201d the first few times I tried it. Today though, I'm definitely getting a mood from it. It is interesting. Play Doh. Thats all I can seem to ever smell from this one and I think if I didn't read that it smelled like Play-Doh, I probably wouldn't have placed the scent (or maybe I would have, who knows) but ever since I read Play Doh thats ALL I can smell.\nWhen you said saffron plus rose, I immediately thought of Safran Troublant, in which the rose is a short-lived, but breathtakingly beautiful, element. How does Amaze compare to it? I hardly ever wear them, but I love honest-to-god rose scents.\nWell, I certainly like it, but I haven't decided yet if I need a bottle. I kinda wish it were MORE medicinal (since I am a big fan of both Montale Rose Petals and 10 CC, this is not a surprise).\nStill, you're not alone \u2014 for many people, it is just \u201cthat Play Doh perfume\u201d!\nThe balance is the opposite to me: ST is mostly saffron with some rose, this is mostly rose (and woods) with some saffron. ST is also both creamier & more transparent.\nI know what you mean \u2014 I wouldn't mind more oudh either. The rose note in this one is so much prettier (to my nose) than the rose in Montale though.\nAmazing how chemistry affects a scent. I ordered a sample of A-Maze through LuckyScent and as soon as I put it on I was overwhelmed and I had to wash it off immediately. It's a big, loud, sharp rose on me and if anyone wants my sample, email me.\nI'd love to try your sample, but there's no active link in order to email you!\nI'm head over heels about this one. Was SO relieved that it wasn't \u201clight\u201d as the description had suggested. My only question is whether or not I need the edt or edp. W/ the original there was a real difference to my nose between the edtp and edp (not just in lasting power). I've so far only smelled the edt of A Maze. Do you think there's a difference? Am trying to decide which to get.\nAgree, it isn't particulary light at all and no idea why they are using that term in the description.\nI have only smelled the EdP of Amaze so can't compare, but based on having smelled Luctor et Emergo in both forms, would personally recommend that you stick with the EdP. The EdT of LeE lacks the depth of the EdP, although I find both to have very good lasting power.\nMy email is |||EMAIL_ADDRESS||| Just shoot me an email with your mailing address and I'll pop this in the mail to you.\nAnd Zeram1, if you'll also post here that you've seen this message, I'll delete the above so Dawn's address isn't hanging out in cyberspace. Thanks!\nMy skin destryed each and every one of the interesting notes and all I got was this very mellow rose. Not bad at all, but nothing to dream about, either.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Christmas shopping in London is something else. Ever since I was little we would annually go to London for gift shopping. The family tradition brings back so many heart-warming memories that I attempt to uphold it as much as possible. Since I know London like the back of my hand, I can easily stuff all my favourite addresses, streets and shops into a 72 hours shopping itinerary and build in some sightseeing and high-tea-ing on the side. Because seriously, can one ever get enough of seeing the changing of the guards at Buckingham Palace? In London my motto is: Seen it, done it, but doing it again anyway just for fun. For the less well-traveled and London newbies I compiled an extended guide to Christmas shopping in London.\nThe iconic luxury department store Harrods always meets expectations when it comes to their Christmas shop windows and their \u2018Christmas World\u2019 department. It is therefore always my first stop when I visit London. Harrods has been around since 1849 when it started as a grocery store. Today it has seven floors and 330 departments. When the almost 12000 light bulbs turn on at night it becomes a magical landmark. The shop windows are a true spectacle that draw adults and children. This year (2017) they teamed up with Dolce & Gabanna to create a fashionable and entertaining window display and other decor throughout the store. Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana created 14 magnificent themes in the windows with dressed Sicilian puppets, glamorous mannequins and Italian designs. (Watch my video on my YouTube channel for moving pictures of the animated dolls) Don\u2019t miss the Egyptian Hall and stairs, the Salon de Parfums, the Foods departments and of course Christmas World.\nMy second favourite place to go gift shopping and experience the Christmas spirit is Covent Garden. The area is packed with small boutiques and restaurants. But you will also find larger brand stores here like Kate Spade, Rituals and Ladur\u00e9e. In the center of Covent Garden is the old market building which used to be a fruit and vegetables market in yester years. Now it houses lovely coffee and lunch spots and small boutiques.\nNot far from Covent Garden there are 2 hidden shopping areas. One is Seven Dials, seven clustered streets that all unite at the Cambridge Court roundabout. The Seven Dials streets are boasting with independent boutiques, lifestyle stores and cozy restaurants. The other shopping area is Neal\u2019s Yard, consisting of two streets that opens into a courtyard with colourful facades.\nCarnaby street in Soho is the street to score exclusive gadgets, fun gifts and other hip and trendy things. It\u2019s a magnet for the young adults. Carnaby street is just off Regent street and close to Piccadilly Circus. Also part of Carnaby is Kingly Court, a three-storey food and dining destination. Here you\u2019ll find 21 restaurants, caf\u00e9s, bars and food shops around a beautifully lit courtyard. Newburgh quarter with its cobbled streets draws people who love independent shops, one-off concepts and trendy pubs and bars. The quarter runs through Newburgh Street, Marshall Street, Ganton Street, Foubert\u2019s Place, Lowndes Court and Marlborough Court.\nFortnum & Mason is th\u00e9 quintessential British department store. Founded in 1707, it is a the grocer to the queen. This is your address for exclusive perfumes and beautifully boxed beauty gifts. On the ground floor you\u2019ll find the most extensive assortment of teas and tinned delicacies. Stately spiral stairs lead to the other departments and restaurants. The Fortnum & Mason hampers are iconic and did you know they invented the scotch egg? Before entering the store take a minute to look up at the the famous Fortnum\u2019s clock. The clock has bells from the same foundry as Big Ben. Every fifteen minutes a selection of airs is played on eighteen bells.\nAnother London landmark and shoppers\u2019 favourite is department store Liberty. On the corner of Regent street and Great Marlborough street there\u2019s the slightly prominent building that looks as if moved from Germany or Switzerland. Liberty can\u2019t escape anyone. The store has been around since 1875 when Arthur Liberty started it as an Eastern style bazar with fabrics, ornaments and art objects. Shopping at Liberty is an experience with its heritage still palpable.\nWhen you see photos of London during the Christmas season, it is your best bet that it\u2019s a photo of Regent street. Favourite stores in this street are Molton Brown, Anthropologie (must go!), Kate Spade, Gap, Uniqlo and Ted Baker. But this is also where you can shop Zara, H&M and Top Shop.\nLondon\u2019s high street is Oxford street. It has more than 300 shops and is 1.9 km. Here you\u2019ll find all the big brands like Nike, H&M, Zara, House of Fraser, Marks & Spencer and Debenhams. You can either start at the beginning (Marble Arch) end (Tottenham) or in the middle at Oxford Circus where it crosses with Regent street.\nOxford street is lined with department stores, but there\u2019s one that is legendary and that is Selfridges. In 1906 Harry Selfridge opened his store that soon became legendary with its unconventional shop windows, innovative and creative marketing events and cutting edge products. Selfridge was the founder of experience shopping. It has been named Best department store of the world three times. I have to be honest and say that Selfridges isn\u2019t as exclusive any more as it used to be. They also changed the set up of the store which I think wasn\u2019t for the better.\nMayfair is the neighbourhood of the upperclass Londoners. Bondstreet, formed of New and Old Bondstreet is where you\u2019ll find Victoria\u2019s Secret, all the high fashion design stores like Prada, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, but also more affordable shops like MAC, Tod\u2019s and La Perla.\nIn Brook street there are a few of my favourite stores namely: Penhaligon\u2019s the British perfume house (no 20), Diptyque the Parisian fragrances and scented candles icon (no 37) and Pretty Ballerinas with the largest and most beautiful assortment of flat ballet shoes (no 34).\nAlthough Nottinghill is much more beautiful in spring and summer when everything is in bloom, it is still picturesque in winter. The colourful houses and the vintage and antique shops draw hordes of tourist in all seasons. Portobello Road is therefore packed during the Christmas shopping season with people scouring for antique treasures. From metrostation Noting Hill gate, you can walk via Pembridge Road to Portobello Road. On this route you pass many avantgarde shops and retro boutiques. Other popular streets are Golborne Road and Clarendon Cross. I prefer to go to the less crowded Westbourne Grove and Ledbury road where young urban professionals and 30-something families go for shopping and coffee. It has an elegant, non-pretentious atmosphere with international allure.\nLambs Counduit street and its side streets in Bloomsbury is almost like a village in the big city. Small book shop, cozy coffee bars and independent shops make this another favourite shopping area for me personally. Don\u2019t be surprised if you get handed a glass of wine, hot chocolate or Christmas cookies when you enter a shop. It\u2019s what they do in Bloomsbury. A few years ago I published an extensive shopping route with all my favourite shops. You can re-read it here.\nSecond-hand finds, vintage and bric-brac. Camden Stables is mostly about browsing and scouring for that little gem. The ambiance at the old stables is like nowhere else. It is located in the historic stables of Pickfords and the Grade II horses hospital. Small boutiques and over 700 stalls fill the passages and old railway viaducts. It\u2019s so much fun to wander through the maze of streets and arches hidden behind wooden gates and high brick walls. Marvel at the huge bronze statues of horses that remind us of the heritage. Indulge in the many foods from ethnic vendours with foods like Chinese noodle dishes or Indian flat breads with spicy meat. Best time to visit is at night when the massive chandeliers are lit and cast a magical ambiance in the brick corridors.\nShoreditch is hip, eclectic, artistic and hipster. To explore this part you will need a full day. Best day to go to Shoreditch is Sunday when there are lots of markets and the ambiance is at its best. The most popular streets are Old Street, Great Eastern Street and Shoreditch High Street, Red Church street, Old Spitalfields Market, Brick Lane and Columbia Road Market. Shoreditch is a melting pot of cultures and lifestyles. From ethnic shops, handmade design shops and quaint coffee shops to bustling restaurants and vintage markets. Shoreditch has it all. Read my 2 Shoreditch shopping routes here and here.\nChelsea where you\u2019ll find the Conran shop, Jonathan Adler, and Kings Road with trendy boutiques and shops like Gap, Cath Kidston and Anthropologie.\nMake daily plans and itineraries to save time.\nLondon is huge and commutes always take longer than you expected. Nothing is more annoying than finding out that you were already near a street or site before and have to go back to that part of town.<|endoftext|>"

Made from alcohol-free wax, this scented balm is housed in an attractively decorated case. With refills available, the Diptyque Solid Perfume 34B is both eco-responsible and portable for on-the-go fragrance application.\nTRITICUM VULGARE (WHEAT) STARCH - ISONONYL ISONONANOATE - PARFUM (FRAGRANCE) - PARAFFIN - SILICA - SYNTHETIC WAX - HYDROGENATED MICROCRYSTALLINE WAX - MICROCRYSTALLINE WAX - LINALOOL - COUMARIN - LIMONENE - HYDROXYCITRONELLAL - GERANIOL - EUGENOL - CITRONELLOL - ALPHA-ISOMETHYL IONONE - BENZYL BENZOATE - CINNAMAL - BHT - BENZOIC ACID - BENZYL CINNAMATE - CITRAL - METHYL BENZOATE - ISOEUGENOL - BENZYL SALICYLATE - FARNESOL - BENZYL ALCOHOL - TOCOPHEROL.\nRated 4 out of 5 by Emma S from cute and portable This is one of my favourite Diptyque scents. The case is small but weighty and substantial. Although I appreciate the 34 is classic in its solid black case, it does make it harder to find in your bag than the other, more colourful designs. I really like that these new solid perfumes from Diptyque are refillable. You can buy one nice little case and then extra refills and swap them over from time to time.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Annett from Travel friendly I think this is a great option for travellers. Very tiny can, which barely can be found in a lady\u2019s bag :) Scent lasts less if compared to regular liquid form, but still long enough and I don\u2019t regret that I purchased it. Refillable package is another great pro of this perfume.\nRated 5 out of 5 by NurseJaniceEmmanuel from Luxurious compact & beautiful fragrance I thought I\u2019d treat myself to this little gem and I\u2019m glad I did. The compact is heavy and luxurious, but small enough to fit into an evening bag. The fragrance is beautiful and lasts all day without being overpowering. I would say it is definitely an evening scent. It was a good price and the refills aren\u2019t badly priced, either. I will be buying the refills and I will buy myself another compact in the range with a different fragrance, maybe Do Son.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "To say I'm a bit obsessed with orange blossom at the moment would be a mild understatement, so you might want to bear that in mind as you read this - basically, if it promises to smell of orange blossom, I'm bound to at least like it a lot. And if it delivers, as Diptyque's Eau de Sens does (in spades), then it's a full-blown affair of the heart.\nRight, on with the review \"proper\"* (allegedly). Diptyque Eau de Sens is not quite a soliflore orange blossom, as the orange blossom here is backed up with notes of juniper berries (and some of you will know I'm a gin drinker, right?), patchouli and angelica. According to the press release, it promises to deliver the full smell of an orange tree in blossom, right down to the roots.\nThere's a gloriously diaphanous waft of spicy orange on first spray, the juniper berries giving just a little not-quite-soapy zing to the citrussy concoction, before it settles to a woody-green aspect of orange blossom. This middle section is hugely reminiscent of petitgrain smelling, as it does, of both flowers and stems, with just a hint of something woodier beneath. The dry-down is a light and rather clean patchouli - there's no dirt in this fragrance at all - and it's all perfectly simple and incredibly linear. Eau de Sens is both uncomplicated and unsweet, but rather beautiful all the same.\nThe notes actually make it sound like it'll be a rather dark and hard to wear fragrance, but Eau de Sens is actually surprisingly light and sheer (you'll want multiple sprays, and regular ones, at that), and rather playful in wear. It's an easy-going scent, perfectly attuned to wearing with jeans and a crisp white shirt, though I've worn it to all sorts of occasions since my bottle turned up, including to parliament, as it's so perfectly at home everywhere. I've worn it so much that my bottle is now nearly empty - I can't remember the last time I emptied a perfume bottle so quickly! A shame really, as this bottle has been engraved!\n* To be honest, I've written so little this year, I've kind of lost the ability to think about anything in any kind of \"proper\" critical fashion, really. Sorry. Not sorry. Turns out I like not blogging almost as much as I like blogging. WOE!<|endoftext|>"

It\u2019s the perfect finishing touch to a room that is also about simplicity and ageless style.\nIn Japan, gardening is seen as a form of high art, and artisan perfumers have infused this candle some of the finest scents of such a garden. Black pepper and coriander announce the aromatic spices drifting along on a cool breeze. A rich heart of sandalwood gives way to base notes of bourbon, vanilla and sesame.\nThe stylish black glass holder is perfectly suited to a classical Japanese, modernist or minimalist aesthetic. Trim the cotton wick before burning for best effect.\nI love a number of Byredo scents and so I was really keen to try this candle. The black wax and jar are stunning and it burns evenly and cleanly. The scent is very unusual - a smoky oriental. Initially, I thought the scent was barely noticeable but on the second burn, it really kicked in. Maybe even a little too smoky and strong for my liking. It is definitely an acquired taste. I will burn this again on a cold evening which is more suited to enjoy this fireside scent. I think it will grow on me.\nBought this about a month ago to add to my growing collection of scents from this fabulous brand - I'm obsessed! As with the other scents from this brand, the fragrance is gorgeous and the throw is perfect for my open plan kitchen/living area Burnt daily for a couple of hours, this candle lasted me approx 2 weeks which I think is reasonable so will continue to repurchase Will absolutely repurchase!\nHaving tried a few ByRedo candles, I purchased this when I wasn't able to get hold of my favourite Diptyque one. These candles are beautifully packaged and come in a stylish glass pot; it's just unfortunate that the opaque dark glass means the candle doesn't flow through it. I've found these candles need to burn for a while before giving off their scent, but once they do, it lasts. This one reminds me of bubbling caramel and I think would be a great fragrance for<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "It\u2019s a chilly winter Sunday in Paris, but that wouldn\u2019t stop me from spending a fantastic day out and about in the City of Light.\nNext up is a quick trip by the Metro to the Rue Montorgueil for brunch at the wonderful Stuart Friendly, a small LGBT bistro and bar that dubs itself \u201chetero friendly.\u201d It\u2019s practically an institution among gay men in the city. Although a bit pricey (around $25), you get smoked salmon, made-to-order eggs, croissants, other baked treats (like pain au chocolat), salad, coffee, orange juice, and yogurt. Sunday brunches are the rare exception to the Parisian breakfast rule of just croissants (or buttered baguette) and coffee.\nSince most of the food shops on the Rue Montorgueil and the culinary supply stores nearby are closed on Sunday, I decide to meander through the Les Halles district and cross over into the Marais \u2014 one of the few neighborhoods where most businesses are open on Sundays. (The rest of Paris is almost entirely closed down for the day, many also on Mondays).\nAlthough I love the area around the Rue Sainte-Croix de la Bretonnerie, which is pretty much the heart of LGBT Paris, today I\u2019m going to do a bit of window shopping (what the French call Faire du leche-vitrines, which creepily translates to \u201cwindow licking\u201d) on the elegant Rue de Francs-Bourgeois, a six-block stretch from Rue des Archives to the Place de Vosgues that is home to dozens of tiny shops and boutiques. Some of my favorites: Spontini (men\u2019s clothing), Oliviers & Co. (olive oils and vinegars), Fragonard (men\u2019s and women\u2019s perfumes and cologne), Muji (a Japanese clothing and housewares shop), Home Autour du Monde (fun home decorations), and Diptyque (akin to a Bath and Bodyworks).\nAfter grabbing a snack and a can of soda from a souvenir shop near the Place des Vosges, I wander into the square itself, snag a park bench and enjoy watching the Parisians (and a few tourists) enjoying the green space (even in winter) with picnics, just lounging about on the lawn or playing with their children. The symmetrical square, built by King Henri IV from 1605 to 1612, was the first planned square in France and the residences surrounding it briefly served as home to French royalty, members of the royal court and other wealthy nobles.\nWith evening setting in, I decide to make one last stop before I return home \u2014 a visit to the Maison de Victor Hugo that\u2019s on the southern edge of the Place des Vosges. This small museum marks the home where the celebrated French author lived from 1832 to 1848. It was here that Hugo penned Les Miserables. Many of the objects on display in the museum are the originals used by Hugo, including his writing desk and pens, and the views from his second-floor apartment of the square outside are delightful.\nWith the last of the day\u2019s sunlight fading away, it\u2019s time to head home for a quiet evening at my rented apartment, a quick dinner and perhaps some reading or a DVD before hitting the sack to rest up for another busy day in the glorious City of Light.\nThis entry was posted in Beauty of Paris, Breakfast, Cafes and Bistros, Churches, Food, LGBT Paris, Literature, Marais, Parks and Squares, Shopping, Sunday in Paris, Writers and tagged Diptyque, Fragonard, Home Autour du Monde, LGBT restaurants, Maison de Victor Hugo, Marais, Muji, Oliviers and Co., Place des Vosges, Rue Montogueil, Saint Sulpice, Spontini, Stuart Friendly, Sunday in Paris, Victor Hugo by Bob Adams.

        "passage": "Oh, so you thought Rose Week was over, huh? Here\u2019s a bonus round for Rose Week 2018! I\u2019ve put together a guide of rose scented candles. Of course there are more roses than this but there really should be something in this guide for anyone that is looking to add a rose candle (or in my case, candles) to their home fragrance wardrobe.\nYankee Candle Fresh Cut Roses \u2013 I\u2019m not a fan of Yankee Candle (why? I\u2019m a snob and I can\u2019t get past their dated packaging \u2013 I\u2019m horrible, I know), but I couldn\u2019t omit this fragrance from the list. It\u2019s that classic, old school cottage rose. It sort of smells like rose air freshener, but that\u2019s exactly why I like it. Retails for $28 at Yankee Candle. Other sizes are available.\nVotivo Rush of Rose \u2013 Here\u2019s another one of those classic roses. It\u2019s a dewy cottage rose. It\u2019s one of my favorite straight-up rose-rose home fragrances. My review. Retails for $28 at Votivo. Other sizes are also available.\nVoluspa Prosecco Rose \u2013 This what the name implies! It\u2019s a bubbly, effervescent fruity-rose that reminds me of perfumes like YSL Paris. The vessel is metallic pink that is sort of shabby chic. Retails for $30 at Nordstrom. Other sizes are available.\nThymes Kimono Rose \u2013 This is a delicate, sweet rose. It\u2019s like rosewater, peonies and vanilla. If I had to describe it one word, I\u2019d say \u201cpink\u201d. Retails for $30 at Thymes.\nAntica Farmacista Damascena Rose, Orris & Oud \u2013 This is like a powdery but jammy rose/iris floral with an amber base. Retails for $44 at Nordstrom.\nSkandinavisk Lempi \u2013 I literally just sniffed this in store yesterday. The brand is new to me. But, I can easily deduce that it\u2019s a brand inspired by Scandinavia. This one is a playful fruity-floral. It\u2019s pink roses and juicy strawberries. Retails for $48 at Nordstrom.\nMolton Brown Rosa \u2013 We\u2019ll switch gears from the proper English rose and fruity-florals to something different with this Molton Brown. This one vaguely reminds me of Malle Portrait of a Lady. It\u2019s a patchouli and jammy rose. Retails for $49 at Saks.\nLola James Harper The Music Studio on Trufo Street \u2013 This is a line of candles that make me feel tragically unhip but I do like them. This scent is like a gauze-like, diffused rose (paired with modern woods). It\u2019s a nice mix of modern and antique. Retails for $50 at Luckyscent.\nHonorable mentions: Urban Outfitters has a house brand done through Tru Fragrances that is actually pretty solid as a line, Gourmand. There\u2019s a candle, Macaron Rose, which smells just like the name implies and retails for $14.\nDiptyque Roses \u2013 Diptyque has a few rose scented home fragrances. Some are limited edition, others are in their permanent line. Roses is a velvety, red rose. It\u2019s a classic. Retails for $64 at Nordstrom. Other sizes are available for Diptyque candles.\nDiptyque Baies \u2013 Baies is like a blackcurrant rose. It\u2019s a green, fruity rose reminiscent of their perfume, L\u2019Ombre dans L\u2019Eau. Retails for $64 at Nordstrom.\nJo Malone London Red Roses \u2013 I actually prefer the Jo Malone London home fragrances and bath/body products over the perfumes. They\u2019re great quality. This is another one of those \u201cbouquet of a dozen red roses\u201d scents. It\u2019s crisp, floral and not too powdery. Retails for $65 at Nordstrom. Other sizes are available for Jo Malone London.\nRoads Black Door \u2013 I had to have something on here for those that don\u2019t love roses as much as I do. This is more like sweet tobacco and amber with a scattering of velvety rose petals. Retails for $65 at Barneys.\nCoqui Coqui Rosas Frescas \u2013 This is one of the few Coqui Coqui scents that I like. It smells just like the name implies \u2013 a fresh rose. It\u2019s like a red rose bouquet. Retails for $75 at Beautyhabit.\nEx Nihilo Ultra Rose \u2013 Currently this is my rose candle obsession. It\u2019s such a perfect rose soliflore. Realistic and traditional without smelling clich\u00e9. Crisp, rosy and glamorous. Retails for $75 at Saks.\nBelle Fleur Velvet Santal \u2013 Belle Fleur has an entire collection of candles inspired by oriental-style roses. I really like Velvet Santal because it\u2019s a plummy rose with sandalwood incense. Retails for $79 at Belle Fleur.\nByredo Loose Lips \u2013 This is one of those cosmetic roses. It\u2019s a rose/violet that brings to mind ruby red lipstick and French face powder. Retails for $80 at Luckyscent. Other sizes are avialable for Byredo.\nByredo Burning Rose \u2013 Look, another from Byredo! This is what the name implies. It\u2019s a smoldering rose with a hint of leather. Retails for $80 at Luckyscent.\nJo Malone London Velvet Rose and Oud \u2013 Here\u2019s another Jo Malone London scent except this one is in their \u201cluxe\u201d line. This is a gorgeous jammy rose meets an incense-like oud and amber. Retails for $85 at Nordstrom.\nTom Ford Caf\u00e9 Rose \u2013 Coffee and stuff is listed but I don\u2019t really pick up on it. To me, it\u2019s more of an earthy rose that\u2019s still undeniably rose. My review. Retails for $98 at Nordstrom.\nOrmonde Jayne Ta\u2019if \u2013 This is an oriental fragrance. It\u2019s a jammy rose with amber and spicy saffron. It makes for a lovely home fragrance. My review. Retails for $85 at<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " end of each post!! For my introduction to holiday shopping, I've compiled a list of my favorite under-the-radar websites for those who are tired of the Sephora, Amazon, and Barney's routine. I find that bargain-friendly internet shopping is my antidote to holiday stress; so peruse the links at your leisure and check back tomorrow for more great holiday gift ideas!\n1.) http://www.beadstore.com: For gorgeous and incredibly well-priced 15 inch strands of rare beads such as Labradorite and Blood Stone, or more recognizable cobalt blue Lapis Lazuli (pictured) and blush pink Cherry Quartz, check out this fabulous website recommended by Lucky Magazine. You can also purchase striking necklaces from Indonesia, Africa, India, and the Middle East that would cost a fortune at Barney's and many of which are priced under $200.\n2.) http://www.fredflare.com: This is the perfect website if you want to find an interesting little something for a child, adult, or teenager. From quirky and artistic gifts like an Olivetti Manual Typewriter or Toast Band-Aids, to hard-to-find items like TokyoMilk Lip Balm in Petits Fours (pictured) and Fashion Origami, you'll be sure to find something for everyone on your list. Notably, most of the items are well below $50. Make your life easier by shopping their holiday gift guide (which narrows down your selection based on price range) for a quick one-stop shop.\n3.) http://www.beautyhabit.com: For those high-end beauty addicts out there that require a hard to find perfume, skincare product, or makeup fix, this site is the prescription. While they carry a slew of well known luxe brands like L'Artisan Perfumes, Molton Brown bath products, and Diptyque candles, it's the lesser known items (many of which are European imports) like Serge Lutens hypnotic scents, Maison Belles' Organic and wonderful-smelling cleaning products, and Diane Brill's Mermaid's Pearl Blush (part of her Face Lingerie line), that are the real treasures on this site. Click on the \"What's New\" section for all the latest beauty finds, and check out the fabulous gift guide that lets you customize your search by price point. Best of all, orders come with a little packet of luxury samples, so that you can have a little gift for yourself too.\n4.) http://www.taschen.com: With titles ranging from The Big Book of Breasts to Balthus, Taschen has all the crazy, edgy, cool pop culture and art publications that will satisfy the in-the-know type on your list. Check out the hefty Circus tome (pictured) that popped up on the Vogue holiday gift list for $200, or for a more affordable option, choose one of the slim soft cover art books focusing on a variety of art movements or specific artists (such as Arcimboldo, De Lempicka, and Mucha) all under $10.\n5.) http://www.johnderian.com: Elegant platters, dishes, and paper weights are de rigeur at this Victorian-inspired decoupage wonderland that features something tasteful for everyone. Fanciful indulgences such as beauty trays decorated with vintage images of colorful talcum powders, dessert platters ornamented with delicate French pastries, and heart-shaped dishes featuring blooming pink hydrangea (pictured) are perfect choices for those hard-to-shop-fors on your list. There are also masculine items like heavy rectangular nautical-themed paper weights and letter trays featuring images of vintage stamps. There are many items to choose from that are priced under $100.\nInsider Tip: Museum shops' websites are a great place to find unusual gift ideas, and often members get great discounts during the holiday season!\nIt is so cold outside, that I don't even feeling like eating the peppermint-stick ice cream in my fridge tonight. Whenever I was forced to venture outside today I bundled up with ear muffs, a down coat, leather gloves, and wool socks. Unfortunately, it doesn't look as though the weekend will be any warmer. But you can fight against the effects of winter with the tried and true remedies listed below, and of course be sure to bundle up!!\n1.) Maribelle hot chocolate is the perfect wickedly rich winter drink to cuddle up with. Tip: Spike it with Amaretto and you'll be feeling the warm glow of the holidays in no time.\n2.) Originally created for outdoor enthusiasts like ice fisherman, tiny hand warmers are ideal for keeping your hands and feet toasty while you go about your winter shopping or wait for a bus.\n3.) Don't be fooled by it's drugstore-ish packaging, Yu-Be Cream, which is used by Japanese mountain climbers, is serious stuff. Hands down, it is the best remedy for combating winter dryness. Apply it to dry lips, cuticles, knuckles, and elbows for maximum comfort.\n4.) Now these may not be the prettiest nightwear ever, and yes wearing these might make you feel like a child in a Norman Rockwell painting, but trust me, flannel footed pajamas are the way to go! Seriously, they even come with a trap-door flap! How authentic is that!!\nYou might be asking yourself, \"Does such a thing actually exist?\" I was also skeptical that down coats could actually be tailored-looking and pretty. I found a black down coat with a mink collar, the closest that I had ever come to finding a stylish down coat, 5 years ago on sale at Searle and have been wearing it every winter ever since. It's black, so it doesn't show much wear, and more importantly it keeps me incredibly warm without looking like I'm walking around in a sleeping bag. Thankfully, this season designers seem to have taken an interest in making over the traditional down coat into a truly wearable and tailored winter must-have.\nLast night's episode of Gossip Girl was great, and I don't know if I can wait a whole two weeks for a new one. Anyway, besides the utter amazingness of hot gallery guy's newfound love of monogamy, Vanessa's sneakiness, Serena's ever-dwindling skirt length, and Blair's perpetual bitchiness, this past episode made me really miss the lady-like Jenny Humphrey of season's past. Specifically, the Eloise-ish, genteel, pastel-wearing, Blair's nemesis Jenny, who hangs out on the steps of the Met. Recently she's been donning the kohl-rimmed eyeliner look, sporting plaid duds with fingerless gloves, carrying emancipation papers as her accessory, and her blonde hair looks like Sally Hershberger chopped it off in the dark. Will the former Jenny ever return to us? She did wipe her eyeliner off when she returned home to the Brooklyn loft and looked a bit more like the Jenny we all know and love, so possibly there is still hope that she'll come back from the dark side (stylistically speaking). In the meantime however, indulge your Jenny Humphrey nostalgia with this pink designer beret from Barney's that was a Jenny fave in the past and is perfect for late fall strolls in Central Park. Also, this elegant blush pink puffer coat from Uniqlo which retails for under $100 is perfect for the fashionista on a budget. Think of them as mementos (if you will) of the former school girl turned edgy fashion designer.\nIn an attempt to streamline my daily routine, I recently purchased this Wildflower Makeup Palette by Josie Maran. I read in Vogue or Elle that Maran's line of planet-friendly beauty products are perfect for creating a fresh-faced no-makeup look, and this palette definitely did not disappoint. All the eye shadows and blushes leave a subtle wash of color and are easily build-able for night-time-glam looks. It also takes much less time to apply makeup with this palette, because you don't have to waste time fishing around in your cosmetic's bag for each separate product. When my mother asked me to do her makeup for a Greek wedding that she was attending, I whipped out my Josie Maran palette and did a complete day-to-evening look in under 10 minutes. She was thrilled with the beautiful results! She noshed on grape leaves and danced the night away with abandon (My-Big-Fat-Greek-Wedding-style), while her makeup remained firmly in place with nary a smudge or any creasing in sight! The palette is completely versatile, is perfect for all skin types (even sensitive or blemish-prone), works well for different complexions (my mother is olive while I am very fair), and is wonderful for all ages.\nThough the nights of lacing up your hot pink roller skates at the Roxy may be behind you, channel the days of roller disco divas with these colorful accessories from day-lab. These vintage headbands (in a rainbow of aqua, red, yellow, and lilac styles) are hippy-ishly fun and will inject your outfit with a dose of insta-chic. Pair one with this shrinky-dink-ish Roller-Skate City pendant that looks like a pen and ink illustration straight out of Where The Sidewalk Ends. The miniature wheels even move! These accessories are so<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Thinking outside the bottle\u2014no spills, no leaks\u2014and ready to go anytime, anywhere: Metapack worked with the Diptyque brand to create the first scented ribbon dispenser made by a perfume brand.\nHCT Group has launched an entire packaging program (HCT EMA, Eco Modern Approach) dedicated to sustainable packaging innovations, including a line of mono-material components made from 100% PET.\nMilk Makeup\u2019s lineup of solid makeup and skincare items appeared as new formats in their product categories.\nRoberts Beauty\u2019s DropStick Contour features an out-of-the-ordinary profile.\nGolden Arrow specializes in using molded fibers for primary and secondary packaging\u2014and says sustainability has been woven into their innovation process.\nMetapack has created a range of stock models made of zamac that are refillable, such as pursers, compacts, perfume stick containers and lipstick containers.\nHoliday compacts from MG New York elevate deco with 4-color printing on holographic foil, heavy multilevel embossing and 3D raised printing in white for the Bobbi Brown logo.\nAnisa International\u2019s Liquid Drops brush collection has recessed silicone reservoirs that allow the consumer to custom blend their beauty routine right in their product applicator.\nThe jar for Kiehl\u2019s Pure Vitality Skin Renewing Cream is topped with an innovative dispensing material that enables the consumer to \u201cpush\u201d droplets of the product from the container, while still maintaining the remaining product\u2019s full efficacy.\nThe vision for Shiseido\u2019s Synchro Skin Self-Refreshing Foundation was a pump that didn\u2019t look like a traditional pump, that would surprise and delight the consumer.\nHana Innovation has designed and created a 2ml refillable click pen that\u2019s airless, dosage and refillable.\nVirospack recently introduced a first-of-its-kind dropper with a metallic massager tip, which provides an instant cooling effect to skin.\nA patent pending dual-neck vial at Siloa Inc., allows two dispensing systems supporting a single product.\nAn innovative compact design at FusionPKG includes a cover that transforms into a slim, premium brush for a modern, sleek look and unique user experience.\nTo satisfy demands regarding athleisure, WWP recently produced Lululemon\u2019s self-care line of multifunctional products, packaged in \u2018gender neutral\u2019 colors.\nTexen Beauty Partners developed a \u201cbeauty-to-go perfumed paintbrush\u201d for Mugler, which offers a new gesture in fragrance application; it is also refillable.\nThe term \u201cInnovative Packaging\u201d has become increasingly more complex and subject to interpretation. No longer can a product be defined as innovative simply according to its look and function\u2014or even its uniqueness or novelty in the marketplace. Today\u2019s standout beauty products must evoke emotional connections through packaging innovation\u2014and be immediately clear as to how they will be meaningful, practical and problem-solving.\nIt\u2019s in large part a shift from the \u201cdisruptive\u201d innovation mindset that has dominated the design industry for 15 years, to thinking about creating \u201csolutions-based\u201d innovation, according to David Luttenberger, global packaging director, Mintel.\nA practical emotional connection might be one based on how easy or intuitive it is to use, or the package size. A rational emotional connection might be one based on price. The irrational emotional connection is based on want or desire, versus need.\nHaving a new gesture\u2014once viewed as the \u2018holy grail\u2019 of innovation, must today have substance and benefits behind it.\nShiseido\u2019s Jess Abrams, executive director, product development, Global Makeup Center of Excellence & Shiseido Makeup, says, \u201cThere is a fine line between being innovative versus gimmicky, so this becomes a consideration for prestige and luxury brands.\nThe same holds true at Milk Makeup, which was recently included on CEW\u2019s list of Indie65 brands that range from $1 million to $1 billion in size; Milk was named in the $20 million to $50 million category.\n\u201cToday,\u201d says Rhonda Wehbe, senior packaging engineer, Milk Makeup, \u201cinnovations in packaging have come to mean so many different things I don\u2019t know where to begin.\nWehbe says Milk Makeup\u2019s concept of innovation has evolved over the years. \u201cHistorically, innovation for us has been about social change and how we use and think about makeup<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " Top to Toe. They sent me a tester pot which you can see below with enough product to last a couple of weeks.\nCertified Organic with 98% organic ingredients and 2% natural ingredients. The company was founded in 2005 and is based on a small Cornish farm near Falmouth.\nThe products are natural, Fair Trade, not tested on animals, suitable for vegetarians, low carbon footprint and the packaging is recycled and recyclable.\nIf you are in the area you are welcome to drop by during opening hours Monday - Friday. I was in Cornwall last summer wish I'd visited!\nYou can find out more about the company and range of products available here.\nThe body butter is balm like in texture and scented with Alpine Rose & Vanilla. I expected it to be a bit more strongly scented but it has a natural scent due to the butter being made with herbal and botanical infusions rather than perfumes. The scent has grown on me over use. I have also been using it on my face at night - it is deeply nurturing and moisturising - it truly is a top-to-toe product - great for holidays/weekends away due to its multi-purpose use for face and body.\nRetails at \u00a339.65 for 200ml - this size pot would last for ages. It's definitely a product I will purchase at some point as I love its deep moisturising properties, how soft it leaves my skin and the natural ingredients used.\nI had a voucher for Harvey Nichols and decided to treat myself to something. I was thinking something along the lines of an eye shadow or lipstick but I came across Diptyque Eau Rose 20 ml roll on at the SpaceNK counter.\nI adore rose scents as I think I\u2019ve mentioned before. The scent retails at \u00a330 for 20ml or \u00a360 for 100ml. Although I am guessing if this becomes one of my favourite scents its more economical to buy the larger size. There is also a limited edition candle.\nIt\u2019s gorgeous! With top notes of bergamot, blackcurrant and Lychee and middle notes of damask and centifolia roses ending on notes of musk, cedar and honey. The rose notes last and last (although I did re-apply a few times during the course of the day).\nIt comes boxed and encased in a black velvet pouch \u2013 would also make an amazing gift.\nI asked if I could have a sample (SpaceNK usually give a sample(s) with purchase if you ask) and was given \u2013 2ml mini tube NARS Pro-Prime Pore Refining Primer and a 2ml tube NARS Pure Radiant Tinted Moisturiser in Light2 Alaska - not tried either of these products.\nHave you used this scent?\nBourjois Smile Enhancing Gloss \u00a38.99 - read about it here.\nChanel Rouge Coco Shine in Boy.\nMiller Harris Single Note Oil in Rose Absolute.\nGivenchy Mr Radiant.\nShu Uemura Cleansing Oil in Gel.\nSUPER Lush Lips Conditioning Balm.\nTom Ford Beauty Eye Colour Quad.\nI recently went for a Just Be Anti-Ageing Facial. A luxurious treatment which uses a range of products created by Gail Bryden the founder of Just Be.\nThe treatment starts by being asked a few questions about your skin and how it feels at the moment. You then choose your oil (for the neck and shoulder massage - pure bliss!) and your toner out of a choice of two.\nI chose Just be Happy (a blend of pink grapefruit, Lime and Bergamot Essential Oils with Coconut Oil) and Just be Toned Refreshing Toner (with basil and chamomile Essential Oils).\nJust before the treatment you get to smell your oil inhaling deeply for feelings of calm and relaxation.\nThe facial starts with a double deep cleanse using Just be Cleansed - a rich, nourishing balm cleanser scented with geranium, bourbon and petigrain - I own this already and can highly recommend it especially for removing waterproof mascara. It is removed with a warm cloth.\nYour skin is then misted with your chosen toner.\nNext, a pressure point massage using Just be Hydrated, a hydrating serum. The massage stimulates circulation and helps to eliminate toxins and plump up skin.\nAn amazing neck & shoulder massage follows using the Just Be Happy Oil chosen earlier and finally the facial is finished with Just be Radiant Treatment Oil and Just Be Soft Lip Balm.\nMy skin glowed and looked so healthy after this treatment. It costs \u00a345 for 45 minutes. Gail also does various massage treatments. You can read more about these here. I am tempted by the Hawaiian style Lomi Lomi massage next!\nCheck out the online shop for all the products used in my facial. There are also gorgeous treatment candles which when melted can be poured directly onto the skin for massage and amazing body butters. You can see the shop here.\nWeleda products are made from plant, nut and seed oils which help to nourish the skin and promote a sense of wellbeing. Very relaxing and pampering.\n\"our luxurious oils penetrate deep into your skin helping improve your skin's health while pleasing your all of your senses\"\nThe bottle is quite plain - a bit like a medicine bottle!\nGreat product for stress relieving after a hard day either for use either in the bath or for massage or use on wet skin in the shower and then rinse. Calming for use just before bed. Retails at \u00a39.95 for 100ml. This is a close second to my favourite bath oil Bamford Geranium Bath Oil.\nI first came across this shower gel when it was reviewed by The Gloss Goss. I normally pick it up in Poundland, if they've got it instore or Semi-Chem (recently bought in Semi-Chem 2 for \u00a32 instead of \u00a31.79 each).\nWhat's your favourite bargain shower gel?\nNoticed in the Metro this morning that Debenhams have a Clinique bonus time running from 9 - 25 February, yours with the purchase of two or more items, one to be skincare.\nRinse off foaming cleanser - Moisture Surge Extended Thirst Relief - All about Eyes - Dramatically Different Moisturising Lotion - High Impact Mascara in Black - Lip Palette Quad with brush - High Impact Lip Colour in Extreme Pink and Rosette, Buttershine Lipstick in Pinkaboo and Different Lipstick in a Different Grape also included is a cute make up bag.\nThis product retails at \u00a312.50 for 100ml. I bought this in a special pack with 150ml Shea Butter Hand Cream for \u00a325.\nMy hands are so dry at the moment I need all the help I can get! The scrub has been formulated to give you soft and moisturised hands in one minute. The scrub contains brown sugar, 10% shea butter, sweet almond and grapeseed oils.\nStir before use to thoroughly mix the oil and sugar and then use a small blob on dry hands and rub in as if you were washing your hands. Rinse and pat dry. Nicely scented and definitely makes hands feel less dry.\nNo.7 also do a similar product (Revitalising Hand Saviour) which is just as nice and retails at \u00a311 for 75ml (although I tend to buy when Boots are doing their \u00a35 off vouchers).\nI received my Amarya box today - its fab!\nHappiness Travel Candle by NEOM 75g (burn time 20 hours). This particular scent hasn't even launched yet! It is gorgeous - scented with white neroli, mimosa and lemon and retails at \u00a313.\nA full size Zoya nail polish in Kendal worth \u00a310. Really pretty shade.\n15ml tube Essential Care Organic Avocado Replenishing Cream for dry/mature skin. Full size 50ml retails at \u00a318 and a 1.5ml sachet of Essential Care Organic Rose Moisturiser for all skin types (and you can use as an eye cream).\nI am pleased with the box this month - great value for a tenner.

        "passage": "The story of Diptyque began in the very heart of Paris, on the Boulevard Saint-Germain, bringing together three friends with the same creative passion.\nThe company\u2019s founders \u2013 Christiane Gautrot, Desmond Knox-Leet and Yves Couesland \u2013 originally started out in entirely unrelated industries. The first was an interior designer, the second a painter, and the third a theatre director and stage designer.\nFrom designing fabrics and wallpapers together for the Liberty and Sanderson design houses, the trio then opened their own showroom together to present their designs. Yves became the business consultant; Desmond and Christiane were the artistic soul. Step by step, they built a unique space, which, in time, began to offer perfumes and home fragrances alongside their designer home decor. Their lack of experience in the world of perfume was compensated for by enthusiasm. And they succeeded.\nTheir first Eau de Toilette, simply called L\u2019eau, became an instant classic with their customers. Now you will find dozens of products by Diptyque, many of which were created in collaboration with leading global perfumers such as Fabrice Pellegrin or Olivia Giacobetti. Diptyque perfumes are sensual and intoxicating. They emphasise your sex appeal and give you a true feeling of self-confidence.<|endoftext|>"

Has anyone else out there tested this one?\nYes, I went for a FB as soon as I tested it. It\u2019s one of my top 10 perfumes! It lasts forever on me but this seems to be true for most scents I wear.\nYou\u2019re a lucky girl that your scents last so well on you. I mostly smell velvety jammy rose in PHI. Do you get something similar? Not that I can still smell it at this point.\nAlso, have you smelled his Une Rose Chypree? If so, what do you think of that one? I only have samples of PHI and L\u2019air du desert.\nYes, I have tried Rose Chypree but it wasn\u2019t for me. I think I like URdK because it\u2019s not predominantly \u201crosey\u201d on me. I sampled it along with many other rose based fragrances because I found most rose perfumes atrocious (still do!) and I was trying to push my own personal boundaries. It\u2019s just not a note that tends to work for me, unfortunately.\nURdK is almost like a gourmand on me with a bit of tobacco, which is a note I do enjoy. I think the lasting power of most perfumes on my skin is related to environment as well. I live in a very warm and humid area (Florida) so I think a lot of scents hang around longer in a moist dense air. Usually two sprays is my max with one being typical, right on the chest area. When I read of people spray 4,5, or 6 sprays of anything, I am totally astounded and impressed!!\nYou describe this exactly as I have experienced it.\nI\u2019m not a rose fan either and because this is not a front-and-center rose scent \u2013 but I get that lovely apricot-gourmandy but not too sweet mix, I just love it.\nTwo sprays is my max too. It\u2019s a heavy scent on me and I actually prefer to dab vs. spray but lately I\u2019ve found the courage to spray.\nThanks Deva, Perhaps I am interpreting the apricot as jammy. I\u2019m not a huge rose fan either but this one is really pretty.\nI\u2019m right with you.. lasts on me too and a top 10 of mine.\nI\u2019m with Deva. Last Sunday all I had was a sample. Today I have FB and its in my top ten. Couple of sprays and it lasts a good 10 hours.\nToday I wanted a fabulous perfume to start the week, so I\u00b4m wearing vintage Samsara layered with Lush\u00b4s Yes Yes Yes massage bar. I can tell I smell jasminey, lol.\nI\u2019m in Prodigieux Le Parfum by Nuxe and amazed it\u2019s still going strong 8+ hrs later. Such a creamy, yummy scent. I find it very comforting and easy to wear. I\u2019d like to try the oil but I\u2019m not much of a body lotion/oil gal.. and I\u2019m not sure it would be smart for use on my face.\nI\u2019m interested in that one!\nIt\u2019s great in hair, though.\nEmerging from a bad cold & regaining my sense of smell; Slumberhouse Vikt on one wrist, Jeke on the other\u2026Vikt is lighter but camphoraceous enough that I should have tried in in the middle of the cols, Jeke seems to be a PNW Lonestar Memories, which is quite a nice thing. (And both drops shimmer actual green/yellow from my wrists which may not be for everyone).\nThe Slumberhouse line doesn\u2019t seem to activate any lemmings for me based on notes lists, so I\u2019ve never tried any. They just don\u2019t seem like my sort of thing.\nThat said, any stuff strong enough to shimmer green & yellow is really awesome just on principle.\nPdN\u2019s website is kind of a nightmare.\nWent commando to a new Nordstrom with an extended perfume area that is close to me. Not sure if that\u2019s a good or bad thing. I guess we will see when the next damage poll comes around!\nI went to test 2 fragrances only \u2013 Jo Malone Mimosa and Cardamom And Diptique Oud de Palao. I couldn\u2019t get the Jo Malone off fast enough when I got home and in the door. The Oud Palao on the other hand, surprised me. I liked it more than I thought I would, based on some different reviews. Tam Dao and Volutes have been my Diptique friends up to now. I think I will start fresh with this sample in the morning and see how it wears through the day.\nThat\u2019s always a good thing. Imagine how disappointed you would have been if you found something worthy of trying on and you had no available real estate.\nJM was a scrubber for me too. That cumin! Kudos to them for trying to do something a little more bold.\nThat is the exact same experience I had with those same fragrances! In fact I am considering asking for a sample of the diptyque next time I am in nordstroms. The assistant that is at that counter is not very nice or generous and I am not a demanding person, so the fact that I am willing to ask her straight up means I like it! I know some folks love JM but I have not found a single one that works for me. Wait, not true! I did buy a bottle of the Oud and Bergamot dry oil spray and did thoroughly enjoy it but I think because it was an oil. I have no desire for the edt/edp.\nLate to the party today, as I work the evening shift Mondays. SOTD is Grisette by Lubin.\nI\u2019m wearing vintage Helmut Lang for yet another 95 degree October day in LA. Figured it was kind of a weird choice for the heat and dust, but it\u2019s great to smell it again (it was put away for spring and summer). Now that it\u2019s cooled down for the evening and the supermoon is out, I\u2019ve sprayed a bit of Diptyque\u2019s Essences Insens\u00e9es eau de parfum (the jasmine one from this year) over the last bits of the Lang. Working for me on this lovely night.<|endoftext|>"

This scent is very nice and what makes it better is it burns very well. It is made using coconut and beeswax blend, and I think that's the reason. This lovely candle is my favourite currently. I am looking forward to buying other candles for this brand.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Caraonthehill from The scent of summer Treated myself to this (with a little help from my Indulge points) after seeing Sali Hughes recommend it. It smells divine - fresh and summery. It does tunnel a little but you can sort that out as the wax is so soft. It\u2019s lasted well and I\u2019d definitely buy it again.\nRated 4 out of 5 by MaggieFZheng from My new favourite I received this as a gift and Boy Smells is a brand I have not heard before. I was pleasantly surprised how lovely this candle is. The candle burns well and it fills up my living space quickly. The scent is so fresh which is perfect for the spring season. I am looking forward to exploring the brand and trying other scents.\nRated 5 out of 5 by zacanyc from Fresh and unique scent It\u2019s nice to find a candle whose scent doesn\u2019t fall into a floral, musk or overly perfumed category. The candle burns really nicely and the smell is refreshing, and not overpowering. The packaging is really nice as well. A bit \u201ccooler\u201d than what you get with a lot of other candles.\nRated 5 out of 5 by kspils from Luxe Candle Had seen this brand on my travels and so excited when they came to the UK. The Gardener candle smells amazing - floral and refreshing, but not sickly sweet. Has lasted a long time and the packaging is easy on the eye too so looks great on your coffee/bedside table.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Amandab8 from Another fantastic candle from Boy Smells! The quality of wax and really interesting blends of aroma make Boy Smells my new favourite candle brand. This candle is so interesting and is a very unique kind of smell. Fresh yet complex this is a great *background* kind of smell that isn't easily identifiable but really beautifully rounded.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Jolilyflower from Read about it and it is all that. I read an independent review on these candles and this scent was recommended. It\u2019s beautiful. Filled the room with it delicious scent and lasted hours after being burnt. The packaging is on point and it\u2019s a beautiful gift to yourself or another. Yes please to any candle this brand makes.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Eesha from This candle is beautiful This candle smells so fresh and like a garden - I love it now it's autumn and I can't go outside as much. It gives a lovely clean burn as long as you allow top layer to melt completely. I am very picky about candles but I will definitely buy more from this brand.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Pigle82 from Awesome kitchen candle! This is what I always think of as a kitchen candle as it's fresh and uplifting with a little bit of warmth. It looks cute and the scent throw is quite incredible with these candles. So happy I can finally buy these easily!!! Worth every single penny.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Last Friday I flew to Stockholm for a long weekend, which included a solo sniffing trip in Stockholm's finest perfume emporia. But before leaving Liverpool airport, I had a little nosey round the Duty Free there to see what new releases they had which my local outlets had not yet caught up with. So I tried Victor & Rolf's Eau Mega, undaunted by the incredibly naff chocolate money top thingy, and it was much as I expected - big pear note, been there, sniffed that. I also had a spritz of D & G Rose The One, and in the opening I got a fleeting but very true representation of a rose, swathed in a green and powdery accord, but then I lost it and thought that maybe this is your run-of-the-mill designer rose scent after all. So the jury's out on that one till I can test it again...\nFast forward to Saturday lunchtime, which finds me in Stockholm's top department store, NK, which I would liken to Selfridges in the UK and Neiman Marcus in the USA. It had a designer section which flowed seamlessly into a more niche area, which in turn flowed into a concession of Cow, a high end and funky cosmetics and perfume chain. Within this relatively compact area I was immediately struck by the preponderance of bath and body products from brands such as Voluspa, Abahna, La Source, Compagnie de Provence, Crabtree & Evelyn, India Hicks, Harn, Molton Brown and the quirkily named \"Bj\u00f6rk & Berries\". I had always thought as much, but the profusion of such brands was definite proof that the Swedes are indeed a very clean nation.\nIn terms of niche fragrances, for NK proper as opposed to the Cow concession I spotted the following: Diptyque, Apothia, Keiko Mecheri, Acqua di Parma, Piguet, Juliette has a Gun, Costume National, Bond No 9, Creed, M Micallef, Neotantric Fragrances, Library of Fragrance, Byredo and CLEAN, and possibly a few more I missed. Looking back, that is quite an unusual mix of brands which I have never seen together anywhere else in Europe... The Byredo counter didn't have the new Baudelaire, but sent me over to the menswear department(!), where, right in the midst of the suiting and booting, there was a stand with men's colognes, including Byredo. Baudelaire also smelt as I imagined from what I had read of it so far: a bit spicy, dusty and fundamentally blokey, so thumbs down to that one too.\nIn the designer area I at last tried a scent I have been curious about for some time, because it contains some of my favourite notes - Helena Rubinstein's Wanted. In the event it was a very pleasant blur on my wrist, not because I can't recall it properly but because it was innately blurry in style. I asked for a sample, but to no avail. I don't suppose I'll miss it, but I would have liked to have given it another shot.\nSpace constraints meant that Cow didn't stock the full range of some of these lines - not that I carried out an inventory as such! - but that was my impression. My first question was: \"Do you have Havana Vanille?\" and the answer was sadly not. So I contented myself with a sniff of CdG's Daphne on skin, which was a disagreeable spicy number. I also tried (from the Red series) Carnation and Harissa. Both were as fiery as I thought they would be, and if you were a carnation lover (which I am not), Carnation did seem to me to be the real deal. Then I had a little spritz on skin of CB I hate Perfume's At The Beach 1966, and rather liked it, but didn't ask for a sample because the SA was tied up with cosmetics customers at the crucial moment. I wondered whether to dabble in the Humiecki & Graef line, but the reviews - and odd names (Skarb / Geste / Askew!) - had rather put me off.\nThe final stop was the new Byredo store in the same street. It was small and clinically white, and they had mini bottles containing the top, heart and base notes of each of their range, as well as the finished compositions. By way of experiment, I sniffed the three bottles that make up Fantastic Man, which was mildly interesting but ultimately pointless, as the scent for sale is after all the blended version rather than its component parts. So I asked for a sample of it instead (to give to a male friend), and after some concerted rummaging in drawers, the SA drew a blank. So I decided to call it a day at that point and went for a long walk on one of Stockholm's many islands, before heading out later that night in a curious Wanted-Daphne-L'Eau Nirique-Fantastic Man-Ta'if melange.\nThen yesterday at Skavsta airport I dared to test not one but three of the Neotantric range of fragrances, which I realised just today are actually Swedish. It was a bit early frankly to try perfumes with such wanton names as Manic Love (Women), Sex Goddess and Dropps of Me (I swear there were two \"p\"s on the tester bottle). All three were unspeakably awful in ways I am not sure I can accurately convey. All I will say is that if you are tempted by the wacky names to try these yourselves, please resist the urge, for they will spoil your day. I also retested Gucci Flora, and though the drydown was quite inoffensive - pleasant even - at some point in the development there was a discordant note that troubled me. Badass patchouli maybe?\nSo in summary I would observe that the Swedes are very hygienic (I even saw the CLEAN range at the bus station!), not averse to whimsy or eroticism as exemplified in the Neotantric range, while the lack of samples confirms my belief that things in Scandinavia are only available at a very high price - as in a full bottle purchase - which in turn would have cost up to twice as much as in Britain.\nBut you have gotta love a city whose underground network includes stations named Bro, Tibble, Sockenplan and the splendidly Star Trekky Nockeby Torg. I'll be back, and next time I'll bring my own empty sample vials...\nDelightful! Thanks for the lovely story. Now please tell us, did you try Cumming after all? And if so, what did you think of it? It is definitely a male scent but my goodness, it is wonderfully different.\nAh, I bottled it, I am afraid - as in chickened out - not as in acquiring a bottle of this scent! From your positive description it sounds as though I should have been bolder...\n\"Wanna gimme??\" FAOK - The Rise of Forced Acts of...\nA Probably Preposterous Notion - The Unrepresentat...\n<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "The Upper East Side is well-known for its wealthy residents and upscale high-rises. Following close behind are the strings of designer shops and high-end department stores on the world-famous Madison Avenue. Think Louis Vuitton, Tiffany and Co., Prada, Valentino and many more, they have it. Although it may be a shopping spot for those willing to splurge, a wander down Madison Avenue allows for a true New York window shopping experience.\nWith each turn of the season, department stores like Saks Fifth Avenue, Barney\u2019s and Bergdorf Goodman will update their windows with lavish displays \u2013 which attract thousands of people each year. A little tip \u2013 the further uptown you walk, the pricier the stores.\nSoHo, abbreviated from South of Houston Street, is an energetic neighbourhood filled with trendy shops and cafes \u2013 all worthy of an Instagram post. The area has a decent mixture of all types: fast fashion brands like Zara, art book publishers like Taschen and mainstream finds like Levi\u2019s. It\u2019s a neighbourhood ideal for those who like to explore by foot, and certainly a lot less crowded than Madison Avenue. What stands out the most in SoHo, in terms of shopping, is its cluster of cult brands such as Reformation, Glossier, American Two Shot\u2026 just to name a few. Visit these stores to enhance your cool-girl/boy/human status. The hotels located around SoHo are pretty cool too, ranging from cheap to luxury.\nNolita, short for North of Little Italy, is the less-visited counterpart of SoHo. The neighbourhood exudes a charming, trendy atmosphere, which is fairly obvious by the mobs of stylish people who strut about the streets. Composed of narrow streets and carefully curated window displays, Nolita boasts boutiques such as Vince, warm, Babel Fair, Lingo, which all sell curated selections of women\u2019s and menswear. Those are just a handful of the boutiques this area has to offer; if you fancy just wandering around, you\u2019re sure to come across excellent boutiques on your own.\nEast Village may not seem like the first choice for a day of shopping, but if you\u2019re one of those people who finds pleasure in past trends, the shops in this area will delight you. East Village is often noted as one of the few places in Manhattan that still has quirky character; it\u2019s full of strange little nooks where you can escape into different worlds. Transport into retro-world when you visit Cloak & Dagger \u2013 a shop offering below $100 pieces reminiscent of Wes Anderson characters. Other charismatic shops include Cobblestones and VideoGamesNewYork \u2013 a walk-in-closet-sized shop filled with games from across the years.\nCanal Street is a popular place to go for people eyeing a designer-looking bag they can\u2019t afford. The makeshift stalls here sell everything from \u201cdesigner\u201d handbags and wallets to watches and perfumes. Visiting these stalls is as much an attraction in itself \u2013 vendors are eccentric and friendly and you\u2019ll often hear funny conversations between themselves. Whether you believe they\u2019re real or not, it\u2019s a different side of New York to the glossy streets of Upper East Side. Choose a hotel located in Chinatown if you'd like to stay closeby.\nNot all the products here are genuine, but make sure you know the difference between counterfeit and knock-off pieces; counterfeit bags are the same in model, colour and logo whilst the latter are imitations \u201cinspired\u201d by the originals.\nWest Village, home to the famous Bleecker Street and the historic Greenwich Village, holds a mixture of chic boutiques and well-known brands. Found amongst the meandering streets of this area are popular brands like Diptyque and C.O. Bigelow, to fulfill all your home d\u00e9cor needs. Hidden treasures include Madame Matovu, which can be pretty expensive but when it\u2019s vintage high-end discards \u2013 who cares. For trend-setting brands, check out Maison Margiela and Urban Zen (Donna Karan\u2019s new baby circa 2015).\nWilliamsburg, found in the almost-too-cool Brooklyn, is sprawling with amazing vintage and thrift shops. This neighbourhood is well worth trekking over the Brooklyn Bridge \u2013 not just for the great shopping but also, for its ever-growing supply of delicious restaurants and cafes, as well as upcoming art galleries. A true mecca for vintage-lovers, you can find two sources of vintage goods: stores and marketplaces. Check out Beacon\u2019s Closet, a staple vintage stores, and the much-loved Artist & Fleas marketplace and Brooklyn Flea Market. You'll find a good variety of hotels dotted around the neighbourhood, perfect for your stay.\nPark Slope is that shy but trendy friend who\u2019s far too modest but has all the coolest and newest clothes. When you think Fifth Avenue, the doors of Tiffany and Co. probably spring to mind, but in Park Slope\u2019s case \u2013 Fifth Avenue marks a flurry of independent fashion shops selling one-of-a-kind items. Shopping in this area sees you among vintage troves in the form of brownstone buildings; make sure you snap a picture of this Brooklyn aesthetic. Pay a visit to Bird, another fabulous Beacon\u2019s Closet and Diana Kane.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "So this month has flown by. Luckily it seems I've used up quite a good amount in what seems such a short space of time so I'm happy nonetheless. Also, for the first time in ages I've finished up candles. It's a rare occasion but it feels so good. As that is a monumental thing I'm going to start with those.\nYankee Candles are my favourite, I'll just come out and say it. I don't understand all the fuss over brands such as Diptyque and Jo Malone; it's literally a lot of money to burn and the scents are nothing to write home about. Mini rant over.\nThe two scents I've used are Banana Cream Cake and Pineapple Cilantro and oh my were they good. I'm a fruity scent gal through and through and these smelt so delicious I can't even begin to describe. Yum. I already have a back up of the Pineapple Cilantro but I'm sad to say that Banana Cream Cake was a limited edition so there's no chance of me getting my paws on it. Sad face. At \u00a319.99 they aren't the cheapest but I've been burning these for ages and the smells are so true to life they can't be beat. If you're in the market for a candle I'd definitely check out the Yankee Candle website. Definitely damaging to the wallet.\nThe Clinique Clarifying Lotion has been in my stash for yonks, I recently tried it again and no surprise the results were terrible. The remaining 1/4 of it went down the sink and I will never be purchasing this again nor would I recommend it. I would actually suggest you actively avoid this product at all costs. Awful.\nAnother terrible product is the Scrub Of Your Life by Soap and Glory.  It's a foaming scrub which to me resulted in two things - minimal scrubbing action and dry, dry skin. After two uses on my body this stuff took pride of place cleaning my feet. I don't know what it is but Soap and Glory as a brand are no longer on my radar and I'm so underwhelmed by their line now that I've tried out better alternatives.\nWith all that bad, there has to be some good and that comes courtesy of John Frieda. I finished the matching conditioner of this last month and now the shampoo has finally joined it. I love everything about this line I'll be honest. For reviving my blonde it works a treat. In terms of the shampoo, the only gripe I have is that it doesn't lather too well but that's being picky.\nIt wouldn't be an empties post without some Body Shop bits now would it. Not one to disappoint I have another three this month. The Papaya Body Butter has been keeping me soft and smooth this month and it's been a delight. What I liked most was that the fruity scent was subtle so it never interfered with my perfume. These body butters are always winners though.\nNext up is the Honeymania Bubble Bath Melt. My love for this product knows no bounds. It smells delightful and produces a mountain of bubbles. As always nothing's perfect and I think it's obvious that the packaging lets it down a bit. When it's full it's really easy to pour out the desired amount but as you get closer to the bottom it takes a while. Nevertheless it's lovely and I would recommend giving it a whirl.\nLastly is what has come to be my pick of the bunch when it comes to body scrubs. The Pink Grapefruit scrub has a gelee texture that is a dream to work with. It scrubs amazingly and leaves no residue whatsoever. I've been so underwhelmed by scrubs lately that it's nice to finally find a product that ticks all the boxes for me. I feel like a repurchase might be imminent.\nOnto the last bits. I purchased the Norwegian Formula hand cream purely for the fact it had SPF. Overall I really like it but I have to be really careful not to apply too much as it has a tendency to peel a little if you go overboard. I will repurchase again purely for the SPF, as it's so hard to find a hand cream with SPF.\nOrigins Make A Difference Plus has been my day/night cream for a while now and while I enjoyed using it I wouldn't repurchase. I saw a difference in my skin, but nothing that I wouldn't have saw using any other moisturiser. I also prefer to use different creams for day/ night as my skins needs are different. While I wouldn't necessarily repurchase this one, I have gone back to the Origins brand so keep your eyes peeled for this guys replacement.\nLast but not least is a product I had high hopes for. Purity Made Simple is a cult cleanser if I believe the hype. Having tried it, i'd say it does no more than any other basic cleanser. It didn't wow me and for the price, I definitely need to be wowed. If you've been thinking about purchasing this, try get a sample or the small size to give it a road test before committing to a larger bottle.\nSo that's all for this month. I'm really enjoying these monthly updates. I feel like I'm making good progress on my stash and it's nice to be able to buy new things totally guilt free.\nLet me know what you guys have been finishing up lately, I always love to hear.\nGreat post :) I love Yankee candles!<|endoftext|>"

Thanks for the drawing!\nWow, I\u2019m intrigued by La Corte with the almond and jasmine.\nI live in the US. The worst thing I\u2019ve tried on this year was Olympea with its screeching white floral. The worst part: it was a blind buy.\nI live in the US and my favorite designer exclusive is Mitzah. One of the worst things I\u2019ve smelled this year was Diptyque Oud Palao.\nHey Robin- I live not too far from you in the USA!  It is not for me, but it is a great gateway into an iconic fragrance for someone like my beautiful 20-something niece. And, I do love, love, love 31 Rue Cambon.\nI live in the US. So far my favorite luxury designer fragrance is Oud Ispahan. As always, thanks for the giveaways!\nThanks for the giveaway, Robin!\nMy favorite luxury designer fragrance? Tough one. I\u2019d probably say Bois des Iles/Chanel or Bottega Veneta, the original.\nLiving in the United States I am free to try Dior Sauvage as many times as I like with high hopes that my opinion will change. It hasn\u2019t. \nI live in the United/divided States. After months away from fragrance pursuits, I\u2019m preparing to start sampling again during the winter when no longer blitzed by renovation projects. I need to smell new things.\nI live in Believeland (AKA Cleveland, Ohio for you non-sports followers). Favorite luxury designer fragrance would have to be 31 Rue Cambon.\nI live in the US and my favorite luxury designer fragrance is Chanel No. 5 (or maybe 19?).\nI live in the US. Favorite luxury designer fragrance: Guerlain Songe d\u2019ue Bois d\u2019Ete. Worst thing I smelled this year: Smellbent Little Miss Panda.\nMy local boutique pharmacy just started carrying an extensive collection of Demeter perfumes. I sampled a few of the non-traditional scents and have to say Demeter Beetroot is definitely the worst thing I\u2019ve smelled this year. I live in the US.\nHi, I live in the US.\nThe worst fragrance I\u2019ve smelled in 2016 is Orto Parisi Seminalis. Of all the hundreds of fragrances I\u2019ve sampled over the years, it\u2019s the only one that has literally made me nauseous!\nI live in the US. I don\u2019t know whether Mary Greenwell Plum counts as a luxury designer fragrance, but it is my favorite. This year. Last year. Hmmm. Maybe even the year prior.\nI\u2019m in the US and my favorite luxury fragrance (at least at the moment) is Hermes Hiris. The worst thing I\u2019ve smelled in a while is Penhaligon\u2019s Blasted Bloom.\nI live in the US \u2013 yay for fall in New England! The worst perfume I smelled in 2016 was Marc Jacobs Decadence.\nHi, I\u2019m in the US. Favorite luxury scent right now would be Thierry Mugler Over the Musk!\nI live in the US. I will clearly be beaten for saying this, but the worst fragrance I\u2019ve smelled in 2016 is the Chanel L\u2019eau. Maybe my sample is bad? It doesn\u2019t feel like a cohesive, completed perfume to me. On my skin, the dry down falls apart.\nI\u2019ve heard positive things about this series. Here\u2019s hoping that I win!\nHi! I am in the US. My favorite luxury fragrance would be Chanel Coromandel. I think the thing I wanted to like but was truly repulsed by this year was SJP Slash.\nI live in US. Hermes is my fragrance house and a complete Ellena fan and I would say that Eau de Narcisse Bleu is one of the pleasant surprises that hides beneath the surface of the brand.\nI live in the US. I\u2019d say Tom Ford counts as luxury, and my favorite is Orchid Soleil.\nNot a typical tale of fragrance, but one funny olfactory anecdote\u2026 I teach art in a boarding school, including a senior studio program where the students can get kind of experimental with materials\u2026 Last year one student routinely burned incense (I think she incorporated the dust into collages) while wearing a vanilla & patchouli-laced perfume\u2026 More recently, a student had singed some sections of acrylic textile in a room where there was a still-life set up with rather ripe lilies\u2026 Oddly enough, both of these phenomena triggered olfactory hallucinations of Habit Rouge, perhaps one of my favourite scents I\u2019ve never actually owned a FB of. I guess you can be literally haunted by a fragrance?\nI live in the USA and my favorite luxury fragrance is Amouage Epic Man!\nHi! I am in NY NY and I absolutely hated Dylan Blue! Yuck!!! Thanks for this lovely opportunity!\nOooh almond milk I am in the US, and my favorite most recently discovered luxury fragrance is Chanel Box of Eels (i.e. Bois des Iles). Thank you for the giveaway!\nThese sound lovely! I am in the U.S., and this year I discovered the fabulous Hermes Galop.\nThe fragrance is not new, but this summer I\u2019ve discovered that I need to have Chanel Sycomore. I can provide an US address.\nThanks, Robin. I live in the US and the worst fragrance I\u2019ve smelled so far this year was one of the little Pinrose samples I got. It wasn\u2019t horrible in an offensive and off-putting way like other perfumes I\u2019ve tried, but was so bland, obviously rolled out for mass basic appeal rather than any sort of character\u2026 It was just depressing and I wouldn\u2019t let my daughter walk out of the house with it on.\nHi, I live in the US. My favorite luxury designer scent is a toss-up between Cuir Beluga, Bois des Iles and Angelique Noire. Hard time thinking of what I detested. I usually try to only remember the ones I like. There isn\u2019t enough room in the brain for something bad. Thanks for the drawing!\nI live in the U.S. and you have permission to use my email address. I like many designer fragrances but am right now infatuated with two from Zegna: Haitian Vetiver and Incense Gold. I think Dior Savage stinks.\nI live in the US. Worst fragrance I\u2019ve smelled this year is Katy Perry\u2019s Purr. It\u2019s peach flavored cough syrup. These should be a warning for diabetics on the bottle.\nI live in the US in NYC, and I am happily wearing my Hermes Bel Ami. I am still on the fence, but the dirtiest one of the Juniper Ride, something Canyon I think, I went out and bought it precisely for the skank factor. I wore it Memorial Day weekend at the beach and have not worn it again since. It truly wears like full on offensive BO and I am not sure when or where I can wear it again, but I do love knowing that it is there in my fragrance cabinet whenever I want to smell like civet/bo on crack.\nI am in the US and enjoyed reading the bests and worsts listed in the comments so far. My worst fragrance this year was Glade Hawaiian Breeze room spray, a mix of chemical flowers and artificial pineapple in a can. Sorry to anyone who loves it. You can have mine.\nI Live in the US, E-Mail is up to date. So far, haven\u2019t smelled anything Dreckful this year. Favorite from a Luxury brand\u2026 Champaca Absolute or White Patchouli from Tom Ford. And I have to say that I Really REALLY Like Versace Dylan Blue and that it<|endoftext|>"

The trio includes three individually wrapped candles in Biblioth\u00e8que, Cotton Poplin and Fleur Fant\u00f4me. This specific set is currently exclusive to Net-A-Porter and Byredo.com ($120 for the set) but you can buy them individually in the mini size and full sizes at select locations. Based on what I\u2019ve seen in person, stores seem to have limited inventory of the minis. Each mini has 8.4 oz /70 g with an approximate burn time of 14 hours each although I haven\u2019t timed my burn lengths.\nThe three mini candles all have extremely good throw even at the small size. Based on my experience with the full-sized Fleur Fant\u00f4me, I can say the mini is just as strong in scent once it is burned. I\u2019ve burned each of the minis over the past few weeks. These are lovely unique home scents but my heart still belongs to Diptyque and Henri Bendel.\nBiblioth\u00e8que mimics the Bal D\u2019Afrique perfume.

        "passage": "It would seem that after a rather intense Indian summer, autumn is set to start rolling in next week. And, as we prepare for 10-degree drops and chilly winds, is anyone starting to feel a bit (dare I say it) excited? Trust me\u2014I love summer as much as the next person, but there is something really quite wonderful about the few weeks that come after summer, before the beating winds and drizzle blow in when the air is crisp and cool but the sun is still shining.\nAnd after six months of wishing that being outside felt a little bit more normal, I\u2019ve never been more ready to baton down the hatches and get into full-blown nesting mode. Of course, in true beauty-editor style, while some prepare to throw themselves into home DIY projects and baking experiments, I\u2019m getting stuck into planning my autumn beauty routine.\nAfter a summer of often uncomfortable climes, I\u2019m ready to start giving my body the TLC it deserves once more. If anything, for me, a drop in temperature at the start of autumn is simply an excuse to whip out the most luxurious beauty products I own and embrace a bit of self-care ahead cosy evenings on the sofa. With me? Keep scrolling for the go-to beauty products I love to phase back into my routine come autumn.\nI always look forward to this release. In fact, it\u2019s probably my favourite beauty launch of the year. The Body Shop\u2019s Vanilla Pumpkin range smells sweet but not eye-wateringly sickly like so many other seasonal beauty offerings. To be quite honest, I spend the second half of August counting down the days until I can start cocooning myself limbs in this nourishing cream.\nAnyone that knows me knows that this is in my top five beauty products ever created. However, come summer, I usually reach for a zesty gel over this skin-softening oil. The minute the mercury drops below 20 though, this stuff comes straight back out. It\u2019s lightweight but nourishing and comforting in the best way possible. And it smells absolutely divine.\nSpeaking of stressed-out skin, the change in temperature wreaks havoc with my complexion. Adding a soothing serum into my daily routine is absolutely essential if I want to minimise redness and irritation. This year, Aurelia\u2019s new CBD-infused serum is my reach-for. It\u2019s wonderfully calming and feeds my skin just the right amount of hydration.\nName me a better feeling that closing the curtains on an autumn evening and lighting the most comforting candle in your collection. Every year, I struggle to get my hands on Diptyque\u2019s Limited Edition city candles (they only sell them in the boutiques of the relevant city and sell out online super-quickly). However, because of current circumstances, this year the entire collection is available to shop online from 17to 27September. I have spent years longing to get my hands on the New York scent, and this year my time has come. Trust me, the warm, woody but slightly spicy aroma was totally worth the wait.\nMy oily, sensitive skin doesn\u2019t really lend itself to irritating, breakout-inducing facial oils, however that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want to revel in their beauty whenever my skin starts to dry up a little. This new formula from Willowberry, however, is specifically formulated with chia and rosehip for sensitive skin, and it could just revolutionise my autumn routine.\nAlthough my autumn skin and bodycare routine might seem a bit extra, when it comes to makeup in the autumn, I take a much more laissez-faire approach. Glowing skin, fluffy brows and a hint of colour on my lips is my go-to look, but wooly jumpers/blankets and sticky lip products don\u2019t tend to mix. Instead, my autumn lip collection consists of non-drying, budge-proof stains, much like this one.\nIt might seem obvious, but slathering on a super-hydrating face mask is one of my favourite things to do come autumn. This new launch from one of my favourite bodycare brands (it now offers facial skincare, too) contains hydrating milk, soothing oat and hyaluronic acid to help tackle dry skin, as well as a special complex to help skin renewal and barrier function.\nI really love fresh, zesty fragrances, but come autumn there is definitely something to be said for a slightly headier, warmer scent. Each year, I opt for a different autumnal spritz. This time around, this deeply warming perfume is set to be my go-to. With delicately floral top and middle notes, its base comprises of ambrette, tonka, vanilla bourbon and cedarwood for a rich, comforting finish.\nMy dry lips freak out at the best of times, but a sudden drop in temperature is sure to leave them cracked and uncomfortable. Recently, I discovered that my favourite Lanolips balm comes in a stick, ideal for when I\u2019m out and about and don\u2019t want to touch my face. It\u2019s my new all-time favourite.\nFinding new ways to amp up my glow is quite honestly one of my favourite pastimes. Come autumn, I always find myself reaching for a rich, moisturising primer. This new addition to my collection is set to become one of my autumn staples thanks to its plumping finish and rich, creamy scent. Up next, why this full-coverage foundation has cult status.\nTiny Attends Party And Confronts Her Husband TI\u2019s Number 1 SIDE CHICK!!<|endoftext|>"

It's hard to believe that it's been less than 20 years since brands across markets collectively decided to drop their prices for the one-day-only shop-till-you-drop madness. Since then, as online shopping has surpassed in-store (because, of course, one requires pants and one doesn't), brands have extended their deals to last the entire Thanksgiving weekend. But companies can be pretty cagey about releasing the exact details of their deals ahead of time.\nEvery year, fragrances are some of the most popular beauty gifts to give and receive, but they can also be incredibly pricey, making Black Friday the perfect time to shop. Not every one of your favorite perfume brands is hosting a Black Friday deal though, and many of the ones that are have decided to keep them top-secret until the day after Thanksgiving. So we had to do some major sleuthing just to find the following nine Black Friday perfume deals. Check back over the next few days as we continue to get the scoop, and in the meantime, shop nine amazing Black Friday perfume deals below.\nDiana Vreeland's colorful, theatrical fragrances would make the ideal holiday gift for the glamazon in your life, especially since the official brand site will be offering a full size of its luxurious body cream (a $125 value) with the purchase of any bottle of fragrance on Black Friday.\nFrom Monday, November 19, through Saturday, November 24, Byrdie editor\u2013favorite makeup brand Charlotte Tilbury will be giving away bottles of its signature floral fragrance if you spend enough cash on the brand's site.

Instead of $52, it'll be $39. The romantic blend of strawberry, rose petal, and macaron smells exactly like a stroll through the Marais.\nLuxurious but affordable, Philosophy's line of light, hypnotic scents makes for great gifts even without the discount, but on Black Friday, you'll get 40% off your order from the brand's website, plus 100 loyalty bonus points, when you spend $75 or more.

I would pick a few flowers and bring them to my hotel in the evening, and the following day I would wake to a suave scent wafting through the room.\nPerfumer Sophia Grojsman, whom I\u2019m fortunate to count among my mentors, once said: \u201cRose petals have a luxurious, rich smell that is, at the same time, familiar.\u201d This combination of the recognisable and the exotic is one of the reasons why rose remains a beloved perfume ingredient and Bulgarian essence, with its many nuances, in demand. A fragrance like La Rose de Rosine (\u20ac120 for 100ml EDP) by Les Parfums de Rosine features Bulgarian essence unvarnished, accenting the pink flower\u2019s sweetness with violet, jasmine and tonka bean. Annick Goutal Rose Absolue ($167 for 100ml EDP) is likewise an \u201ceverything coming up roses\u201d story, with the Bulgarian rose at the heart of the composition. It smells natural and delicate, like freshly plucked blossom.\nStudying with Grojsman, I\u2019ve grown to appreciate the versatility of the rose and its ability to acquire different tones, depending on the other ingredients in the formula. In Saint Laurent Paris (\u00a365 for 50ml EDP), Grojsman used the rose accord to capture the heady feeling of being in love, while in her equally famous Lanc\u00f4me Tr\u00e9sor (\u00a354 for 30ml EDP) she conveyed the sensation of a warm embrace. If Paris has the effervescence of champagne, Tr\u00e9sor suggests the lushness of Sauternes.\nShowing a similar complexity is Diptyque\u2019s L\u2019Ombre Dans L\u2019Eau (\u00a370 for 50ml EDT) by Serge Kalouguine. The perfumer paired the fruity warmth of Bulgarian roses with the tartness of blackcurrants \u2013 an original choice. The effect is darkly green and bittersweet, with a subtle honeyed undercurrent. It\u2019s the olfactory equivalent of Monet\u2019s paintings, and its mood changes from light to dark, airy to seductive, as the scent evolves. I\u2019ve been wearing L\u2019Ombre Dans L\u2019Eau for several years and keep finding new elements in it \u2013 a touch of wood, a whisper of musk, a twist of blackberry. As Grojsman would say: \u201cThough it may seem familiar, rose holds many secrets.\u201d Discovering them is a pleasure.\nVictoria Frolova has been writing her perfume blog boisdejasmin.com since 2005. Her explorations of fragrance touch upon all elements that make this subject rich and complex: science, art, literature, history and culture.

Pharmacies nationwide.\nFirst created in 1927 by Francois Coty for his wife, L\u2019Aimant Parfum de Toilette had many comparisons with another very famous rose and aldehydes perfume launched a few years earlier.\nElegant and feminine, it remains as beautiful today as it did then, for a 50ml bottle that costs less than \u20ac20, it can\u2019t be beaten. Boots & select stores.\nPortrait of a Lady, Viktor & Rolf Flowerbomb, La Vie Est Belle, all bestsellers by perfumer Dominique Ropion, one of the two noses on this 2003 creation Amor Amor for Cacharel.\nPink grapefruit, juicy blackcurrant, even a Coke accord are in this juice, alongside jasmine, rose, vanilla, and musk. A fruity floral that is anything but boring.\nOlivier Pescheux is the perfumer behind plenty of Diptyque fragrances, and Gucci Million, he worked with H&M on their fragrance line.\nComoro Ylang is a fruity, spicy floral with a powdery finish. The fragrance line isn\u2019t on the Irish site at present but you can pick up this rollerball of perfume oil for pulse points for just shy of \u20ac10. Try it with another fragrance or by itself.\nSunshine in a bottle, NUXE Delicious Fragrance Water is more in the style of the Roger & Gallet scent as a hair and body spritz.\nWith 85.6% natural ingredients, it contains uplifting coconut, sweet orange, petitgrain, Tiare Flowers, vanilla, and musk. Unbeatable for recalling the Summer and beach days, spritz on the body and add a little to the hair for a happier day all round. Pharmacies nationwide.<|endoftext|>"

They're ideal for inhabiting small spaces, taking your favorite scent with you in your purse or car, and decluttering your space. Mini bottles of product are multipurpose, and that's most certainly the case with the launch of iconic parfumerie diptyque's Nomadic Sprays. While the name may suggest otherwise, there's no boarding pass necessary for making the most of these small bottles at home.\nThe release currently includes four classic fragrances to choose from. The Travel Spray bottle can come filled with Do Son, Eau Rose, Eau des Sens, or Philosykos eau de toilette for $115. And while the fragrances have similarities, they're unique enough to cater to a wide range of perfume lovers.\nDo Son has a warm undertone of amber wood and is inspired by the tuberoses of Ha Long Bay in Vietnam, consisting of orange blossom, jasmine, and tuberose. Eau Rose is a classic rose fragrance that's infused with a mix of fruity notes, which is similar to Eau des Sens, another florally option, but with a muskier scent thanks to patchouli.\nIf you'd prefer something reminiscent of the Mediterranean, Philosykos is as Greek as its name sounds, embodying the scent of fig, a popular plant on many of the islands. The scents help whisk you away to faraway locations, and although you may not be jet-setting in person right now, the sleek black scent bottles still come in handy.\nAt just 12 milliliters, the bottles are the perfect size for stowing in your purse, shirt pockets, crowded bathroom cabinets, or your car's glovebox. They also help clean up shelves and vanities of beauty products that are looking a bit more cluttered than usual. These aren't your classic one-time use travel containers either, but rather a unique version that can be refilled through the bottom and customized with reusable letters to label your fragrance and mark it as yours.\nAhead, shop all four of the fragrances in their new travel-size versions.<|endoftext|>"

Promising all kinds of advantages for teeth and gums as well as general health, oil-pulling has many celebrity advocates who claim it helps whiten teeth, freshen breath, loosen jaw muscles and kill harmful bacteria in the mouth.The most popularly used pulling product is coconut oil, but olive oil and sesame oil are also believed to be effective. Some people choose to pull with standard oils, but there are now some wonderful oil pulling products on the market containing heaps of beneficial ingredients without any harsh flavours or added alcohol. Check out our ranking of the top ten oil pulling products available this year and see how quickly you notice results!\nOily skin happens when the sebaceous glands make too much sebum, which can lead to a shiny or greasy appearance, clogged or open pores, and acne. However, sebum is also vital for keeping the skin healthy, as it protects and hydrates the skin. A well-chosen skincare routine can help to get oily skin under control, whilst respecting and working with the skin's natural defences.Oily skin still gets dehydrated and the right face moisturiser can help restore balance. We've created this buying guide including a list of our top ten products for those with oily, combination-oily, and acne-prone skin.

An age-old beauty secret in India, it's one of those products that's been around for a while but has flown under the radar outside of those in the know! Hair oil may seem like quite a specific thing for those who 'need' it or know how to use it, but it's actually something that most people, even those with fine hair or men with hair loss concerns, could do to try.Hair oils are the perfect potion for lots of different hair types, but are particularly good for those with dry hair or dandruff-prone scalps, as well as coarse, frizzy, afro, or curly hair, and those with chemically-treated or relaxed hair, too.

        "passage": "Many Australians (not to mention Europeans) will stick close to home this festive season with the increased uncertainty and hassle triggered by omicron.\nNevertheless, airlines are continuing to try to ramp up operations, with many carriers now flying around half their pre-pandemic route traffic. Singapore Airlines reports it\u2019s back to 43 per cent of its 2019 flight volume, with a 250 per cent increase in business ex-Australia over the past month.\nAn increased focus on healthy plant-based food in the air is a key theme as airlines encourage people to fly again. Pictured here, a waiter offers homemade lemonade at Darwin International Airport\u2019s pop-up Qantas Catalina Lounge.\nHow to encourage travellers to unleash their inner \u201cpent-up demand\u201d \u2013 particularly at the more lucrative pointy end \u2013 is akin to a soft arms race in the air.\nAll the usual enticements are being rolled out: Singapore Airlines recently unveiled its new amenity kits by British perfumer Penhaligon\u2019s, while Qatar Airways has gone with French brand diptyque as its supplier. American Airlines partnered with the heady on-trend scents by New York perfumer DS&Durga, packaged in reusable bags by Detroit-based Shinola, for a fresh look in its toiletries department.\nReducing touch points and increasing digital options onboard (including for menus and entertainment programming) is a no-brainer.\nThen there\u2019s the big trend for more privacy in the air, prompting the big Middle Eastern carriers Emirates and Qatar to add to their respective private jet fleets. That service is at odds with the very real race to make aviation more sustainable: Cue Etihad\u2019s strategic sustainability flight program, and Qantas\u2019 commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050.\nTurning to in-flight passenger comfort, let\u2019s not forget that as many airlines phase out their A380s, the focus is on keeping business class passengers well-spaced and comfortable on the more modern, smaller aircraft.\nTake American airline JetBlue\u2019s new Mint Suites, designed to maximise privacy up front aboard a narrow-body aircraft, with business class seats designed as true cocoons, complete with large sliding privacy screens.\nBut of all the pandemic-influenced pivots, one of the most interesting is the increased focus on wellness, vegan and other plant-based meals \u2013 or opting for no meal at all.\nJapan Airlines\u2019 new healthy \u201cchew bowl\u201d is filled with immunity-boosting plant-based foods.\nQantas has rolled out a new plant-based menu across its international flights and in the lounges, including potato and celeriac gratin with fennel, peas, mushrooms and onion sauce; plus ratatouille pasta bake with herb crumb, cauliflower & green beans.\nIn July, Japan Airlines (JAL) unveiled its \u201cwellness kitchen\u201d joint-venture with Tanita, a concept cafe that links eating well to good mental health. It was started over a decade ago by Tanita, which makes weight and body fat scales. The company opened a restaurant in Tokyo\u2019s Marunouchi district to offer the same sort of healthy lunches already provided at its office cafeteria.\nJAL Tanita items include the \u201cchewing\u201d healthy salad bowl, accompanied by a leaflet with stretching exercises, and information on which foods best boost immunity.\nFibre-rich mochi wheat rice is also on the menu, along with salt-marinated chicken breast in vitamin-rich tomato sauce.\nJAL made a series of unwanted headlines in December 2020 when it encouraged passengers who did not intend to eat much, or even at all, to make that clear by opting for \u201cno meal(s)\u201d when they booked their ticket, leading to claims the airline was simply trying to cut costs and fleece customers. Rather, it was trying to reduce waste by not loading up unnecessary food and beverages, JAL argued.\nThe increased focus over the past two years on what and when we eat in the skies has certainly prompted some new thinking around whether you should still kick back and order the double souffle washed down with a gallon of fine Beaujolais when flying at the pointy end.\n\nRiffing off this theme, Japan<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "We've rounded up five of the best candles \u2014 sure to bring your room to life.\nIf you've ever found a perfume from the past or had an aromatherapy spa treatment, then you know that scent is a powerful thing; Which is why we consider candles to be an essential element of d\u00e9cor at home. They help set the mood and atmosphere of a space like not many things can.\nA delicious-smelling candle can do everything from put your mind at ease, to set the mood for a(nother) dinner at home, or help you celebrate the season.\nSmells such as lavender or vanilla create a safe and relaxing atmosphere, working wonders on the mind and spirit, while a citrusy scent may remind you of a favorite vacation, and a whiff of rose petals are reminiscent of days in the park with friends.\nOf course, when choosing the best candles, it all bubbles down to personal preference, but the upside to that is that some fail-safe fragrances are guaranteed to bring warmth and luxury into your rooms (and days) \u2013 and that's why we're here.\nWhether you're looking for a subtle, striking, or in-between scent, we've rounded up a shortlist of the best candles that are both suited for everyday use, or on the days you require a little self-care.\nIf you're looking for a universal scent in an iconic little jar, it's best to start with Diptyque's Vanille/Vanilla Candle as it is suitable for year-round use.\nWith a burn time of up to 60-hours, it justifies the $68 price tag, alongside its signature black-and-white decorative vessel. This candle will seamlessly double as your favorite home d\u00e8cor and has the versatility to be repurposed later on to hold makeup brushes or pencils on your desk.\nDense, black vanilla pods, so vividly fragrant that candle is more than enough to fill the air with its sweet-smelling scent. Layered with a spice that discloses a leathery, smoky accent, together, both are so blissfully beautiful when released, forging a captivating, powerful fragrance.\nFor those wondering how a Bath & Body Works candle made it on our must-have list, you've never smelt the Wildberry Jam Donut. It's the comfort and joy-induced candle that makes you feel so warm-and-toast inside, impossible to resist \u2014 and trust me, I've tried.\nWho are we kidding? We're all looking for ways to find comfort \u2013 and the sweet wildberry jam notes in this candle will get the job done. With top-notch concentrations of natural essential oils in its formula, alongside hints of powdered donuts and brown sugar crumble, this scent is reminiscent of childhood days baking cookies with loved ones or going into your favorite bakery shop on the weekends; it's the familiar scent that makes you feel at home (and at peace).\nThe three-wick candle is lead-free, soot-free, and offering a long-lasting, clean burn that's brighter for extra ambiance. With a burn-time of up to 45-hours, it's the sweet-smelling scent that you'll want to treat yourself to day-in-and-day-out.\nThis Village Candle Spice Pumpkin scent is like fall in a jar. Perfect for those chilly early autumn (and even late winter) day when you're cozying up at home.\nFor all you Pumpkin-Spice Latte-lovers out there: this candle is for you. Village Candle has blended warm cinnamon, rich vanilla, and tangy ginger with the freshest notes of pumpkin for an energizing and cozy homage to fall.\nWe love a high-quality fragrance, and when you factor in the food-grade paraffin wax for a clean, even burn, it's hard to pass up this perfect piece. The lead-free hand-trimmed cotton wick assures shoppers that we're not only investing in a worthwhile candle but will enjoy it with peace-of-mind as well. What's better than that? Nothing.\nA simple way to achieve balance and harmony in your home (or to mentally transport yourself to the spa) is through Chesapeake Bay's Reflection + Clarity Candle.\nAwaken your senses with this candle's diverse blend. Designed with a combination of eucalyptus, lavender, and sea salt with hints of sage blends perfectly here, emitting a light aroma and providing a sense of calm.\nSimilar to taking a relaxing bath, this candle has the same effect on our mind, body, and soul \u2014 but with a long-lasting affect. With a burn time of up to 50 hours and a formula that includes essentials oils, it's the one-stop-shop for restoring mindfulness.\nRounding out our list is by far one of the most long-lasting fragrances on the market, and that Yankee Candle's Coconut Beach Candle.\nTransport yourself to a tropical paradise courtesy of this candle. Designed with an intoxicating fragrance of wind-swept palms and coconut milk, it's the peace paradise we're all in desperate need of during this pandemic.\nThere are so many reasons to love this soy-blend candle, but let's state the obvious: the burn-time. Most options on the market have a candle-life expectancy of 40 to 50-hours when used, but not here.\nThis candle blows the rest out of the water with a burn-time of 110-to-150-hours. Exception! More so, since it's highly affordable. Ringing in at around $23 \u2014 contingent on what size jar you select \u2014 this super affordable jar is the vacation-in-a-bottle we all need ASAP.\nWhat to consider when selecting a candle?\nIt's crucial to estimate the place where you're looking to store your fragrance.\nFor the living area: it's best to consider your aesthetic or decor; minimalists will want to reach for woody scents, whereas traditional settings require a scent floral-based.\nWith kitchens: it's best to reach for something lighter and airier; the last thing you want to do is compete with food aromas, so we suggest a spicy scent or subtle aqua.\nNow, in the case, you're shopping for your bedroom: opt for an aroma that's lavender or vanilla-based; you'll want to calm your senses and create a peaceful oasis.\nWhat to look for in the best candle?\nThere a few considerations to take into account when selecting the best candle, such as the wax. Most recommend selecting a candle with 100% pure beeswax and no artificial colors.\nAnother important aspect is the wick type. Sure, most candles range from one-wick to three-wick, but whichever you do select (it's personal preference), it's best to find one that 100 percent cotton.\nLastly, when it comes to fragrance, there are two ways to go. Some recommend 100 percent pure essential oils due to their healing properties and natural-based formulas. While others say find a fragrance-free base, but truthfully, either way, works.\nNonetheless, with that said, it all boils down to personal preference and what you like. Take everything with a grain of salt, and go with your gut feeling to help you find your match.\nBath and Body Works 3 Wick...\nVillage Candle Spiced Pumpkin...\nChesapeake Bay Reflection +...\nYankee Candle Samplers...<|endoftext|>"

The dry-down is a soothing sage and evergreen woods.\nThe overall feel of this fragrance is soothing, grounding and meditative. It has the feel of isolation, like being in a vast forest.\nNotes listed include sandalwood, Virginian cedar, Himalayan cedar, vetiver, patchouli, buddhawood, and sage. Launch date 2012.\nGive Precious Woods a try if you love woodsy fragrances. Or if you like perfumes like Diptyque Tam Dao, Phaedon Grisens, CdG Wonderwood, and/or 10 Corso Como. Precious Woods is woodsy. I see it as unisex but it does lean more towards the masculine end of the spectrum.\nProjection and longevity is average.\nA 1 oz spray of \u20ac169 Precious Woods retails for at April Aromatics. The line does not have a U.S. retailer at this time but I have a hunch that will be changing very soon.\nVictoria\u2019s Final EauPINION \u2013 A quintessential woods fragrance. Lovers of straight forward woods scents will want to try this.\n*Disclaimer \u2013 Sample provided by April Aromatics. I am not financially compensated for this review. My opinions are my own. Product pic from April Aromatics. Washington rainforest pic is mine.\nI\u2019m so glad you reviewed this one, Victoria. I\u2019ve fallen for her fragrances in a big way (there are a couple don\u2019t that don\u2019t work for me, but I\u2019m very impressed with the majority of them, and head-over-heels in love with more than a few). They have a very saturated quality to them that really appeals to me\u2013including this one, which you described so well.\nI haven\u2019t made my way through them all but I\u2019ve been a fan of Bohemian Spice since it came out. I\u2019m rather enjoying her citrus-florals. I\u2019m surprised by their tenacity. Maybe I\u2019m digging the citrus-florals right now because the weather is crummy and I need something uplifting. I look forward to trying the rest but I\u2019ve been hung up on a few.\nIt\u2019s a lovely perfume. Thank you for sharing!\nYep, my review could be \u201cwoody\u201d and then call it a night!<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " \u201cmust go to\u201d stop in Paris is the Diptyque Boutique at 34 Boulevard Saint Germain (the original location)\u2026a short walking distance from where I stay on the Rue Jacob. Founded by three artistic friends in 1961, the company originally produced printed fabrics. In 1963 they introduced the scented candles (presently more than 50 scents in the collection) that have made the company so successful today. As of 2005, the company is now owned by a London based company, Manzanita Capital.\nWhat makes Diptyque so special and worthy of a hefty price point?\nAside from candles, Diptyque provides a vast array of personal fragrance products including perfume, soap, shower foam and oils, as well as hand and body lotion. Simple, classic packaging adds to its timeless luxury and quality.\nMy route to Diptyque.\nMeghan Markle in all her ethereal beauty.\nThose of you who were up early on the morning of May 19 (like me), to witness the marriage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, will remember this breathtaking image of an independent women walking down the aisle to her Prince. What we didn\u2019t know at the time was that the royal couple chose Diptyque to be the official scent of the wedding decor. Both parties burned candles while they were dressing for the ceremony and the fragrance inside St. George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor Castle was a combination of spring scented Diptyque candles and room sprays as well as a selection of white flowers (especially white roses which were Diana\u2019s favourite and peonies which are Meghan\u2019s favourite). Did you know that it\u2019s now a thing to have a personal decor scent for your wedding? I didn\u2019t. Maybe it\u2019s just for the Royals\u2026Princess Kate also had a personal favourite to scent Westminster Abbey on her wedding day.\nAlthough Diptyque will not (can not?) verify the exact scents that were used in St. George\u2019s Chapel, it\u2019s believed to be a combination of spring floral scents. Possibly the boxed set of roses, figuier, and baies?\nDiptyque candles fit beautifully into any decorating scheme. When Meghan Markle was writing her lifestyle blog (no longer available) she posted this picture. You will see a figuier candle in this carefully curated vignette\u2026as well as peonies.\nOnce your candle has burned down you can run your glass container through the dishwasher. I have done this numerous times and the label does not come off. The container can be repurposed for multiple uses and will fit into any room.\nMy favourite scent is Baies but 34 Boulevard Saint Germain is fast becoming a runner-up. 34 is said to emulate the heavenly scent of the original boutique in Paris (a combination of all scents).\nThankfully you don\u2019t have to fly to Paris everytime your supply of Diptyque runs low. In Canada, you will find either a Diptyque boutique or counter in Holt Renfrew stores. In Edmonton visit Larry Saccarello at the fragrance counter. He will be able to answer any questions you may have and/or get you started on the Diptyque obsession I have!<|endoftext|>"

From the products included inside (think, lipstick, perfume, eyeshadow and so much more), to the on-sale dates.\nWhen do beauty advent calendars go on sale in 2020?\nA couple of early bird brands will go on sale in September (so be sure to check this page in a couple of weeks time, to see which have gone live) but for the majority, on-sale dates tend to land in October.\nSo many makeup, skincare and haircare brands have gotten involved in the advent calendar action.

Bioblume.co.nz.\nThe transformative powers of scent are certainly nothing to sniff at, which is why we\u2019ll be sure to celebrate all things fragrant this year on World Fragrance Day on March 21. And where better to spend this sweet-smelling holiday than at Jo Malone London\u2019s Britomart boutique. It\u2019s here you\u2019ll discover everything there is to known about the British perfumer and its approach to fragrance combining. From fresh citrus through to warm woods, this sensorial experience will see you spritz your way to a bespoke scent that\u2019s uniquely yours. Visit Jo Malone London Britomart, Atrium on Takutai, Auckland.\nNow more than ever are we relying on at-home solutions to keep up appearances in between salon appointments. Which is why we\u2019re reaching for the new R+Co Bright Shadows Root Touch Up Spray, $41, to keep regrowth and greys at bay. Available in varying shades suited to blonde, brunette, black and red hair, this root touch-up spray is formulated with pearl extract, biotin, treated pigment, mica and tapioca starch to promote hair health while delivering multidimensional pigment to disguise greys and roots. Plus, the targeted nozzle ensures a mess-free application that lasts until your next shampoo. Stylehq.co.nz.\nThe newest innovation to join Emma Lewisham\u2019s 100 per cent natural Illuminating range is its new Brighten Your Day Creme, $107, an SPF-free day cream that serves double duty to hydrate and plump skin while stimulating collagen synthesis at a cellular level. As the name suggests, it helps to brighten the complexion using a blend of acerola and Kakadu plum, alongside a gentle blend of AHAs and BHAs.

Available from selected skin clinics, department stores and online from Emmalewisham.com.\nLuxury Parisian fragrance Maison celebrates its 60th anniversary this month, and is marking the occasion by releasing a coterie of limited-edition novelties, superseded only by the advent of its newest olfaction. Diptyque Orph\u00e9on 100ml eau de parfum, $271, takes its moniker from a late-night bar adjoining the original Diptyque boutique, situated in Paris\u2019 Saint-Germain quarter. The new Orph\u00e9on eau de parfum acts as an olfactory expression of this memorable location, with a composition that highlights the scent of burnished wood on the bar counter and tables, curls of tobacco smoke, the aroma of gin and tonic, and the trailing perfumes of the people who frequented the bar. Available exclusively from March 15 from Mecca or online from Meccabeauty.co.nz.\nYou\u2019ve heard of eye cream, but what about expression cream? La Mer takes a two-fold approach to tackling the visible signs of ageing with its Genaissance De La Mer Eye and Expression Cream, $690, which is designed to lift, firm and plump areas of the face that show signs of expression (forehead and smile lines), while addressing signs of fatigue, puffiness, dark circles and fine lines under eyes. Highly concentrated natural ingredients combine to restore hydration and softness to skin, while rare red algae and 24 karat gold help stimulate collagen production. For best results, apply twice daily using the sea stone-inspired massage tool included, which helps to boost circulation, cool and soothe skin while applying product to the face. Available from Mecca or online from Meccabeauty.co.nz.\n\u2026is the modus operandi behind Beyond\u2019s range of package-free natural soap bars. The local soap makers grew tired of single-use liquid soap bottles and plastic-lined packaging, so thought to interrupt the market with their own line of all-natural, plant-based soaps that leave nasty petrochemicals, unethical palm oil and animal derivatives at the door. Each set of 80g Beyond soap bars, $37, come housed in a compostable cardboard box with compostable paper wrap, and are conveniently delivered to your door. For the month of March, Beyond Soap will donate one bar of Beyond soap to the Auckland City Mission\u2019s emergency food parcels with every purchase, in addition to the 158 bars they\u2019ve already donated. Beyondsoap.co.nz.\nIf you\u2019ve ever been hit with a pang of guilt after swiping on toner with a single-use cotton pad, then consider switching to a reusable option that can be washed and used time and time again. The new Garnier Micellar Reusable Eco Pads 3pk, $17, are reusable and washable up to 1000 times per pad \u2014 meaning in each pack you\u2019ll get 3000 uses out of just one pack.

The certification was awarded by the Cruelty Free International Leaping Bunny programme, an organisation which aims to end animal testing across the board. Available exclusively from Farmers department stores or online from Farmers.co.nz.\nIt\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s been two years since Sephora opened the doors to its first flagship store in Auckland\u2019s Queen St, and now the global beauty giant is set to unveil its second door inside Sylvia Park on March 18. Beauty aficionados will delight over the multi-level mega store, which includes the launch of Pat McGrath Labs into the beauty giant\u2019s coterie of exclusive makeup, skincare, haircare and body-care brands.

        "passage": "It was very exciting to receive my new unit from the PerfumersWorld \u2013 it was all about flowers \u2013 about 18 sample formulae to make, investigate and to play with, so I can learn to understand the soul of each of floral note in perfumery. The funniest thing I discovered that there are flowers I don\u2019t know at all\u2026 like freesia.\nWell, of course I\u2019ve heard about it and met in pyramids, but\u2026 I\u2019ve found I don\u2019t remember how it looks like or how does it smell. That\u2019s a good time to learn about this fragrance. And you know, Fortune always helps to those who follows their heart and is eager to discover. May be that\u2019s why the next day I found folder from the local garden shop telling me they had fragrant Freesias on sale, so I went there to meet my housework and came home with two freesias \u2013 a white one and pink with yellow.\nThe first surprise was to discover that they smell different. The white flower has a fresh fragrance with peppery notes and the colored one smells very green \u2013 just like at florist shop \u2013 a mixed fragrance of plants, leaves and stems. It\u2019s fresh and rather soft green unlike the sharp smell of fresh grass or crushed leaves. It\u2019s funny to find how many varieties of flowers in shapes and colors it produces\u2026 and the tough thing is that the smell varies as well. So, what would be the reference?\nPerfumersWorld in their course puts Freesia among \u201cLight Green Floras\u201d together with Muguet and Cyclamen. I also found that in one classification it was listed under the Tuberose-Narcissus group. Well to my nose it\u2019s green, but less sharp than hyacinth and less poisonous than narcissus. I guess \u201clight green\u201d or \u201cfresh green\u201d would be the nice place for Freesia.\nIt\u2019s funny to find that there is very little information on Freesia in perfumery books or magazines. Well, I can understand that \u2013 there is no essential oil or absolute available. Some sources mention that Freesia have been a fantasy bouquet in earlier fragrances. They also mention that it was used for extracts or as modifier.\nSearching for Freesia fragrances I found that most of the soliflores called Freesia are made by brands specializing on Bodycare fragrances (like Crabtree&Evelyn, The Body Shop, Bath&Body Works) \u2013 I guess the freshness of Freesia note makes it very suitable for such products. But I also found a couple of niche Freesia fragrances \u2013 \u201cOrf\u00e9sia\u201d van Diptyque and \u201cMusc et Freesia\u201d by E.Coudray. Fragonard, Borsari and Demeter also have their Freesia versions. Unfortunately I haven\u2019t smell any of them, so it promises a lot of sniffing, discovery and surprises.\nBrowsing through the Basenotes discussions I also found the following fragrances might be interesting to try: Miracle by Lancome, Red Door by Elizabeth Arden, Rush by Gucci, Cerruti 1881 pour femme, Eternity by Calvin Klein, Kenzo Parfum d\u2019Ete, So de la Renta, Beige van Chanel, Paul Smith Woman, Sun Moon Stars van Lagerfeld, New York Fling by Bond No. 9, Antonia\u2019s Flowers, Pleasures by Estee Lauder, Allure by Chanel, L\u2019Eau d\u2019Issey by Issey Miyake, JPG Classique, Dolce & Gabbana Woman, Ralph by Ralph Lauren, Incanto Dreams by Salvatore Ferragamo, Balmy Days and Sundays by<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " I want to talk about Wowder, Glossier's finishing and setting powder.\nAlthough Wowder came out some time ago now, I thought it might be interesting to revisit an older release because you end up discovering what's stood the test of time that way, which I don't think this has. I feel like no one's really talked about this product since it first came out and there are a few reasons why I think that is. Firstly, the packaging; the 'Wowder' name and logo are very Benefit-esque and seems a little off-brand with the rest of the line. Plus, I've heard the trampoline mesh is quite messy to work with (loose powders are way too much of a hassle for me and I'd rather stick with pressed), which again, isn't very fitting with Glossier's whole effortless and fuss-free vibe. Secondly, and my main gripe I have with Wowder; the abysmal three-shade colour range. Glossier state on their website that \"no skin tone is HD-white\", but no skin tone is just \"Light/Medium\", \"Dark/Deep\" and \"Rich\" either! For someone who's skin colouring is somewhere in the middle and who's never had trouble with bases, I know for a fact that Light/Medium is way too light for me and that Dark/Deep is way too dark, and although Glossier claim they're sheer, there have been complaints about the shade range and I really don't think powder formulas are as adaptable as liquids. I know Tarte were recently and deservedly criticised (some even going as far as to completely boycott the brand) for the white-washed shade range of their Shape Tape Foundation and in 2018, brands need to do better.\nWarm-toned eyeshadows are all the rage at the moment and for the most part, I've really enjoyed this trend in makeup as it's opened me up to colours I didn't think suited my skin tone that are now actually some of my favourites. As my complexion is quite neutral, I don't like to lean overly warm (or cool, for that matter) with my makeup and as hyped up as the Urban Decay Naked Heat Eyeshadow Palette has been, this definitely wasn't for me. I get why people like it and in fact, I think it's the most groundbreaking thing Urban Decay have done with their Naked line in a long, long time, however, I do have my qualms with their Naked Petite Heat Palette. From looking at swatches online, I really don't see a discernible difference between the shades in the two palettes and as the people most interested in it are already likely to own the regular size, there's really no point in also owning the petite version.\nAt least when Urban Decay released their Naked Basics line some few years ago, they gave us something to complement their predominantly all-shimmer palettes, but I don't think any warm eyeshadow fan needs both Naked Heat palettes given how similar they are. I kind of feel like Urban Decay are beginning to milk their Naked range dry now and there's only so much more you can do with neutral eyeshadows! I think what attracts people to the Naked Petite Heat Palette is its size more so than anything else; it's cute, a fun play on the original and travel-friendly, but red and orange eyeshadow lovers probably have these shades elsewhere in their collection and even though I was never going to buy this palette myself, I don't think you should either.\nWhen it comes to eyeshadow, I'm much more partial to shimmer and sparkle than an all-matte look and the whole dreamy and ethereal vibe of a glittery eye is something that I absolutely adore. When the Stila Magnificent Metals Glitter & Glow Liquid Eye Shadows were first released, however, I wasn't all that fussed by them (no particular reason, they just didn't grab my attention the way other glittery eyeshadows have) and swatching them in-store only confirmed this. First of all, I'm indifferent to the shade range; I don't hate it, but it most certainly doesn't excite me and I don't feel like there are any colours that I'd want to wear over and over again. Secondly, I find the glitter particles way too chunky for my liking and the silver sparkle also comes across as a little too harsh and overpowering. As much as I love my glitter, I prefer it in a more subtle and soft-focused form like the Urban Decay Moondust Eyeshadows or in something like an eyeshadow topper as opposed to an intensely pigmented liquid. My dream glittery eyeshadow is the Tom Ford Cream and Powder Eye Colour in Young Adonis and although it's almost three times the cost of Stila's, it is honestly one of the most beautiful things I've ever come across. I'll most likely end up splurging on this for my birthday later in the year!\nWhen I think of Chanel, I think of words such as \"style\", \"elegance\" and \"sophistication\", but their latest release, the Poudre \u00c0 L\u00e8vres Lip Balm and Powder Duo, is unfortunately, none of those things to me. Dubbed a \"deconstructed lipstick\", it's made up of a moisturising lip balm and a powder pigment that you're supposed to layer on top with either your fingertips or a brush, but in all seriousness, who on bloody earth has time for that? Perhaps I'm just super low maintenance when it comes to lip products, but to me, a regular lipstick is enough of a faff as it is, let alone having to worry about a powder that's probably more difficult to achieve an even finish with, as well as needing some sort of applicator. I can imagine touching up when you're on the go being a nuisance with this too and there are plenty of other lip powders now on the market (it originated in Korea) that can achieve the same look for a lot less hassle. Don't get me wrong, I totally get why people are intrigued by it; it's something different and you could dress anything up in Chanel's sleek black packaging and it would be beautiful. However, if this were Maybelline or even Benefit (is it obvious I'm not a fan?!), you'd probably be telling another story! To me, there's a difference between innovative and gimmicky, and although I dearly love Chanel, this definitely falls into the latter.\nWhen Mecca first announced that they'd be stocking Maison Margiela 'Replica' fragrances a few months ago, I couldn't have been more excited. Beauty brands are always all the more alluring when they've been inaccessible and given how popular they are with international bloggers, I was keen to find out what all fuss was about. Not too long ago, however, I popped into Mecca Maxima to give them a sniff and I have to say, I was deeply disappointed by the scent range. I'm all for niche fragrances and I absolutely adore brands such as Diptyque, Jo Malone and Byredo, but there was nothing about the Replica perfumes that appealed to me in the slightest. By the Fireplace is probably the nicest smelling one, but even then, I definitely don't like it enough to want to own it.\nI realise that everyone has different taste in fragrance and while a little bit of a let down that I was underwhelmed by something so raved about, my real issue with the Replica fragrances is the labelling. Under \"Style Description\" on the front label of the bottles, Maison Margiela use the terms \"Female fragrance\", \"Male fragrance\" and \"Female and Male fragrance\" to describe their scents, which is completely ignorant and exclusionary to the LGBTIQA community who may not identify with those terms. Not everyone is simply \"female\" or \"male\" and \"feminine\" or \"masculine\", and in 2018, why can't people just wear what they want to wear without the archaic classification? Not to mention, \"female\" and \"male\" can literally mean anything. Are we talking about a female cat? A male dog?! Obviously, this is part of a much larger issue and isn't specific Maison Margiela or the beauty industry; gendered labelling exists in fashion and everywhere else too. To actually outwardly label their bottles takes it to a whole other level though and although I'm a cishet woman who's traditionally feminine, this doesn't sit right with me. I feel like even if I did like their fragrances, the labelling alone is enough to completely put me off the brand and isn't something I feel comfortable having in my collection.\nIf I had to choose my favourite fragrance brand, it'd 100% be Diptyque. From their perfumes to their candles, to the absolutely stunning packaging, there isn't a thing I don't love... except for one: the Eau Rose Hair Mist. Considering the Eau Rose EDT is my signature scent, you'd think I'd be all over this, but hair perfume, to me, is a gimmick and a little bit ridiculous. As Jess of Little Henry Lee mentioned in her Beauty Anti-Haul post, unless you're using a similar scented perfume on your body, your hair perfume would clash, and if your hair really needed its own fragrance, then it was probably just about time you gave it a wash! A spritz of dry shampoo or heat protectant that you already own and use does the same job<|endoftext|>"

I loved reading your reviews for these \u2014 I felt much the same way about this collection, save for Sikkim Girls (which reads a lot less floral and a lot more incense on my skin than yours, I think). Volume 2 was an interesting endeavour, but\u2026 I don\u2019t know. It just didn\u2019t really resonate with me, I guess!\nRae // theNotice recently posted..28/09/13 Link Love: Osmia Organics, cruelty-free beauty, & nail art (lots and lots of nail art).\nI actually didn\u2019t wear Sikkim Girls on skin because well, no samples! I have a feeling that it\u2019s different on skin than on paper (all perfumes are). I ended up wearing on skin Hellstone, Voice of Reason, The Bug and Devil\u2019s Nightcap (all the space I had).\nI really hate the bottles with these. The dropper is weird. I want them to go back to the black bottles!\nHi Victoria, I just want to say that I like your blog and appreciate that you\u2019re taking the time to write all those reviews! As for Lush: Maybe Flowers Barrow is worth sniffing again. I thought it was a more herbal/masculine version of Diptyque l\u2019Ombre dans l\u2019Eau. Quite wearable. After reading your mini review I want to check Hellstone again, because I don\u2019t remember that one. I had The Bug for a while (great concept & poster indeed!) but the dry down didn\u2019t feel right on me. What do you think about its dry down?\nThe problem that I had with this review is that I didn\u2019t wear all of them on the skin and I don\u2019t have samples. I had to go to the store apply, take notes. Saying that, I didn\u2019t try Flower\u2019s Barrow on skin (or Sikkim Girls). So, I only got the top notes and what they dried down to on paper. And that\u2019s not a fair assessment of the perfumes, I admit that.\nI will try Flower\u2019s Barrow again (since now the store is carrying them permanently even though they said they wouldn\u2019t, wth?). I\u2019m all about rose so technically I should love it (still a fan of Imogen Rose).\nI agree with you about The Bug. It\u2019s good but it does go weird on me when it dries down\u2026like stale or something.\nA pal gave me their bottle of Hellstone as they didn\u2019t like it. I think it\u2019s worth retrying. They launched so many at once that it is very easy to overlook ones that you may like (I have a feeling I have).<|endoftext|>"

With such a strong importance, would you want the scent that you pick to be common or distinct? It is this mission for a distinctive soul fragrance that is resulting in a visible spike in the appeal of specific niche fragrances that have unique cost points, artisanal approach (little batches, exceptional quality and unusual natural active ingredients, and higher concentration of perfume extracts), and limited points of sale.\nEstablished in 2000 by expert fragrance evaluator and critic Frederic Malle, this perfume house is an outcome of generations of perfumery knowledge. Malle's grandfather developed Parfums Christian Dior for the style brand with the launch of the classic Miss Dior. Malle does not produce fragrances himself; instead, he functions as an editor working together with world-renowned perfumers to craft artisanal scents without being limited by a particular brand name design.\nHere Are 3 Of The Most Expensive Perfumes In The World...\nPortrait of a Lady, Lipstick Rose, Carnal Flower The name behind this extreme brand is Italian perfumer Alessandro Gualtieri, who has produced fragrances for Versace, Valentino, Helmut Lang, Fendi, Diesel, and more. Gualtieri established his Amsterdam-based brand name in 2007 and called it Nasomatto (Italian for 'insane nose'). The notes are shrouded in secrecy with none shared except eccentric descriptions such as'stimulate degrees of hysteria' or 'enhance all the symptoms of male strength'.\nSold in a Baccarat crystal container, with a 5-carat white diamond on its 18-karat gold collar, each bottle was sold reportedly for US$ 215,000 making the per-ml rate US$ 430. The brand's predecessor, the Crown Perfumery Business developed in 1872, is the only home to utilize Queen Victoria's crown on its bottles.\nThis store fine fragrance business (literally implying 'The Laboratory' in French), founded in 2005 in New york city, is best known for its irreverent aromas (wholesale cologne). The name of each fragrance is composed of its most prominent note, and the number next to it is the number of overall notes it includes.\nNot to miss the minimalist almost-apothecary-like bottles. High up on sustainability, this eco-friendly, cruelty-free and vegan brand has a refill programme where customers can bring in their empty bottles for a refill.: Rose 31, Santal 33, Oud 27 Interior designer Christiane Gautrot, painters Desmond Knox-Leet and Yves Coueslant, a theater director, and set designer, opened Diptyque at 34 Boulevard Saint-Germain mainly to display their own prints and home furnishings.\nThe blends utilize extremely high quality, uncommon and valuable raw ingredients.: Tam Dao, Volutes, Philosykos Each composition is imbued with voluptuousness of oudh embedded in earthy notes of flowers, roots, and herbs.

I bought this perfume at Christmas as part of a set if 5 miniature perfumes. I had not tried any perfumes by this brand and thought it was a good way to try new scents. This was my absolute favourite from the five. It is a soft floral scent that lingers most of the day. It is not too sweet as some floral perfumes can be.

        "passage": "Sales of bold scents inspired by far-off destinations led to a fragrance boom during the pandemic and the return of travel hasn\u2019t slowed momentum.\nPerfume, popular during the pandemic because it allowed for \u201carmchair travel,\u201d is seeing continued demand as people return to planning trips and vacations.\nRetailers are seeing customers gravitate towards stronger perfumes with higher concentrations of fragrance oil.\nFragrance sales in the US increased by nearly 50 percent in 2021, experiencing more growth than any other prestige beauty category in the US last year.\nOver the past two years, consumers looked to strong-scented perfume to transport them to another place and time, somewhere far from real life.\nIn the last year, Byredo, known for clean, minimalist scents like its longtime bestseller Gypsy Water, saw success with new, bold fragrances, like Mumbai Noise, an intense eau de parfum that embodied the hustle and bustle of India\u2019s largest city.\nD.S. & Durga\u2019s second best-selling fragrance in 2021 was Jazmin Yucatan, which invokes the jungle \u2014 humidity, snake plants, limestone ruins, crocodiles by the cenote and all. David Moltz, the brand\u2019s co-founder and perfumer, described the perfume as \u201cpowdery,\u201d \u201csexy,\u201d \u201cfrosty\u201d and \u201cambery,\u201d noting that it\u2019s stronger than longtime bestsellers, \u201cI Don\u2019t Know What,\u201d a \u201ctransparent\u201d scent that \u201cpeople can\u2019t put their finger on,\u201d and \u201cDebaser,\u201d a soft, fig fragrance.\nThere\u2019s a reason D.S. & Durga\u2019s tagline is \u201cperfume is armchair travel.\u201d Everyone needs an escape, and when it comes to beauty, scent is the quickest, most powerful vehicle to do so. Fragrance\u2019s deep ties to memory make it more personal and emotional than other beauty purchases. During the pandemic, people used scent to distract from heavy headlines and day-to-day minutiae, opting for stronger perfume and candles with ties to specific destinations.\nFragrance sales in the US increased by nearly 50 percent last year, experiencing more growth than any other prestige beauty category in the US in 2021, according to the NPD Group. Sales of luxury lines from designer fragrance brands nearly doubled in size, and higher-end, artisanal fragrances, which are usually bolder and often contain higher concentrations of fragrance oil than traditional scents, grew by 68 percent.\nSo where did people travel to on their theoretical fragrance trips? Besides India or the Yucatan Peninsula, thanks to Byredo\u2019s Mumbai Noise or D.S. & Durga\u2019s Jazmin Yucatan, some went to the Mediterranean, courtesy of Aerin Lauder\u2019s Mediterranean Honeysuckle, Levy said. Others went to beaches in Mexico with House of Bo\u2019s Agua de Santos or to the French Riviera with Cartier\u2019s Les Rivi\u00e8res de Cartier collection. For Diptyque\u2019s 60th anniversary last year, the brand released limited-edition Paris, Venice, Milies, Kyoto and Byblos scents and candles.\nBecause of store closures at the onset of the pandemic and limited availability of testers upon reopening, fragrance brands had to operate on a \u201clevel playing field,\u201d said Levy. No brand had the try before you buy advantage; everyone had to rely on the same online storytelling and ingredient marketing.\nByredo\u2019s De Los Santos, for example, was released in March and billed as an \u201caromatic cloud of musk\u201d with \u201cthe splendour of amber and incense.\u201d Gorham said De Los Santos tells a story of loss, death and celebration of life, inspired by the passing of his father and a close friend.\n\u201cIt ultimately results in a fragrance or a perfume but it\u2019s just about capturing a story, and sometimes it\u2019s nondescript, simple, and muted and other times it\u2019s highly expressive like Mumbai Noise,\u201d Gorham said.\nBrands experimented with different ways to convey those stories to consumers. With D.S. & Durga\u2019s Jazmin Yucatan, the brand livened up its minimalist packaging with Jazmin Yucatan; a vivid jungle motif of lush grasses, plants and a blue-eyed toucan are printed on labels and boxes. The perfume performed so well for the brand that it was added to its permanent lineup last year after its initial release as a limited-edition collaboration with Opening Ceremony in spring 2020.\nD.S. & Durga\u2019s limited-edition fragrance, Pistachio, sold out within two hours of launching on the line\u2019s website in February.\nWhat\u2019s different is the psychology driving purchases. Like makeup, wearing a bolder perfume connotes a return to celebrations, parties and other events that were put on hold for much of 2020 and 2021.\nDr Rachel Herz, a neuroscientist and expert on the psychological science of smell, said two factors fuel the current desire for louder, splashier scents: increased exposure to fragrance in the home for two years and customers who just want something different as they enter a new phase of life.\n\u201cWe want to demarcate that with fragrances that are creating a sensory and emotional shift,\u201d Herz explained.\nExperts think those who shifted away from \u201cwearable\u201d and approachable scents to stronger fragrances that allowed them to \u201cvisit\u201d places they were unable to at the time or served as an outlet to experiment with different notes or intensities will continue to do so.\nNew fragrance terminology at the store and brand level is helping with that.\n\u201c<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Because this is the day when the massive linden trees are in full-bloom splendour in the lane behind our house, the honeysuckle is wafting from the neighbour\u2019s fence, last night\u2019s rain is misting upward as the morning sun heats up, and wouldn\u2019t you know it, the big mowers are out cutting the grass in the local park. Can you smell it? Nothing compares to this!\nThe #1 for me is the linden \u2013 called lime blossom, tilleul, basswood in other parts of the world. Used as medicine, drunk as tea, it's also been a romantic symbol for centuries, because of its thick shade canopy, and the powerful scent of its small white flowers. I love linden blossoms \u2013 they\u2019re even better than May lilacs in my smell book. They smell green, fresh, sweet, grassy \u2013 in one big sniff I get all that - and I\u2019ve tried to find a fragrance that captures this magic of the linden note for me.\nIt\u2019s been a real hunt. Soaps I\u2019ve found \u2013 the linden note itself has a soapy quality \u2013 and L\u2019Occitane had a beautiful big Linden bath soap but it\u2019s now (sadly) discontinued. Soap scents don\u2019t stay on my skin, anyway. I want a perfume!\nI\u2019ve tried and tried and tried very hard to like L\u2019Artisan\u2019s La Chasse aux Papillons \u2013 the jasmine and tuberose overpower the green linden and make it too sweet, too girly for my taste. Too soft, too fey. And it lasts about 5 seconds on my skin \u2013 I\u2019d get a sore arm from re-spritzing!\nL\u2019Artisan makes a candle called Tilleul au Vent (Linden in the Wind) which I\u2019ve smelled and it is totally exquisite. But how do you wear a candle scent? Guess I could rub the wax on my arms....no, not a good idea.\nI\u2019ve tried Jo Malone's French Lime Blossom \u2013 linden, with lily of the valley, bergamot and tarragon. It\u2019s pretty nice, but to my nose it turned one-dimensional after thirty minutes on my skin. It smells like linden, no doubt about it, but it\u2019s missing the lush complexity of a big tree in bloom, and smells overly sweet, more like drooping blossoms stuck in a vase. Too bad.\nOne of the older Diptyque scents is a linden, called Tilleul. It\u2019s hard to find \u2013 discontinued? I haven\u2019t smelled it, and probably never will.\nParfums D\u2019Orsay has their Tilluel. First introduced in 1927, and again in 1955, the new 21st century version is by Olivia Giacobetti \u2013 need I say more? It features notes of lemon tree leaf, angelica, watermelon, lime blossom (linden or tilleul), cyclamen, cut hay, acacia wood and beeswax. Regarded as a delicate fragrance, it\u2019s said to have a musty note in the dry-down, most likely from the hay and the beeswax. It sounds more complex, but \u2013 I haven\u2019t sniffed this one either. I can\u2019t find it anywhere.\nI\u2019ve just learned that the L\u2019Artisan candle Tilleul au Vent is also available as a room freshener, and a store nearby says they have it in stock. I\u2019m going to stop in and try it. I\u2019ve never worn a room freshener before, but maybe I\u2019ll start. I really want a linden perfume!\nFailing that, I\u2019ll get a lawn chair and sit in the lane under the lindens so I can smell the trees, the real perfume, the real deal, and I'll be happy. I think some scents just can't be put in<|endoftext|>"

Birthdays: Diane von F\u00fcrstenberg and Anthony Hopkins. What fragrance are you wearing?\nI'm in Diptyque Tam Dao layered with Diptyque Philosykos.\nReminder: on 1/4, wear a fragrance to match Living Coral, Pantone's color of the year for 2019 (see below).\nNote: top image is ALamentationOfSwans_BreisachGermany (30) [cropped] by Regan Vercruysse at flickr; some rights reserved.\nA big bottle of Philosykos was one of my purchases this year. I regret I waited so long to experience it. It is lovely and not like anything else I own.\nI\u2019ve been telling myself that a bottle of this is a MUST for me in 2019. It will likely be the only one, but it will be so gratifying on its own. Good for you!\nOh yes, it\u2019s wonderful. I am so happy I have a bottle!\nRobin, you\u2019re Double Diptyque-ing!\nI am ending 2018 finishing a full bottle of Gucci Guilty, THUNK!\nTonight, I will spend it with my family quietly at home. I will be wearing my beloved and #1 favorite iris Chanel 28 La Pausa EdT. Enjoy the day, enjoy the night. Whatever you do be in peace and be happy. Hugs!\nHappy New Year, pl67!!!!\nI will add some Cuir de Russie to my neck tonight so we will be house twins! But I may be crashing before 7pm LOL!\nHappy New Year CM8! I wish I could be in bed by 7pm, but we will stay up until midnight. At least I will be waking up late tomorrow!\nHappy New Year! What iris is 28 La Pausa closest to?\nHappy New Year Lillyjo. I cannot compare La Pausa to any other iris perfume. I wish I could find something very close to it.\nHappy New Year to you too Madtowngirl. A quiet evening is the best. We will have dinner together and then be watch tv until 12am. I am glad the holidays are over!\n28 La Pausa is a great scent to farewell 2018 and welcome 2019.\nOoh, you will smell fabulous. Happy New Year!\nthere\u2019s nothing more satisfying imo than emptying products! especially perfume as it\u2019s so rare I actually get all the way through one. Congrats!\nI agree! It is much easier to finish body lotions, soaps, make up, etc. I guess the amount of perfumes we have and how little we spend on each bottle prevent us from reducing our collection. Nothing more satisfying than finishing a full bottle. Decants and samples go faster!\nEnding the year on a thunk, yay! Happy new year!\nIt couldn\u2019t be better! \ud83d\ude00. Happy New Year Cazaubon!\nHola from Barcelona! It\u2019s a lovely city, filled with bars, cafes, and shops. I am on the lookout for a perfume shop called Les Tropettes, but haven\u2019t come across it yet in my perambulations. \nHappy New Year, everybody. Let\u2019s make this a better one than the last. Safe travels on this eve, and buena suerte in the upcoming year.\n\u00a1Hola! One day, maybe I will get to visit Barcelona!\nBarcelona is the lovely Mr. Spicebomb\u2019s favorite city! He keeps trying to talk me into expatriating there.\nHola Lisa D! Happy New Year!\nThe Boqueria Market is great. Enjoy your stay!\nThrilled you\u2019re enjoying Barcelona! I love la Boqueria (but yes, it\u2019s a bit much!). Is there any sign of the recent Catalonian unrest? I\u2019ve been wondering if going to Barcelona is ok right now.\nEnjoy Barcelona! Happy New Year!\nHappy New Year! Good luck finding the perfume shop.\nBarcelona sounds fantastic! Enjoy starting the new year there!\nEnjoy Barcelona, one of my favorite cities! The Perfumery is lovely if you haven\u2019t visited it yet, and so are Perfumeria Regia\u2019s flagship store and La Bas\u00edlica Galleria.\nQuestion for everyone: how many bottles did you finish this year?\nMe: zero! I didn\u2019t even finish many decanted! But I hate to finish things and live to save them. I hardly ever even finish samples!\nFinished one \u2013 of Atelier Cologne Silver Iris.\nI\u2019m a zero too.\na lot\u2026between making decants for family and friends and just spraying lavishly- a lot\u2026.my guess maybe 10? or more?\nWow! What did you finish? What do you wear the most often?\nOud Al Sahraa, Arz El Rab, Stash, leau de Kasaneka, Sublime, Falling in Love, Soleil de Capris, Ginger Musk, Tendre, eau de Campagne, Black Flower Mexican Vanilla\u2026 I am sure more that I just can\u2019t remember\u2026. and I have finished a large amount of samples and decants as well.\nAnd Nu, Philosykos and my 200 ml bottle of Orange Sanguine.\nAnd Reglisse Noire which I wore for three and a half weeks straight\u2026. I have approximately 1 ml left in the bottle so I consider it done.\nFresh Cream Warm Cashmere: It\u2019s super light so that was easy to finish.\nFleur de Oranger (Prada) This was a mini from a Prada Mini set.\nAromatics: This was a mini that a bought a few years ago. Potent stuff so it took a while to use up.\nI *just* bought my first bottle of Rose Jam shower gel. I am aware that I\u2019m am about 3 years behind the times (which, honestly, seems pretty good for me)!\nHa! But honestly that is good, since Rose Jam is now a permanent addition to the shower gel collection available in stores and online!\nI\u2019ve been having fun matching/pairing my post-bath scents to it. Any recommendations?\n1000 Flowers Rose Cassis Paradis is a perfect match for Rose Jam.\nIt goes very well with woods and incense!\nHowever, when I was cleaning up in preparation for selling my house, I found perhaps half a dozen empty bottles (which suggests I occasionally finish them, I suppose). I couldn\u2019t convince myself to throw them out, so at some point I will likely offer them up for freebies to folks who like such things.\nJust one actual bottle. Stella.\nI believe just one, Prada Candy, early in the year. I saved the bottle, but finally threw it out the other day.\nIt\u2019s really hard for me to throw away pretty empty bottles and boxes, even though I never use them!\n1: Atelier Bois Blonds. I would like to finish more this year, and also focus on wearing scents I really love. Life is too short.\nI love Bois Blonds and Trefle Pur.\nOnly one that I can think of\u2014Jo Malone Orange Blossom, a souvenir from our trip to Seattle four years ago. I also hate to finish a bottle unless I have a replacement all ready to go. The thought of never smelling a particular perfume again makes me sad, so I tend to hoard the last few mls. I consider a bottle \u201cfinished\u201d if it is down to ~10% or less of its original volume.\nZero bottles, many samples! (Dozens.) A large number of 5-mL decants (maybe ten or so). I\u2019ve been making an active effort to finish samples and decants that I think might go bad or evaporate away.\nWhich decants did you finish?\nI probably should\u2019ve recorded this, huh? Let\u2019s see\u2013Dame Verbena, Freesia, & Musk; Dame Dark Horse; SSS Tabac Aurea (but only after I was able to purchase a travel spray!); By Kilian Straight from Heaven; Tauer LADDM; Tauer Incense Ros\u00e9; MFK Grand Soir; TF Santal Blush; and some others I can\u2019t recall.\nI am not keeping a record, but I finished several bottles, decants and samples and I will continue doing that next year.\nAbout 16 or 17 samples, and 3 full bottles (although, full disclosure, none of the FBs were actually full when I started.) I\u2019m hoping to do 12 samples and one FB this year.\nNone! I used up lots of<|endoftext|>"

Obviously these two fragrances hold a special place in your heart and scent memory!\nI wasn't worried about it, but was a bit surprised I've never stumbled onto anything. Especially since I've made a ton of Lucky Scent purchases wherein they send me samples of stuff I didn't request.\nSure, perhaps also it might be more difficult to find something randomly in niche vs. designer? As an example, if you had received a bunch of TdH, BdC, [insert more mass appealing scent here] (and somehow had never smelled them before) you might be more likely to find something?\nJPG Le Male Le Parfum.\nI was hesitant to even take a free sample vial when I purchased a fragrance at a local store as I don\u2019t like many of the Le Male flankers. Le Parfum is really nice on my skin and I ended up buying a 200ml bottle.\nI was once in a department store trying out fragrances, and was lamenting to the sales associate that original Dior Homme had been discontinued, and when I purchased a Tom Ford bottle, he told me he'd throw one of their old Dior Homme testers in my bag. When I got to the car and opened it up, it was instead Dior Homme Eau. I was initially bummed, but it turned out to be a wonderful fragrance.\nMad Anthony from Happyland Studio Fragrances; it's the one E.J. Wells, proprietor and perfumer, tossed in when I ordered the other three samples, and I am SO HAPPY he did; might be my favorite of the four.\nLast July I ordered an exclusive release of Ormonde Jayne's Gold Elixir. What arrived was a Travel Set (five 10ml sprays), which was also an exclusive, both available only at Selfridges. I offered to return the set, but was told to keep it, and a bottle of Gold Elixir was immediately dispatched. VERY generous! Contained within the Travel Set is a perfume called Persica. It was not yet released at the time, and then only as a limited full-bottle release in August, and I immediately purchased two. So this is how Persica \"fell into my lap\", dropped me to my knees (figuratively) and is the first perfume in my entire 20+ years of exploration that I have ever, ever considered a \"Signature\" fragrance for myself.\nTHIS BOTTLE was given to me as a gift a few years...uhhh...ahem decades ago. I love the stuff even more today!\nA very special Aunt gifted me a bottle of Chanel No. 19 EDT on my 19th birthday. Had never laid nostrils on it before, and I was immediately smitten; I adore it to this day. I always smile and scratch my head when people describe it as a cold, mature scent\u2014it always reminds me of those heady days and nights of newfound adulthood, independence and f-u-n.\nWay back at the start of my niche fragrance journey I found Les Senteurs in the UK and back then, although they had a website (or I might have even ordered their paper catalogue), certain products could only be sold in person or over the phone. The fragrances in question were 3 Creed Samples. Like many my age, Creed was my introduction to niche fragrance. If I recall correctly this would have been around 2-3 years after Himalaya had been released so Creed were still quite exclusive (and MUCH cheaper, but still expensive) back then.\nAnyway, I spoke to the SA on the phone, ordered my samples and we had a chat about my interest in fragrances and I explained I was only just branching into niche. The SA said that they'd put a few more samples in for me for free.\nWhat turned up was a padded envelope packed with samples, like, at least 20.\n2 that stood out for me were Knize Ten and LDDM.\nI have some other anecdotes too but they are related to purchases, not just something falling in my lap.\nThis is what dreams are made of! Yes! Thank you for sharing!\nTiffany FM really is great stuff, I remember it too from those \"few\" years ago, haha!\nThank you for sharing this, what a lovely story -- and meaningful/clever gift as well!\nLADDM is a good one and a game changer for me. Haven't tried the Knize Ten yet. Generous samples is one of things in this hobby that I like best and I think benefits everyone -- you're more likely to find something you like and then support the seller or house that has offered to you.\nI think related to purchases is okay too.

I don\u2019t see how it can be an eau de parfum. To me it\u2019s<|endoftext|>"

It's not all good. In fact that's something I always liked in Dain, that she didn't advocate indiscriminate collecting. There is a useful aspect to it, in having tried sheer masses of products, but then there is a tendency to become less perceptive of each product.\nBut, eh, it's like that fantastic lipstick of the perfect shade, and zero staying power. Ultimately I won't be happy with it. I would choose a lipstick that's perhaps less in terms of the color, if it means I can put it on and forget about it, as long as possible.\nLikewise, I tossed the idea of Annick Goutal's eau de toilettes. Yes, they're cute, they're easy to find, and reasonably priced, relatively speaking...the lasting power just sucks. I chased down the more elusive Annick Goutal eau de parfum and found it to last as well as any other EDP.\nEtro was kind of a weird brand. I ended up with a full bottle of Heliotrope, which my kids love (always good to have a consultant or two).\nAnyhow, happy hunting! and do check back on this blog.\nDecember 28, 2007 2:30 PM, Dain said...\nI've heard that the Chanel exclusifs are very good, but of course, they are a mass-market brand's version of niche. I haven't smelled any of them, but talented perfumers and highest quality ingredients sounds like a promising mix. Guerlain is very tricky for me, Guerlinade is musty on me, but I do like L'Heure Bleue. If I had a house, it would be Caron. Caron never cheapens.\nYou know, Annick Goutals have never agreed with me? They are somehow... too cute, too benign. I think I prefer perfumes very strong opinions. Diptyque, I've only tried two, one was a big hit, the other a big miss. ETRO has very wearable, but unoriginal perfumes, I think. Serge Lutens, I think, gives you a real appreciation for raw materials--those two really know how to bring out a flavor, it's never the thing itself, but in a lot of ways, it is often better. I'm dead curious about Montale--I guess we'll see!\nDecember 28, 2007 11:43 PM, Colleen Shirazi said...\nThe odd thing is it's probably harder to get hold of a Chanel \"secret perfume\"--dunno, do they keep it behind the counter? :D than a plain old niche fragrance. The niche people were smart enough to start up sample programs, which go hand-in-hand with decant services.\nI've never had Guerlain work on me...have never tried Caron. Givenchy is my \"mainstream house,\" since I'm allergic to the older, better Chanels.\nAnnick Goutal is weirder than Etro if you think about it. Etro, overall, struck me as masculine, where AG struck me as feminine--but wildly differing. Not all of their scents are nice-girl concoctions. It's as if someone goes crazy in the lab late at night, and pops out something no one else has, that is too perfect. And then it's business as usual the next day.\nDecember 29, 2007 12:04 AM, Dain said...\nTo be honest, there are only a very sparing number of SLs I'd consider FBW, indeed Tubereuse Criminelle is alone assured. They are magnificent to appreciate, as one might savor fine wine in a restaurant, but it is quite another thing to buy a case of the vintage (approximately the relationship between decant and full-bottle, no?).\nHowever, I see what you mean, and I think your hunch is a good one. It is very French. But you know, Fleurs d'Oranger is one of the least impressive of the SLs, pretty but... And I have never tried Montale. We'll just have to see.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " linden: L'Artisan Parfumeur does a gorgeous linden for the house in their Tilleuls au Vent scented candle (see Robin's review of the room spray). I can't recall the scent entirely, but I do remember comparing it unlit directly to a linden flower with very little difference. Manuel Canovas does a nice home spray, of which I have only tried a sample, called Fleur de Coton. It's a bit more powdery than I prefer, but very nice nonetheless. Fresh makes one of their big fun triple milled soaps in Linden, which has a fresh green and slightly floral scent, vaguely reminiscent of linden but less true to the original flower than I find the others to be.\nRoger & Gallet Linden Moisturizing Shower Cream is $16 for 8.4 oz at beautyexclusive.\nNote: image of Tilia (linden) blossom by Magnus Manske via Wikimedia.\nOooh, I'll have to look for that wash.\nI fell in love with Linden when I found a body splash by a company called Formula f21C that was at Nieman Marcus. It is so\u2026. hot summer day smelling. More earthy than most florals. I find Linden things here and there, including tea, but I will definitely look for this wash. Hopefully there is lotion? I am a \u201clotion whore\u201d as one of my friends called me.\nLinden is so beautiful but so often in the US it's paired with white florals that make it too sweet and, well, FLORAL, when I think it smells best when its herbal side is emphasized.\nInterestingly, while there aren't that many popular linden fragrances in the US, in continental Europe it's a pretty popular \u201cgeneric\u201d scent, much like vanilla is the popular \u201cgeneric\u201d scent here. When I went to Amsterdam they had generic-brand linden bodywash and soap all over the place for 3 euros. I bought so much back home.\nBTW I think Linden is generic here in France because everyone is familiar with the scent, \u201cTilleul\u201d is just everywhere and is highly esteemed as a Tisane. Personally I prefer breakfast tea but then I am English. The scent is so good however that I inhale until my lungs are bursting. Can\u2019t get enough. Just wish the flowering season went on longer. Off to seek out another flowering tree; horse chestnut. It\u2019s up there with Linden, sweeter though.\nSorry, I brought* so much back home. It's very hard to BUY linden stuff in the US that isn't at an unreasonable price, like that Roger & Gallet's stuff.\nOoo, that body splash sounds mighty tempting. Wonder if it is still around? Will have to check\u2026.\nThere is indeed a lotion! There is also a bar soap. I haven't tried it in Linden, but the R&G soap in Green Tea is my favorite green tea scented product. I think Beauty Exclusive carries them all\u2026.\nIt's true, come to think of it, I definitely associate linden as a European scent, rather than American. I think of it as something one might come across regularly in the pharmacies over there, as opposed to only high-end beauty counters.\nI haven't tried a linden scent where the herbal side was emphasized\u2026that sounds intriguing. Hopefully linden as a whole will catch on this side of the pond as well (or the dollar will go back up)!\nI will definitely try that wash. I'm a huge fan of Linden, have been for many years. I like Jo Malone's French Lime Blossom but am always looking for another fragrance that does Linden justice. I've found a nice, rather inexpensive line, called Provence Sante, that carries a Tilleul fragrance and it's very nice. Does anyone know of other Linden fragrances? I mean Linden as the main act \u2013 not simply among the listed notes covered by other white florals\u2026 I think what another comment above suggests\u2026.Linden with other more herbal notes would be dreamy\u2026 thanks!\nI can confirm that. A lot of reasonably priced toiletries, scented with tilleul, can be found in French supermarkets (Monoprix, Carrefour, etc.).\nTilleul is my favourite 'tisane' (herb tea). I'm never without a couple of boxes of it in my cupboard. I like it with verbena too (Tilleul-Verveine'; you can get mixed sachets in France). It's lovely and calming. And it doesn't taste of grass.\nI was under the impression that I didn't like linden, because I'd tried it a number of times mixed with white flowers and found it off-putting. I guess it was a as-yet unsleuthed white flower that I was not enjoying, because I recently smelled a number of linden products and really liked them. Diptyque has a really gorgeous (but not cheap) room spray in Tilleul.\nYet another reason to go to France (as if another one was needed)!\nI would also love to hear of other linden fragrances. I wasn't crazy about the Jo Malone when I tried it\u2013but I may need to revisit it. Will have to explore Provence Sante!\nHope you love the wash!\nHa! I love the infusion, too. Although it's sweat-inducing. My mom used to give it to us when we had a cold before going to bed, so we would sweat out the illness. In Turkey it's one of the most common flavors for drinks. They even have linden granules for making instant drinks.\nSweat inducing? That's good to know!\nI would love to try a linden flavored drink\u2013again, does it taste the way the blossom smells?\nThat also reminds me of elderflower syrup\u2026that's a common flavor for drinks in Denmark. It's very refreshing when sweetened and mixed with sparkling water and lemon!\nHope you like the wash as well!\nWere any of the ones you smelled available online?\nOh no! Not another diptyque to fall in love with\u2026.a girl only has so much room in her heart, er, wallet!\nOh, I didn't know that. It doesn't have that effect on me at all. I just find it very fragrant and relaxing.\nTrue, it doesn't really smell/taste like the flower. It's very mild. Verbena gives it an extra little twist. It also reinforces the calming effect. They go very well together.\nI will definitely look for it next time I am at the supermarket. We have a local chain that carries a lot of imported tisanes/teas. Right now, I am also enjoying the abundance of lemon balm in my garden and making evening tisanes out of that.\nD'Orsay Tilleul is lovely \u2014 I think it's relatively true to the flower and has that kind of funky hay note that I think people either love or hate. I also think Bond Eau de Noho has linden in it, but it's set within other florals (violet?) Also, I thought Pre de Provence did a cheap, nice eau de toilette, but I can't find it online, so perhaps I'm thinking of the Provence Sante.\nI did a little research and I think that the company evolved (or devolved, however you want to think about it) into Fresh. They make a Formula f21c skin wash that has Linden in it, and a Linden soap. I also saw an old review of some other linden stuff I had \u2013 a Linden Honey body wash that was made by Fresh.\nThanks for the info! I've tried the Fresh Linden soap\u2013it's nice, but not love. Will keep an eye out for that skinwash though, and honey sounds nice too!\nI will have to try out D'Orsay Tilleul. So far I've enjoyed linden more in the home/body product area than in perfumes, but true to flower and funky hay note sounds like it could be the 'one'!\nHi \u2013 I'm new here, just saying I have enjoyed your blog a lot. Thanks for the great articles. You have a way with words!! I swear, I just can't break down notes in perfumes at all. I know what I like and what I don't, and that's it. Maybe I'll learn a thing or two here.\nHi Elizabeth and welcome! This is Robin's blog, not mine, lol, but I'm glad you enjoy it\u2013I do too! I am sure you will indeed learn a lot about perfumes from her and the others if you continue reading! Be warned though, it can be addictive!\nI live on a street lined by linden trees on both sides. Imagine my excitement when I discovered they were linden trees, but the bloom never carried a scent, and they are white, not yellow like in the picture. They bloom early in the summer, so there's no heat to carry the fragrance, if any. The only thing attracted to these trees are Japanese beetles. I wonder if there's an American linden variety that is scent-less.\nJo Malone's French Lime Blossom does a good job, and there's also a nice soap made by Provence Sante called Tilleul.\nHow sad that you cannot smell your lindens<|endoftext|>"

I need a wide toe box because if a neuroma but don\u2019t have wide feet so it\u2019s always a challenge for me.\nMaybe their \u201cscandals\u201d are great, too????. And I\u2019ll add that they have good arch support and a Birkenstock-like foot bed in most.\nThose are super cute, and come in several colors! I just spent some quality time on the Naot site \u2013 thanks so much for the tip. It looks like they have a nice assortment of shoes in wide widths. Sweet!\nI\u2019d recommend Naot and Dansko too \u2013 very comfortable sandals from both lines. Also would add Papillio which is brand licensed by Birkenstock\u2026 Funkier and more colourful styles. And Taos\u2026 they are heavenly!\nI get them from Shoes dot com though since they are somewhat discounted.\nI am a loyal Birkenstock wearer, have you tried them? They do come in a thong style also.\nSome of my co-workers swear by Alegria or Dansko for comfort and I know both brands make sandal styles. Good luck!\nI have a pair of Birkenstocks for water (all rubber and some sort of rubber-like straps), and they fit, but the regular Birkies seem to be a bit narrower. But it\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve tried them, so maybe I need to try again.\nI\u2019ve tried the Algerias in the clogs, but not the sandals. I\u2019ll do some research on who carries these; it may be time to get brave and finally order from Zappos.\nOMG, Zappos is THE BEST! I order one day and they are on my doorstep the next! I love them.\nI\u2019ll 2nd elisap and mtg with the Birkenstock and Dansko recommendations. I also want to say that Birkenstocks make wide-width sandals? Dansko also has some really cute sandals out for the summer.\nI mostly wear clog sandals in the summer, but most brands are actually quite narrow so that\u2019s probably not an option. I also love my Mephisto Helens, but again, I prefer them because they\u2019re more narrow than Birks.\nSo true, the flip flops need to go!\nI\u2019ll look at the Mephistos, though, they might have something that would work. Thanks for the suggestions!\nThese are my shoe needs, too! I have purchased two pair of Ziera shoes in the past few months, and I\u2019m very happy with them. Not cheap, but they seem very well made and *fingers crossed* they will last a while.\nSadly, my favorite Merrill clogs are no longer being made\u2013I keep hoping to find a pair on some warehouse site, but so far, no luck!\nOops. Just realized that my sandals are another brand\u2013Abeo. I wear something similar to these about 6 months out of the year...\nThanks, Marjorie Rose, there is a Walking Company at the mall downtown. I had totally forgotten. Methinks I need to take a day trip!\nAnd thanks for the Ziera suggestions as well. Those look sooo plush, like they were custom made.\nHey, what is it with Merrell, anyway? They do discontinue styles way too often. I like the clogs that have the netting, for lack of a better word, and they still seem to make those.\nI know it\u2019s a hassle to buy online and from overseas, but a local company, Ziera, once called Kumfs\u2014 that\u2019s the real clue\u2014 was started by podiatrists for people who have to wear orthotics. Their shoes usually have a fashion element\u2014 my red boots are Kumfs \u2014and are designed for feet as well as the current \u201clook\u201d. I have a nuisance of a neuroma in my right foot and don\u2019t wear heels at all these days, but I usually manage to find something slightly stylish at Ziera. The company is very good to deal with. You might have some luck there, maybe.\nHey, great minds! I buy my Ziera shoes here in the States at a local shop called Shoe Mill. I agree, they do a good job of balancing fashion and comfort.\nGreat minds indeed! I have a lot of options to explore now. Thank you, waterdragon!\nIt looks like Ziera has an online shop in the US, too. I\u2019ll have to browse\u2026 Although I\u2019ve recently started wearing small-sized men\u2019s shoes to suit my wide feet, at least for athletic shoes.\nTaking notes from this. I have wide, wide feet, low arches, narrow heel. Birkies and Naot seem to taper too much for me. I do have some Ahnu sandals, which tend to run wide and have elastic backing. Gonna check out Ziera.\nGood morning all, happy holidays, happy spring.\n2. Any Archipelago candle, possibly Charleston for spring (jasmine, tuberose, and hyacinth).\n4.?? Maybe a 6-carat tsavorite garnet ring I have seen in a jewellery store\u2013the most beautiful shade of green ever\u2013even prettier than an emerald imho, and probably more expensive, too!\nThe Easter Bunny brought a present to my mom this week when the pigeon eggs in Nest #1 on her condo balcony hatched.

This has become a testing weekend \u2013 yesterday\u2019s sample was Slowdive, and this morning I\u2019m sampling Trayee. Slowdive is going to require more time to see if I come to appreciate the honey note and whatever the oddness in the top notes is (tuberose? maple sap?). Trayee is quite pleasant, but much less complex than its notes listing would suggest. Could be it just needs a heavier dose than is easy to get out of a one ml sample.\n1. Perfume: A bell jar of Boxeuses.\n2. Other scented gift: FM Iris Poudre or L\u2019Eau D\u2019Hiver body butter or cream.\n3. Favorite candy: I don\u2019t really have a favorite, but I always enjoy caramels. Especially the square, chocolate-covered ones with sea salt sprinkled on top.\n4. Random gift: Well, since this is fantasy \u2026 I saw a gorgeous, very simple, oval-cut, pale green amethyst ring years ago while waiting for a watch battery to be replaced, and have been looking for something similar (but affordable) ever since. Bunny, if you could time-travel, or just conjure it up, that would be wonderful.\nTrayee is growing on me quickly. Is it too late to change my fantasy?\n1. I would love to have a bottle of Rose de Nuit.\n2. Amouage Epic body lotion is my pick.\n3. I bought myself the Harry and David chocolate covered Bing cherries for Easter. I also got myself tons of Malley\u2019s chocolate as well.\n4. The random thing would have to be somebody to to replace my Nano\u2019s battery or get me a new iPod touch.\nI know that I have some expensive tastes.

        "passage": "Thanks to its powerful healing effect and distinctive woody aroma, sandalwood has been highly valued for thousands of years. Extracted from sandalwood, essential oils are extensively used for making excuisite perfumes and scented candles, in skin care industry and aromatherapy. This fragrant wood has been a part of religious and spiritual traditions of India, China, Tibet and Japan, as well as an important medicament for these ancient civilizations. And this is not all. According to the scientific evidence, its sensual fragrance has a strong erotic effect on our senses.\nUnlike some other aromatic woods, sandalwood (a class of fragrant woods from trees in the genus Santalum) keeps its rich, sweet and warm scent for decades. Blended with other fragrances that tend to evenish quickly, a sandalwood oil serves as the base note that both enhances them and helps them last longer. As a harmonizing agent, it brings together other aromas, without overpowering them. All these qualities make sandalwood oil one of the most valuable ingredients of the high-end natural fragrance products.\nSpeaking about luxury scented candles, sandalwood appears as one of the most refined fragrances, capable to make a divine atmosphere in your personal space. According to the spiritual traditions of the East, its sensual flavor calms and focuses the mind and relieves anxiety, which makes it perfect for meditation and other spiritual practices or simply for the quick recovery from a hard day. Besides, it is a strong aphrodisiac that can nicely complement a romantic evening, by relieving tension and mental blocks. Scientists discovered that the chemical effects of the sandalwood fragrance are very similar to those of androsterones (human pheromones), produced by male and female metabolic hormones. Thus, by using the scent of sandalwood, you will emit pretty effective erotic signal to the opposite sex.\nThere are plenty of high-quality scented candles, based on sandalwood aroma. Nest comes with a Mahogany Classic Candle that mixes sandalwood with star anise and patchouli, underlighed with the sweetness of vanilla and caramel praline. Bringing the spirit od the Far East, Voluspa Baltic Amber 3 Wick Tin Candle offers a very interesting blend of amber resin, sandalwood, cedar and vanilla orchid. I also highly recommend Diptyque Santal (Sandalwood) Candle, as well as Trapp Patchouli Sandalwood candle. Finally, there is a remarkable Delirium Samurai Woods candle, presenting a mystical blend of incense, bergamot, nutmeg, sandalwood, patchouli and blondewoods.\nDue to the deficient resource of these precious woods, the price of sandalwood oil goes up dramatically, which leads to the emergence of fake products on the market. If you are a fan of scented products based on sandalwood aroma, you should be aware of this fact. Be careful when buying them and if you do not want to risk, choose brands with high reputation.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "With Bangkok enduring wave after wave of COVID-19 (Indian and African variants included), it\u2019s safe to say we are all in need of something calming and meditative for this period. Scents can be very effective, and a change of perfume can be invigorating and work wonders for the nerve. Here are some oriental-inspired fragrances to evoke a sense of zen and wabi-sabi in you.\nMaison Louis Marie\u2019s Le Long Fond is a woody symphony perfect for any gender. It marries hinoki wood accord with darker notes of cedarwood, patchouli and amber. This is a warming scent perfect for a day at home or late night contemplations.\nAesop\u2019s R\u014dzu is both sensually and aesthetically calming with its bottle of brown glass. This floral and woody combination interestingly combines notes of rose with the green and woody notes of shiso and guaiac wood.\nShop Aesop\u2019s R\u014dzu here.\nWabi-sabi emerged from the art of tea ceremony, and so it is most fitting that Le Labo Th\u00e9 Noir 29 Eau de parfum is included in the list. Th\u00e9 Noir 29 itself is a celebration of tea and the craft of tea-making. It infuses light notes of bergamot, fig and bay with a more contemplative nose of tea-leaf, cedarwood, vetiver and musk.\nShop Le Labo\u2019s Th\u00e9 Noir 29 here.\nWhat\u2019s in the name? Diptyque\u2019s Kimonanthe aptly harks to both the kimono and osmanthus. The perfume pays homage to Japan through incense powder and osmanthus\u2014a small white flower with a unique scent of apricot and leather. This is a rounded scent that where candied fruit, leather and spice harmoniously meet.\nThese two new additions to Aman\u2018s fine fragrance collection take inspirations from the brand\u2019s flagship hotel, Aman Tokyo and Amangiri, the Utah desert retreat.\nInspired by Aman Tokyo and named after the Japanese word for spring, Haru features delicate layers of floral and fruity. One can expect notes of soft apricot and green-tea accents with hints of musk and tobacco designed to evoke the spirit of Tokyo traditions.\nOn the other hand, Sei is a more mysterious scent designed to capture the sense of nightfall in a desert. It combines pine needle and juniper with notes of dry safe and lavender. Rooted in the wilderness of nature, its earthy, woody scent is accented with cedarwood and ciste labdanum.\nThe post 5 Calming Fragrances to Capture the Scents of Wabi-Sabi appeared first on Prestige Online \u2013 Thailand.<|endoftext|>"

Born in Hollywood, raised in Los Angeles County, and educated at the University of California, Irvine, Pridipun says it wasn\u2019t until she moved to Beverly Hills in 2012 that her \u201clife went on the fast track.\u201d Within a few years, she\u2019d met her husband, got married, started a family (her kids are now 2 and 4), and landed her dream job: director of sales at The Beverly Hilton.\nIn that role Pridipun is responsible for creating the best guest experience in Beverly Hills, working with high-profile tourism groups and corporations in need of a special place to stay. Each year starts in a glamorous way with bookings tied to major award shows\u2014the hotel\u2019s International Ballroom has been the red-carpet home to glitzy Hollywood events for over 50 years.\nCOVID-19, of course, made things a bit complicated early in 2021, but Pridipun and team leaned into their creativity, offering rooftop screenings of major motion pictures as a sort of pandemic pivot and inviting guests to watch from a private terrace in the hotel.\nNow that travel is in full swing, Pridipun is back to what she does best: showcasing her hotel and city to win the business of guests who can choose to go anywhere in the world. Located in the heart of sunny Los Angeles and famous for unparalleled luxury and exceptional style, Beverly Hills isn\u2019t exactly a tough spot to pitch. \u201cThe fashion and delicious cuisines\u2014it\u2019s paradise to me,\u201d says Pridipun, who recommends Yves Saint Laurent for purses, Diptyque for perfume, and Le Mervetty for classic French pastries like macarons or the must-try Le Merveilleux..\nFor a perfect day in Beverly Hills, Pridipun recommends going full glitz and glamour. Start by booking a classic cabana room overlooking the Hilton\u2019s iconic Aqua Star Pool, the largest in L.A. Then head over to Rodeo Drive to browse luxury shops and \u201cget that Hollywood movie experience.\u201d Don\u2019t miss Via Rodeo, a little cobblestone offshoot that \u201cfeels like you\u2019re in Europe\u201d and Beverly Boulevard for more high-fashion finds.\nDo brunch at celeb hotspot The Ivy, where Pridipun orders the lobster ravioli, before museum hopping at The Getty, LACMA (Los Angeles County Museum of Art), or the La Brea Tar Pits. Just before sunset, make your way to Canon Drive for a photo op. \u201cIf no one is there, you can get one of those famous shots in the middle of the street with palm trees all lined up in the background,\u201d she says.\nGet a super-exclusive dining experience at Nozawa Bar, a secret 10-seat sushi room inside of Sugarfish from acclaimed Japanese chef Osamu Fujita. If a rooftop dinner with spectacular views appeals, just head upstairs from your cabana to the Beverly Hills Hilton\u2019s Sant\u2019olina; the Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills\u2019 Rooftop by JG is another gorgeous option. Then head to the Sunset Strip (\u201cabsolutely the best nightlife\u201d) to keep the party going into the wee hours.\nPridipun always encourages guests to get out and try new things, including these only-in-Beverly Hills experiences.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "The reality is I am usually lathered in a scent I have created the night before - it is the best way for me to test a creation and decide whether it has a future in the collection. When you make perfume, you also start to understand that the brands charging hundreds for their scents are usually paying ten fold for the box and bottle compared to the oil contained within them. It therefore takes A LOT for me to buy a perfume.\nSites like Fragrantica and Basenotes have their uses - on the whole though, reviewing is an art that not many people are skilled at. Unfortunately the loudest voices have often declared themselves the masters of taste and drown out some of the more helpful reviews. That is right folks, reviews are supposed to be helpful. These sites are however a huge catalogue of what is out there and an amazing place to discover the houses you never knew existed.\nComme des Garcons produce some of my favourite scents. What they do with synthetic notes is marvellous to me and though not everything is necessarily what you would reach for daily, they are bottles of art. \"Zagorsk\" reflects my love of green scents and in my opinion is the best in the Incense series. The pine note is electrifying and the incense here is cold and metallic. I also regularly wear the scent \"Tar\" from the Synthetic collection. It does what it says on the tin. Think warm, hard tennis court and you are about there. Linear and predictable yet beautiful simplicity. A pet peeve of mine is when someone says \"It smells amazing, but not as a perfume - I would like it as a candle or room-spray.\" In the end perfumes fragrance the space around you - whether the vessel to do that is a candle, diffuser or your skin, does not matter at all to me. I frequently use Feu de Bois room spray from Diptyque on my skin and clothes - if they made a perfume I can guarantee the oil content would be less and the price much higher! Yes it does not diffuse as well (room diffusers use a base which evaporates less rapidly) but it is still beautiful and one of my favourite woodsmoke scents.\nTalking of woodsmoke that takes me on to one of the best out there (other than Rook by Rook that is). I tend to buy a new fragrance whenever I visit a new city. Call it an olfactory fridge magnet. On my first trip to the Vatican I found a beautiful perfumery and that is where I bought \"Bois d'Ascese\" by Naomi Goodsir. This throws out a wonderfully rich plume of warm and aromatic smoke. Is it balsamic and ambery and has a wonderful oakmoss in the base.\nLet's move on to a couple of dislikes. My first would be \"Santal\" by Le Labo. An element of this is probably from over exposure. The other is a possible reformulation. After the Lauder take over It seems to have lost its journey and the dill pickle vibe really turned up. The house of Le Labo has some lesser worn but wonderful scents. Their \"Patchouli\" is challenging and complex and on the more gentle end of the scale, their \"Guaiac\" from the city specials series is superb. My next big dislikes are \"Neroli Portofino\" by<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "If you were to ask me my favorite part of working in the beauty industry, my answer would be hands down for the fragrance. I've always found myself fascinated by fragrances\u2014nothing jolts my memory quite like a smell, and in my head, everyone I know has a particular smell that I associate with them, even if I can't quite put my finger on it.\nI went to Sephora when I received my first-ever paycheck and took the scent quiz to find my ideal perfume. It was Tom Ford Black Orchid, which I immediately made my signature, and my love for fragrance has only grown since. The top of my dresser is overflowing with fragrances that I cycle through. I have a scent for any and every occasion.\nWhether you're already a seasoned fragrance person or looking to dabble, these are the quintessential perfume brands that any scent lover should consider. Keep scrolling for 20 of the best perfume brands and the specific bottle we'd recommend from each.\nIf you love fragrance, you should absolutely invest in a Byredo perfume. These scents are unexpected and all represent an emotion or memory in a bottle. Mixed Emotions is unexpected in all the right ways\u2014it's perfect for this specific moment in time, when everything feels like a swirling question mark. Comforting notes are sharply interrupted by more jarring ones, making this fragrance a true exploration of what it feels like to have mixed emotions.\nI could write about this scent a million times and never feel like I've said enough about it. It's a subtle skin scent that reads floral but not in a typically floral way\u2014it's creamy, like seafoam and sticky skin during a perfect day at the beach.\nI've never met a Tom Ford perfume that I didn't fall head over heels in love with. Every Tom Ford fragrance could be a special-occasion scent or a daily perfume. Lost Cherry is a fragrance that's in a league of its own\u2014most cherry fragrances (of which there are few) end up smelling like cough syrup. Lost Cherry is the most gourmand interpretation of the fruit, with booze-soaked cherries at the base surrounded by warm notes that keep it approachable.\nKrigler perfumes don't just deserve a spot on your vanity\u2014they should be center stage. These historical scents will make you smell like the glamorous movie stars and public figures of a bygone era. This particular scent was Jacqueline Kennedy's signature\u2014and once you smell the harmonic balance between spicy, sweet, and musky notes, it's easy to understand why.\nAdmittedly, I've complained before that every trendy bar in New York City smells like it was doused in Santal 33\u2014it's long been the fragrance du jour of cool New Yorkers. At the end of the day, there's a reason for the cult following. Santal 33 smells downright alluring. This woodsy scent absolutely flourishes on skin, mixing perfectly with everyone's unique body chemistry. I don't care how ubiquitous it is, I'll walk through a cloud of Santal 33 any day.\nMaison Francis Kurkdjian fragrances are worth every penny. One whiff of any scent from the brand will easily convince you that perfume is an art form, and this scent is living proof of that. It's tough to create a perfume with vanilla notes that doesn't come off as cloying, but this one nails it. It's sexy, sweet in a soft way, and different.\nLike a hazy summer night at a beach house with vinyl playing, this scent will instantly make you feel at ease. All D.S. & Durga fragrances come with a curated Spotify playlist to help give you a sense of what the specific scent evokes\u2014you can listen to Rose Atlantic's here.\nEvery Diptyque fragrance takes me back to wandering cobbled streets in Paris, perfectly tipsy after a glass of champagne at a caf\u00e9. These French-crafted scents each feel elevated in their own way. Olene feels like a bottled version of A Midsummer Night's Dream\u2014inflorescent and magical.\nJo Malone has perfected the art of keeping fragrances unexpected but still wearable. It's not every day you see bay leaves in a fragrance, but Jo Malone manages to pull it off by blending them with blackberries and cedar for a perfume that's both vegetal and jammy.\nKilian perfumes are gorgeous and endlessly refillable, which we appreciate when thinking of spending major money on a fragrance. Rolling in Love is a warm, floral fragrance that manages to smell incredibly opulent.\nIf you're looking for perfumes that bend the concept of gender, Boy Smells scents are a great place to start. To date, I've never worn Rose Load without at least one person adding the scent into their notes app to remember for themselves. Rose scents can be powdery and smell like something a grandmother might wear, but this one is a spicy, woodsy take on rose that's basically a compliment magnet.\nEscentric Molecules is known for using Iso E Super to create scents that almost make you smell like you're not wearing perfume. It's a unique note that's often in the background of perfumes, but Escentric Molecules lets you get up close and personal with it. This one smells creamy and subtly floral.\nClean Reserve makes approachable, affordable scents that just smell comforting. Warm Cotton smells like taking a fresh load of laundry out of the dryer. It's warm, soft, and soothing.\nI'm consistently impressed by the range that Sol de Janiero fragrances have. Each one feels like a different, unique slice of Brazil. Cheirosa '68 Beija Flor is a truly unique floral\u2014it smells like wandering through someone's private garden in Rio.\n The brand's scents are complex and undeniably special. This rose-forward fragrance is feminine but mysterious, making it the perfect scent for the modern woman.\nYSL perfumes are the ideal scents for true fashion people. They're chic and edgy and feel like the perfect finishing accessory for every outfit. Black Opium is a fragrance lover's staple\u2014it draws people in and goes with everything.\nDior perfumes are legendary for a reason. Miss Dior has been around since 1947 and has seen many iterations since then. The latest take on the iconic fragrance is bursting with fresh blooms and electrifies your senses.\nI'd be remiss to not include Chanel on this list. The brand is always ahead of its time, and that includes its interpretation of fragrance\u2014after all, its scents have been around since 1921. This scent has whipped together fruit with florals for a perfectly balanced spritz.\nAtelier Cologne has mastered the art of simple, ultra-wearable scents. I'd wear this fragrance everywhere, from the farmers market to a night out.\nKey notes: bergamot, nutmeg, rhubarb, lychee, Turkish rose, vetiver, incense, cedar, vanilla, cashmeran, musk.\nIf the lavish bottles don't convince you that you're in need of a Parfums de Marly fragrance, the scents should speak for themselves. These perfumes are the encapsulation of modern luxury. Delina is a hyper-feminine scent that sparkles on skin.<|endoftext|>"

The sun is lingering in Brussels in the early evening. The air is mild. There are friends, good clients, perfume enthusiasts, the press and the entire Senteurs d\u2019Ailleurs team. Everyone is happy to be together again! Amid the glasses of champagne, alcohol-free cocktails and delicious little \u2018things\u2019 to munch on, a joyful babble muffles the discussions. Because everyone is talking about the same thing: the new diptyque \u2018Shop in the Shop\u2019 at Senteurs d\u2019Ailleurs and the presentation of \u2018Le Grand Tour\u2019 collection.\nSince January 2021, Senteurs d\u2019Ailleurs (Perfumerie) is home to a new \u2018corner\u2019 dedicated to the diptyque perfume house. The complete diptyque universe! This is unique in Belgium. Decoration includes lacquered natural wood, black marble, a beautiful piece of metalwork to present an assortment of diptyque candles, perfumes, and care products.\nTo celebrate its 60th anniversary, diptyque is taking us on a journey. From the west to the east. Destination: Paris, Venice, Milies (in Greece), Kyoto and Byblos (in Lebanon). Iconic cities, well loved by the creators at Diptyque, come to life in five limited edition perfume creations. Their historical feel and natural environment are sources of inspiration for perfumers and artists alike.\nToday, each chosen stopover is once again embodied in an exclusive scented trail: candles, perfumes, and scented ovals, imagined by the brand\u2019s creators and divinely \u2018packaged\u2019 for the occasion. It is also an opportunity for diptyque to celebrate what has shaped it since its creation: a taste for elsewhere, art and perfumes, with the \u2018Voyages Immobiles - Le Grand Tour\u2019 exhibition, at the Poste du Louvre, Paris (until 24 October 2021).\nIn the beginning, there were three friends, Desmond Knox-Leet, a young English painter, Christiane Gautrot, a graduate in decorative arts and Yves Coueslant, an actor/decorator. After travelling quite extensively, they bought a small decorating shop in Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s to sell collections of coloured fabrics and unusual objects that they had brought back from their worldwide travels. The boutique was named \u2018Diptyque\u2019 due to the two windows on the street corner. In the midst of this \u2018bazaar chic\u2019, Desmond decided to offer the finest in English perfumery, and then he and his associates started making potpourri and pomander.\nIn 1963, they marketed their first scented candles: \u2018Hawthorn\u2019, \u2018Cinnamon\u2019 and \u2019Tea\u2019 (the latter was totally new at the time). Quality candles with a high percentage of fragrance concentration: 8\u201312% of the candle weight (often less than 2% for ordinary candles). The fragrances are composed by perfumers. The first versions were made with labels (black and white) that were hand-glued on glasses bought at the Bazar de l\u2019H\u00f4tel de Ville. These (very handmade) beginnings make you smile when you know that today more than half a million diptyque scented candles are made every year!\nAt the end of the 1960s, the House launched its first fragrance, \u2018L'Eau\u2019, inspired by a British formula from the 16th century, an astonishing elixir with notes of rose, cinnamon, geranium, clove, and sandalwood. A success! This was followed by \u2018L'Eau Lente\u2019, with Indian spices, and \u2018Olene\u2019, a floral water with wisteria, narcissus, jasmine, and honeysuckle.\nToday, the \u2018little\u2019 French luxury brand exports Parisian chic to some 1,200 high-end outlets and 50 own-name boutiques in 45 countries around the world.<|endoftext|>"

Doing more of the same is not an option.\nWhich is why Luxasia co-invested $2 million in home-grown beauty appointment-booking app Vanitee in July last year. \u201cIt\u2019s a concierge business that\u2019s related to ours. We don\u2019t run it; we encourage our business partners (like LVMH, Coty, Elizabeth Arden and Yves Rocher) to use Vanitee,\u201d says Alwyn, who, together with sister Sabrina, brought the start-up to Chong\u2019s attention. Sixteen-month-old Vanitee has a network of over 550 verified independent beauty artists, who have since served over 4,700 customers.\nBut more than being a complementary service, what impressed Chong most about Vanitee was its founders and their \u201ccan-do\u201d attitude. \u201cThey are constantly innovating and opening new markets.\nWhile Asian parents are said to be less open-minded and slow to praise their off spring, it\u2019s not the case with Chong. While filming a video segment for The Peak, he sought his children\u2019s opinion on answering questions posed, instead of making the executive decision. You also see the quiet pride in his eyes as he brings to attention Alwyn\u2019s success with Escentials, a concept store that the latter developed 14 years ago when he joined Luxasia as a marketing executive, as well as having made inroads into the tough China market \u2013 he was based in Shanghai for six years. And without Sabrina at the helm of the supporting functions in the group, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t have a business that would be sustainable in the long term\u201d.\nAnd of course, the entrepreneurial spirit in this new generation of start-ups reminds him of himself.\nHe stumbled onto the beauty scene 40 years ago, after then-employer British company Inchcape posted him to its fragrances and cosmetics department, instead of the wines and spirits sector he had requested. \u201cI was apprehensive because I didn\u2019t know if it was the right business for me,\u201d recalls Chong, whose original aspiration was to be a pilot but changed his mind because the pay wasn\u2019t attractive. \u201cI can put my hand over my heart and say that I couldn\u2019t have joined a better industry. Resources were limited and that forced me to be creative when it came to building partnerships.\u201d To address an infrastructure gap that Inchcape couldn\u2019t plug then, Chong set up Luxasia in 1986 to serve the Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippine markets.\n\u201cWhen we go to new markets, we always try to hire locals because they know the markets better than us. But how do you attract the right person? Does he have the passion and is he up to challenges? To build and sustain the business, it has always been about attracting and retaining the right talent. People should stay or come to us because we offer a fair deal.\u201d By that, he is referring to a conducive environment for creativity, allowing staff to run the business as their own, while remunerating them at market rate with appropriate recognition and incentives to inspire their best performance.\nThat includes finding his successor. Privately held Luxasia may be a family business, but Chong makes no bones about finding the best qualified person as the next leader \u2013 which may not be his children. Bangkok-based Alwyn oversees Luxasia\u2019s China, Thailand and Philippine markets, while former corporate lawyer Sabrina joined four years ago and is group head of corporate development. Chong\u2019s younger daughter is a doctor.\n\u201cNOT SURE WHAT HE THOUGHT I COULD DO WITH IT.\u201d \u2013 ALWYN ON BEING PAID WITH A GOLD STICKER AS A CHILD.\nTo enhance customer experience, the revamped Escentials store at Paragon now includes a vanity corner where shoppers can try out products.\n\u201cIt\u2019s vital to separate ownership from management,\u201d Chong says. \u201cWe need to plan for succession. If the right talent happens to be from the family \u2013 great. But the family must be far-sighted and open to finding someone from outside.<|endoftext|>"

Unfortunately, much as it is a lovely nourishing, moisturising balm, the fragrance is not very strong. I\u2019ve read reviews that say it could be worn instead of a perfume but this isn\u2019t my experience, unless you actually put your arm to your nose and sniff! It is nice as a moisturiser though. I should just have stuck to the body lotion.\nRated 5 out of 5 by SarahC1510 from Rich and nourishing This is a really lovely product. A luxury body balm is such a treat and this one is up there as one of the best I have tried. It has a lovely rich, nourishing texture but does not leave a greasy film on the skin. It absorbs easily and really nourishes the skin. Plus it smells divine. A winner.\nRated 5 out of 5 by cookie5 from A real must have. Wow!!! this is truly a gorgeous body balm, at first it seems a bit greasy but this does not last long as it absorbs into your skin beautifully leaving a fabulous glow, your skin is left moisturised which lasts all day and the fragrance is stunning, you really can\u2019t go wrong with this, I know it\u2019s pricey but a little goes a long way, it\u2019s the best product I have ever used on my skin.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "When not one but two of us here at Beauticate are convinced that stylist, publicist and entrepreneur Hayley Bonham is the missing Olsen sister, you know we must be onto something. Sure, it could just be the razor-sharp cheekbones, huge green eyes and effortlessly tousled flaxen locks, but when you notice her love for relaxed chic (very The Row) and a killer instinct for sniffing out the next big thing, you\u2019ll agree there must be some secret shared DNA. We met up with Hayley in her beautiful Sydney home where we chatted about her natural yet disciplined approach to beauty, and her plans to turn her brand new luxe co-working and events venue, La Porte Space, into an empire.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like wearing a lot of makeup and tend to use mostly light coverage products on my skin \u2013 I think it\u2019s about letting your skin shine through.\nI\u2019m completely obsessed with RMS and dab on \u201cUn\u201d Cover-Up in shade 33 where I need it. I usually get my lashes tinted, because I don\u2019t like wearing mascara in general. When I do use it, I prefer using brown mascara, as a makeup artist friend of mine said it works really well with green eyes. I never wear black mascara. There are a few great organic brands that I\u2019m liking at the moment. I also like to wear brown eyeliner, often NARS Kohliner in Sorrento.\nFor brows I love Kevyn Aucoin brow pencils and I finish with Chantecaille brow gel \u2013 I also see Kristen Fisher who creates beautiful and natural brows. If I want more coverage, I reach for NARS Sheer Glow Foundation in Barcelona. I\u2019ve been wearing it for five years and I love it \u2013 it\u2019s just really glowy, dewy and super light. \nI have been using Rationale skincare products for the past year and my skin has transformed; I honestly couldn\u2019t live without them.\nMy aunty had been raving about them for about five years, so I had dabbled in it, but I hadn\u2019t picked up the full system. Then working on shoots I found a lot of makeup artists really advocated the brand. At first I was a little bit apprehensive about using so many steps and thought maybe I wouldn\u2019t have time to do this, but then I ended up trying it for two weeks and it completely changed my skin.\nEach morning I splash my face with cold water to stimulate blood flow, then I apply my Immunologist Serum and Super Antioxidant Serum, and I use my jade roller to help the product further absorb into my skin as well as assist with lymphatic drainage. Rolling also helps sculpt your cheekbones and around your jawline, if you\u2019re feeling a bit puffy. It smooths everything out. Then I apply the PhotoDynamic Day Cream and Beautiful Skin Super Fluid SPF50. I work quite late, so I try to keep my evening routine simple. I cleanse my face with the ProCeramide Cleanser, followed by the Catalyst Serum and DNA Night Cream. It usually takes me five minutes, max.\nI also really love using masks, mainly by SK-II and Chanel.\nI use Kiehl\u2019s Epidermal Re-Texturizing Micro-Dermabrasion for exfoliating, and then go in with my trusty SK-II masks, which are also great to travel with. I love the little eye masks by Chanel, both for their line-plumping effect and because they\u2019re so pretty. And then I have their hydrating mask, which is really lovely as well. I started to feel bad because I had so much skincare, so I ended up giving everything away except what I really use.\nIf I could only use one product forever, it would have to be fragrance.\nI started a fragrance brand (Maison D\u2019Amore) with my best friend Nadia Rosa four years ago, as we are both infatuated with scent. It is just a big passion project for the two of us. We ended up connecting with an amazing perfumer in Paris who does a lot of work for Byredo and Diptyque. I gravitate so strongly towards fragrance because it evokes memories, and you can become someone or something different when you\u2019re wearing a different scent.\nI generally go between two Le Labo scents, Santal 33 and Th\u00e9 Noir 29, and I also wear either Byredo\u2019s La Tulipe or Gypsy Water for something more feminine. Each day before I walk out the door I will spray one of these fragrances, depending on my mood and the weather.\nThe overseas travel I did as a stylist reinforced to me that there were no working and event spaces in Australia that bridged the gap between lifestyle and functionality, like there were in Europe.\nMy first job in the industry was 12 years ago at Sass and Bide, in international sales. From there I\u2019d developed a very keen interest in styling and wanted to branch into PR or into the magazine world, and ended up moving into PR for a few years. I assisted a whole bunch of stylists for a long time. Then about seven years ago I signed with Vivien\u2019s Creative, after which I was doing a lot of my own stuff. In between all of that, a lot of clients who I had built relationships with were asking me to do some freelance PR with them, so that\u2019s how BON\u00c9L PR came about. We look after a lot of Parisienne clients, so while travelling there and working out of beautiful spaces, we realised there was a real opportunity to create something similar in Australia. Everything here was very much a blank canvas, or very corporate and clinical.\nAfter turning 30, I started looking at beauty from the inside out. I have been on a plant-based diet now for a year and half and it\u2019s just life changing.\nI eat a little bit of fish but no other meat, and no dairy. It\u2019s been hard, but it\u2019s crazy how much better I feel for it. I tried a million different things and went to different naturopaths, before finally finding a great GP with a holistic bent. My immune system just kept getting really beaten down and I couldn\u2019t figure out what was causing it. It\u2019s tricky to work out because we all just think \u2018well, I\u2019m so busy\u2019, but maybe it\u2019s actually because I\u2019m busy \u2013 that is, maybe my tendency to be on the go all the time is part of why I feel unwell.\nI start each morning with a glass of warm water with apple cider vinegar and a squeeze of lemon, then make a smoothie with The Beauty Chef Glow Powder, leafy greens, alkaline water, hemp seeds, maca and some frozen banana.\nI love Pilates. I\u2019ve been doing it twice a week for over a year and obviously since opening up La Porte Wellness it\u2019s just become so convenient.\nI also walk everywhere in the morning. I\u2019ve found that exercising how I used to doesn\u2019<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "bridled floral. Yes, the Hermessences were very exciting for perfume freaks when they first came out \u2013 before we were drowned in so much niche in the intervening years we could no longer see the wood for the trees. At the time, all these exclusifs from the major French houses were watched closely by every overexcited fumehead such as myself because they represented a potentially exhilarating luxury alternative to the mainstream, some polished unconventionality, something soaringly unique, but in eventually always hewing to the pallid transparency that seemed to be required by the French leather giant in all the uninspiring perfumes that came out one after the other such as Le Jour D\u2019Herm\u00e8s. Kelly Caleche, Voyage etc etc etc, for me at least there was always an unpleasant, metallic wanness; something sharp and glassy that got on my nerves.\nPreviously, in his earlier, more full and orchestral phase, the perfumer had been freer, less constricted, making such gorgeous perfumes as Van Cleef & Arpels First, Sisley Eau De Campagne \u2013 so original, so green and perfect in summer \u2013 as was his Eau Parfum\u00e9e au The Vert for Bulgari which I still wear on lazy Sundays, and the incredibly beautiful Eau Du Navigateur for L\u2019Artisan Parfumeur, one of my personal holy grails. In La Haie Fleurie \u2013 a honeysuckle jasmine that was so bounteously romantic it made your eyes water, Mr Ellena, as with First, painted with much thicker brushstrokes, yet still always preserved a certain elegant mystery, delving into his great love of jasmine (as a boy, he would actually gather and distil lroses and jasmine in the fields of Grasse \u2013 the man couldn\u2019t possibly have better credentials in this regard), so I was delighted to smell his jasmine for Perris, which is FULL ON. A Total Flora. Jasmine, with jasmine, jasmine, and then more jasmine. Indolic, sunny, full, with just hints of clove and marigold/tagetes, Jasmin De Pays is a somewhat straight and linear soliflore (possibly too simple), that nevertheless has an air of summery triumphance. Similar in impression to Serge Lutens A La Nuit, that perfume feels slightly flat in comparison with Jasmin De Pays, which is more rounded : robust: and full of light. Like his other recent creation for Perris, Mimosa Triannon, which is a brisk and ethereal French country side road take on mimosa wedded gently with rose and hawthorn (with some nods to the strange coolness of Mimosa Pour Moi), but fluffier; less melancholy, quite poetic, I need to go back and give some of these a proper blast.\nA wonderful read, Neil. Everything, as ever, vividly described. I was enjoying all the descriptions, nodding my head mentally, enthused about this label, and then, that line: \u201d... a brisk and ethereal French country side road take on mimosa wedded gently with rose and hawthorn (with some nods to the strange coolness of Mimosa Pour Moi), but fluffier; less melancholy, quite poetic... \u201d Egads. I want this one. For some reason, hawthorn drives me crazy in the same way \u2014 not in the same way: to the same degree, I mean \u2014 as oakmoss. It adds backbone to everything. Mystery. Something melancholic. Some elegance. I must get my hands on this Mimosa Tanneron you speak of.\nI liked it : I really love mimosa, and the one definitely has credibility, but I need to smell it again. There was something \u2013 a lack of sweetness? that perturbed me.\nOh, and I was reading up on Nosy Be and Madagascar in general. Good Lord. Why does the whole world feel unsafe to me these days?!\nNo desire for travel whatsoever.\nI went on an Ylang Ylang quest last year and found a few good ones: Giselle by Carla Fracci, Ylang In gold by M. Micallef (on the sweet side though), Cornaline by Anatole Lebreton, Ylang by Lorenzo Villoresi (powdery) but the one that ended my endless blind buying was Tasneem by La Via del Profumo. The longevity is poor but THAT is the Ylang note I was looking for, the one closest to the smell of my old bottle of EO.\nI agree on the PMC Ylang Nosy Be: too green and aquatic, something like wet cardboard at some point even. The drydown is great but the road to get there is too hard for me.\nYes: I know you are Ylang Ylang Queen so presumed you knew and didn\u2019t much care for this one. The Micaleff is too\u2026.\u2019much\u2019 for me and Anatole is always odd somehow. Agree about the drydown of Nosy Be but there is a salted quality I am not happy with.\nI am curious about the Villoresi \u2013 he does powdery very well. What is the Giselle like?\nLoving the sound of the Tasneem.\nIt\u2019s hard to find a real ylang-ylang solinote, or a dominant ylang-ylang perfume.\nMost often it serves a huge support role for the other floral notes. (Let say, the beginning of the extrait of Samsara and Chamade by Guerlain, among a thousand others).\nSince somewhat 8 years, there must be also a new synthetic replacement. It\u2019s a tiresome one. Because perfumes that I used to like, now bug me in the new bottle in store : no22 from Chanel, Lyric from Amouage. It\u2019s the one in Vanille galante from Herm\u00e8s too. It\u2019s hard to describe, it smell more of flower -ground wheat-, but with a sickening effect, to my mind.\n\u2013 old diorissimo, even edt (or Pleasure intense from Lauder after 15mn on fabric). It gives nothing at first, like snow on a black cathodic screen, then the blur is lifted and then it\u2019s a snowy rose, veiled in white by the ylang-ylang and aldehyde.\n\u2013 Eau moh\u00e9li from Diptyque. It\u2019s paired with ginger. The same for L\u2019occitane\u2019s 5 oils repairing SHAMPOO (the one with the pink label) : spicy true ylang-ylang. It\u2019s my cheap thrill.\nAs a side note, Loulou from Cacharel is quite well-preserved, for a wide-distributed classic.\nAnd I never smelled Amaranthine -discontinued- by Penhaligon by Bertrand Duchaufour.\nClosest thing to ylang ylang perfection, imo, is Acqua di Parma Profumo, because of its pure beauty more than its dutiful mimicry of the note. It\u2019s one of my favourite fragrances. As you say, as a solo performer, it hasn\u2019t been given its due. Estee Lauder PC Amber Ylang Ylang is simple, rich, ylang-forward and good. I do love PG Ilang Ivohibe and now that I think of it, it\u2019s a beautiful sketch of the note. Chanel\u2019s ylang ylang notes are very good, of course, and I like your reference to No 5. I confess to not having really gone out of my way to explore ylang ylang in perfume as I have with things like rose and narcissus.\nIt\u2019s partly for me also because the essential oil is so cheap, comparatively, that I might unconsciously think of it as a \u2018lesser\u2019 flower.\nI never had much luck with Parfumerie Generale.\nHis florals are better than his woods and edgy stuff.\nI got my hand on an old \u201cProfumo\u201d from Acqua di parma. I did not think of ylang-ylang, but of yellow plum. It\u2019s actually credited to Fran\u00e7oise Caron on basenotes (and Francis Kurkdjian). I was surprised : this perfume holds its promises. It\u2019s a different sort of plum chypre.\n(Profumo means perfume in Italian. So I checked if there were an \u201cYlang-ylang\u201d one in their range. Their discontinued cologna assoluta is said to be sorely missed too, and to be containing ylang-ylang too. I never tried it.).\n(The \u201cmirabelle\u201d are a french obsession in the north-east. Mostly because you can make tarts and booze with these yellow plums. Because it grows in garden. And because one year out of five the harvest is sublime and sort of a miracle. The other four years it\u2019s shitty : worms because of the rain, or not made tanned and ripe enough by the sun, or 80% eaten by birds).\nFrancis Kurkdjian pulled a similar trick with ylang-ylang in \u201cEnl\u00e8vement au s\u00e9rail\u201d at MDCI -now discontinued-. That is, a twist around Femme de Rochas. I hope they will reissue it. Their bottle are expensive, but their trial offer gives very generous sample vials.\nI haven\u2019t been able to sample Tuberose Absolue but<|endoftext|>"

The eau de toilette was delivered in bulk to her at the Beverly Hills Hotel under a cloak and dagger alias while she filmed Some Like It Hot. Featuring notes of rose, geranium, citronella, and sandalwood, the British eau de toilette has been discontinued, and its scent is now only available as a bath essence.\nAlthough Kennedy wore several perfumes throughout her life, one of her favorites was the classic Joy by Jean Patou, known for years as the most expensive perfume in the world. For just one ounce of the heavily floral scent, more than 10,000 jasmine flowers and 28 dozen roses are required \u2014 a risky business decision, especially because the scent was created in 1929 at the start of the Great Depression. But the aura of uber-luxury and prestige worked: Joy went on to become one of the most successful fragrances of all time, and it was voted Scent of the Century in 2000 at the Fragrance Foundation's FiFi Awards.\nWhen Grace Kelly became Her Serene Highness Princess Grace of Monaco in 1956, she walked down the aisle of Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame-Immacul\u00e9e (in front of guests including Cary Grant and Ava Gardner!) wearing Creed Fleurissimo. The fragrance, from the esteemed family-owned fragrance house, was commissioned specially by Prince Rainier for his bride to complement her wedding bouquet. It contains notes of bergamot, tuberose, Florentine iris, and Bulgarian rose.\nNowadays, every boldface name has her own fragrance line \u2014 but Elizabeth Taylor was a pioneer when she launched her revolutionary perfume empire, including blockbuster scents such as White Diamonds, Forever, and Passion. (To this day, White Diamonds remains the bestselling celebrity fragrance of all time.) In earlier days, however, Taylor wore Jean Desprez Bal \u00e0 Versailles, an oriental scent created in 1962 with notes of rosemary, orange blossom, sandalwood, and vanilla. She wore it on the set of Cleopatra and even gifted the scent to Michael Jackson, who wore it for the rest of his life.\nAn eternal fan of the delicate, romantic gardenia flower (there's even a gardenia on her gravestone), Natalie Wood wore Jungle Gardenia, which was first given to her by Old Hollywood star Barbara Stanwyck while filming The Bride Wore Boots in 1946. Known as \"the most exotic fragrance in the world,\" the original juice contained notes of bitter orange, tuberose, and heliotrope and was famously reimagined \u2014 as an unsuccessful flop \u2014 by Coty in the '90s. This year, her daughter Natasha Gregson Wagner released a modern gardenia-laced fragrance in her mother's honor called, simply, Natalie.\nA more modern but no less indelible icon, Princess Diana walked down the aisle at St. Paul's Cathedral bathed in Quelques Fleurs, a floral scent featuring notes of tuberose, rose, and jasmine. (Rumors abound that she accidentally spilled the juice on her wedding dress while trying to top up just before getting out of the carriage.) Later in life, Princess Diana was a fan of 24 Faubourg by Herm\u00e8s, created in 1995 by perfumer Maurice Roucel and named for the address of the Herm\u00e8s flagship store in Paris. A sunny scent, it contains notes of orange blossom, peach, gardenia, and amber.\nThe first black woman to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress, Dorothy Dandridge wore Tabu by Dana, a sexy fragrance that was supposedly created by perfumer Jean Carles with the risqu\u00e9 instructions to make a scent that a prostitute would wear. (Its tagline was \"Tabu \u2014 the forbidden fragrance.\") Notes include bergamot, clover, oriental rose, amber, moss, musk, patchouli, sandalwood, and vetiver.\nAva Gardner was reportedly partial to Creed Fleurs de The Rose Bulgare, a rose scent with bergamot and green tea notes. Other scents favored by the Best Actress nominee included Guerlain Mitsouko and the bergamot, mandarin, and lilac-infused Fracas by Robert Piguet. While she was married to Frank Sinatra, stories circulated that she'd signal an end to one of their regular, titanic fights by spritzing the stairway with perfume as an invitation.\nMade specially for Audrey Hepburn by Hubert de Givenchy, L'Interdit \u2014 which means \"forbidden\" in French \u2014 was created in 1957. Rumors spread that Hepburn didn't want Givenchy to release the scent, but it was ultimately made available for wide purchase in the 1960s. A floral aldehyde, L'Interdit's notes include bergamot, rose, jasmine, iris, violet, narcissus, and sandalwood. In later years, Hepburn wore Creed Spring Flower, another scent created just for her.\nAviation enthusiast Kate Hepburn was a fan of Jacques Guerlain's 1933 scent Vol de Nuit, which was created in homage to the Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry book Night Flight. (The same author wrote the children's classic The Little Prince.) A woodsy and spicy floral, its notes included bergamot, jasmine, and vanilla, and the bottle displays a relief of a moving airplane propeller.\nOften photographed spritzing on perfume, Rita Hayworth was a fan of the blockbuster 1925 oriental fragrance Guerlain Shalimar \u2014 which was rumored to have been created when Jacques Guerlain dumped vanillin into a bottle of the celebrated foug\u00e8re scent Jicky as an experiment \u2014 and Lanvin Arpege, a sensual aldehydic floral.\nA world-famous American in Paris \u2014 as well-known for what she was wearing (a skirt made from bananas) as what she wasn't (clothing) \u2014 Josephine Baker liked to spritz herself in Guerlain Sous Le Vent. Created specially for her in 1934 by Jacques Guerlain, the scent fit the era's chypre trend, including oakmoss, dried tobacco leaves, basil, tarragon, and galbanum resin.\nThe sultry half of one of Hollywood's greatest love stories was a fan of French luxury perfume house Diptyque Paris, wearing its blackcurrant and Bulgarian rose-scented L'Ombre Dans L'Eau and Opone (a woody Chypre featuring saffron, cumin, leather, and smoke).\nWhen Clark Gable first met the real-life Scarlett O'Hara before filming Gone With the Wind, he is said to have noticed that she smelled like violets. However, like many starlets of the era, including Olivia de Havilland, Mary Pickford, and Gloria Swanson, the British actress was a well-documented devotee of Joy by Jean Patou.<|endoftext|>"

All this at a very reasonable price. Any oils can be used with it - our favourites are from Tisserand, robustly scented essential oils at a fair price.\nWho says aromatherapy must be restricted to your home? This travel diffuser is perfect for creating calm atmospheres wherever you go.\nThe Travel Diffuser from This Works comes in a nifty pouch, which includes all you need to set up a piece of peace within your hotel room.\nThe USB power cable can connect to any power device, and unlike others we tested, the diffuser does not require water.\nIt comes with absorbent pads which you add a few drops of the oil to, making it even more hassle free to install. The accompanying Love Sleep Bedroom Blend oil is a 100% natural mix of ylang ylang, patchouli and frankincense, which smells like a warm hug.\nScientifically designed to help de-stress, promote good sleep and even encourage intimacy, this oil ensures your hotel room is a home away from home.\nWhile we love the indulgent aroma of this oil, this compact diffuser can be used with other oils too.\nBoth USB and battery powered, the Aromaworks Aroma Diffuser can be used in the comfort of your own home or on the go for a peaceful atmosphere.\nThe design is an oval shape but is compact enough to fit into any space within your home. Similar to the other travel diffusers we tested, this diffuser works with an absorbent pad rather than water, so takes a little longer to infuse its surroundings.\nIt also features a multi-coloured soft mood lighting which meant it complemented any room or mood we found ourselves in.\nWhile this diffuser does not have multiple time settings, it comes with two essential oils which makes it brilliant value. The petitgrain and lavender oil left us feeling truly relaxed while the lemongrass and bergamot oil invigorated our senses.\nLovers of Diptyque fragrances and candles are rightly devoted to the French perfume house, and will undoubtedly adore this electric plug diffuser, which releases the scent of Diptyque\u2019s signature fragrances gently across the room.\nThis plug-in is pricy, but has great throw, and we found within minutes of deployment our living room was sumptuous with the scent of our favourite Diptyque scent, Baies - delicious rose and blackcurrant.\nThere are no aromatherapy claims to be made here, but if you want your house to smell great, nothing will do the job more thoroughly or quickly. Be warned, though: the diffuser comes without any cartridges, so you have to buy them to go worth it. If you\u2019re serious about room scents, its well worth it.\nStylish, high-performing, and reasonably priced, the Marks and Spencer diffuser is an excellent option for a touch of class in your living room.\nThis silent diffuser provides a fine, steady mist for up to eight hours, and will switch off automatically when it has finished refreshing a room. Much better looking than the price tag would suggest, it lights up via LED in the dark to add warmth to the atmosphere.\nWhile the Marks & Spencer diffuser can be used with any essential oils, this gift set comes with their highly-popular Calm scent, a proprietary mix of cedarwood, bergamot, and lavender, that is especially soothing. We were impressed with this reliable choice.<|endoftext|>"

Both of us love the Hinoki Shower Gel. It has a really potent unique scent that lingers after the shower. We\u2019ve gone through several of the full size which I need to repurchase again. This particular set has four 2.5 oz sizes of the Shampoo, Conditioner, Shower Gel and Body Lotion.\nThe Malin + Goetz Jumbo Rum Body Wash came at a perfect time for me. I discovered it during our stay in Miami and fell in love with it. It has a gentle feel to it but has a really delicious dark rum scent. I usually gravitate towards body cleansers that have a little more strength in terms of cleansing. This one is gentle and works best if I lather with a wash cloth. I\u2019m obsessed with the scent though and it does leave the skin soft. It\u2019s 32 oz and comes with a pump. Win win for me.\nThe beautyblender blend.cleanse.carry Set has two pink beautyblenders, a mini solid cleanser and a carrying case. I was really excited about it but have to admit I was hoping it would be a hard storage case instead of a soft silicone case. This was my fault though as I did not read the online description and in store I didn\u2019t take the time to touch it. The price cannot be beat though and I\u2019m excited to put the case to the test.\nGlamglow is always a go-to for me. I was tempted to stock up for myself but decided to stick with what I have and repurchase items I use up later. I did buy the Glamglow The Clear Skin Set for my brother. It\u2019s a $96 value but for the sale it\u2019s priced at $59 for a full size SUPERCLEANSE Clearing Cream to Foam Cleanser, SUPERMUD Clearing Mask (the best in my opinion) and a mini Matte Glow Moisturizer. I also bought the Glamglow x Becca We Know Glow Duo which just launched online. I have not had a chance to try this yet but did hand swatch the powder which applies like a warm gold color on the skin. I hope this comes out in a full size eventually. The pink gravity mud appears to be the same as the current silver version in the purple tube, just a different color.\nThe Diptyque Floral Candle & Eau de Toilette Set is a beautiful set with three mini candles in Baies, Roses and Tubereuse. It has the three matching spritzer perfumes in mini sizes which are perfect for me to carry around in my purse. I had been eyeing Do Son for months now although it\u2019s more of a fall scent to me so I\u2019m trying to wait before buying. The mini will get me by for now. It also has Eau Rose and L\u2019Ombre Dans L\u2019eau (also better for fall).\nLast but not least is the Jo Malone Travel Candle Collection which has three 2.1 oz travel candles of Lime Basil and Mandarin, English Pear and Freesia and Peony and Blush Suede. This was an impulse buy for me. The only one I truly love is the Lime Basil scent so I might end up exchanging this for a couple of the full size candles or one of their hand washes instead.\nThat wraps up my beauty sets hauls for the skin, hair and home! I will have upcoming reviews on the Hourglass Ambient Lighting Blush Palette, three MAC Sets, YSL Volupt\u00e9 Tint-in-Balm Kiss Set and the Tom Ford Iris Bronze Set (I\u2019ve found some dupes).\nTo recap the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale runs through August 5th.

When Barneys started carrying the bell jars (I think it was in mid-2013), I reserved one for purchase during a Beauty Bag Event. Of course, I also realized then that the mark up was huge as compared to the price at the Paris boutique; however, it was worth it as a plane ticket was way more than the mark-up.\nAh-mazing perfume math for ISM.\np.s. would love to see your list of LT 1 stars.\nI have nothing by Roucel. (Where did my bottle of Tocade go?) Testing Stella and Infusion d\u2019Amande today. I find Stella plain unintersting, but IdA is truly delicious, and it lasts!\nMaybe it swam off, during the thunderstorm!\nPossibly, lol,\u2026 We are having another one right now, maybe even bigger. Wearing a dab of Rumba to match.\nSOTD: 24 Faubourg.\nBeautiful sunshine in a bottle.\nI was searching through my samples, but could not find anything by Roucel. I did find a sample of Sous Le Vent I forgot I had, so that is what I went with today. I loved the beginning, but I can hardly smell it 3 hours later\u2026it is very light, a skin scent now\u2026darn my scent eating skin.\nAs I have nary a one, am in Bendelirious instead.\nOh, Bendelirious is a fun scent. I have a decant in my office desk as an emergency pick-me-up in case I forget perfume in the morning. Good pick for a Friday SOTD!\nI reviewed the list of scents by Mr. Roucel and sadly I have none of them. There are some I\u2019d like to try, but not many stuck out as ones I feel I\u2019m missing.\nI went with comfort today, wearing the spicy, warm, vanilla, Voyage by Hiram Green. The dry down on this is heavenly.\nI love Voyage. I am a little nervous wearing it now, though, as I was accosted by our mail woman a month or so ago because of it. I was waiting in the foyer of our small building for her to finish putting the mail in our boxes, as there was a package at her feet for me that I needed to get. She abruptly turned, opened the door of the building, and told me I needed to leave because my perfume was \u201cjust too much.\u201d I explained that I was standing there for a reason, waiting to get a package out of the box at her feet. She then kicked it over to me, still holding the door open and gesturing for me to leave. I was assured by others just after that I smelled great and my perfume was not too strong, but boy, it jolted me.\nShould I add that it was pouring down rain outside? So there were all sorts of reasons I might have been waiting in the foyer to my own apartment before going out. On the other hand, she has to work there and it is a public and enclosed space. Ah well.\nShe needs a lesson in manners for sure! I was brought up to believe it\u2019s quite rude and unacceptable to criticize other\u2019s choices, regardless if its an outfit, makeup, scent, spouse, ad infinitum. This is why I avoid A LOT of people and hang out with my dog. I\u2019m quite sure you smelled fabulous and hope there was a nice treat in that box that you patiently, kindly, and politely waited for.\nI am sure it was perfume, although why I would have felt the need to have it right away is beyond me. Your dog sounds much nicer than many people I know, and more entertaining!\nHa! That is for sure.\nWow, she literally went postal!\nI know right? I almost felt lucky getting out of the building with only a scolding!\nVoyage is a good one. \nAnd wearing Diptyque Essences Insensees 2015 which is a winning combination.\nFriday at last!!!\nI bemoan the fact that FF is gone But I use the Godiva shampoo bar now for hair and body. It\u2019s a nice jasmine bomb.\nWhat, it\u2019s discontinued?!?! I was planning to buy Flying Fox shower gel after I ran out of Rose Jam. Darn.\nIt was always going to be Iris Silver Mist, and it is. It\u2019s probably the most intriguing of all the Lutens(es) and the most daring iris there is.\nI even got complimented on it by a colleague.\nI tried Kenzo Air years ago, and enjoyed it a lot, but never got any. More\u2019s the pity.\nOh, I\u2019ve only now seen that we are twins! Lovely.\nSOTD is K de Krizia, my signature scent back when I used to have signature scents ;-). Great memories and I\u2019m loving its lasting power!\nYay! I\u2019ve been scrolling to find another K de Krizia wearer. I thought I was going to be all alone I only discovered it last year but I really do love it.\nI almost wore K de Krizia. I have a lovely vintage bottle that I use sparingly\u2026 I\u2019m wearing Dans Tes Bras instead.\nI think you sent me my mini! I wore it yesterday \u2013 great stuff.\nI think I did! Glad you like it.\nKicking myself for not saving some from back in the day. Can\u2019t bear to try a newer bottle bc I know I\u2019ll be disappointed.\nI must have used my bottle up, as I couldn\u2019t find it today. Fortunately I have several vintage minis.\nI think I have a vintage mini of this, as yet untried!\nI used to have Tocade but threw it away quite a long time ago in a fit of decluttering. My remaining Roucel choices are Reflection, MR, 24 Faubourg, or Oro. None of them are really calling to me this morning, but Oro is light and doesn\u2019t last long (I really cannot do Reflection at all, I only have it as part of a set) so Oro it is. Tomorrow for the Splitmeet I\u2019m listing Salome, I hope there are other people that want some.\nScent twins! But that\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen Oro described as \u201clight,\u201d and it lasts a solid 24 hours on me. And I am getting very excited about the Splitmeet.\nISM today, since it\u2019s the only one I\u2019ve got even though it\u2019s a decant. Someday I will be able to get a full bottle.\nI don\u2019t think I have anything of Roucel but I\u2019m saving myself for the mail. I ended up using the Aedes sample service to get a sample of Un Lys (hopefully it won\u2019t get subbed out, that would be quite unfortunate\u2026) and it\u2019s getting delivered today. So I won\u2019t have to ruin the integrity of my sealed bottle of Un Lys just in case it\u2019s not for me. And hopefully some of the other samples that are coming are fun too.\nUn Lys is so gorgeous. I hope it works for you. Really great in Spring.\nL de Lolita Lempicka today. I strongly associate this one with summer and the beach- possibly impressed upon me by the mermaidesque bottle or the salted caramel and citrus smells. I\u2019m enjoying it and wishing it were summer.\nI do like it best in summer, in fact.\nI got a mini of this the other day. Will try it out tonight.\nI forgot my Iris Silver Mist at home, but I\u2019m totally going to take it out once I get back. I thought I had a lot more scents by Roucel, but turns out it\u2019s only ISM that remains in my collection. I guess the others were decants that I\u2019ve finished, I\u2019m sure I used to have Tocade and 24 Faubourg. I\u2019m a bit surprised by this \u2013 his name always comes up when I think or talk about favourite or most admired perfumers and I only have one full bottle from his whole list!\nI\u2019ve got a FB of Iris Poudre and decants or samples of a number of Roucel\u2019s, but decided to go for one as yet unmentioned \u2014 and totally forgotten by me \u2014 Jasmine 17. It\u2019s very nice as it turns out. There *is* jasmine, so unlike some Le Lebos the name isn\u2019t completely deceptive, but there are other things quietly happening too. Maybe some neroli or bergamot at the top; sandalwood for sure. The sample I\u2019m wearing is the perfume oil, which likely makes a difference.\nI also have to eat my words from yesterday. I wrote in one thread that I didn\u2019t love Mohur, but then I decided to try it again last night and I found myself wondering why one would ever wear anything else. It\u2019s beautiful and spicy and warm, with a clear true rose appearing here and there in a wonderful way. I can only imagine how good the extract is! I still love Pichola, but I now want bottles of both. Oh dear...\nOops. Iris Pourdre isn\u2019t a Roucel, is it? I was thinking of Dan Tes Bras, of which I have a small decant and don\u2019<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "\u201cMy mum told me the big red one from Wilko is the best in the world,\u201d my boyfriend told me, our second week of going out. I entered his room (third date rule, you know) and a waft of warm winter spice took over, making me feel like I just inhaled three cinnamon sticks worth of powder. Was it a Glade room freshener or the bulky candle with \u201cWinter Wonderland\u201d written all over it? To say I was instantly turned off would be an overstatement, but this smell surely did influence the outcome of the night. Luckily, we got over this turmoil and we\u2019re still together, our relationship going almost two years strong. We now live together in a lovely flat in Clapton, with Byredo\u2019s Loose Lips in the middle of the dinner table, waiting for the next romantic dish to be lit up. The scent of luxury is seducing, even for a stingy Northener like Ryan. Don\u2019t worry though, we\u2019ve still got a whole six pack of \u00a32.99 Wilko candles tucked under our sink, waiting for some rainier days.\nAdd \u00a310 to that one and you\u2019ve got yourself a Yankee Candle, the American brand taking almost half of the whole candle market. With their focus on expanding the range into all directions, they have seemingly created a candle for every season, place or mood. Belgian Waffles? Check. Fluffly Towels? Check. You can even personalise one with an image and a special name, perfect for the next Mother\u2019s or Valentine\u2019s day.\nClimbing on the price point ladder, the offering seems to be growing without stopping in sight. Reflecting the world of luxury expanding into mainstream, candles seem to be doing the same. As reported by Business of Fashion at the end of last year, \u201cthe market of prestige candles totalled in $101.9 million in the US in the 12 months ending September 2018,\u201d marking a jump of one-third in the last two years. It looks like Ryan and I aren\u2019t alone in burning our money. Where does this big new obsession come from? Perhaps the candles mark a shopper\u2019s first step of buying into a luxury lifestyle, as fashion-approved furniture continues its popularity in place of (or in addition to) designer bags.\nThe brand that arguably kicked it all off was Diptyque, a Paris-based perfumery that began as a textile company back in the 1950s. In 1963, they launched their first range of scented candles and the world never looked back. With over 50 different variations in their collection, they have since become synonymous with the smell of luxury, every (other) store on Old Bond Street smelling of Figuier, a fan-favourite scent. Both Theresa May and Beyonc\u00e9 have Diptyque candles on their rider \u2013 I do indeed hope they aren\u2019t the same ones, for the sake of the world\u2019s wellbeing. The latest additions to their wide range are Lily and Narguile, imagined as a duo of candles that can be enjoyed both separately and together, creating the mood of an Eastern garden at dusk.\nPredating Diptyque for a few centuries, the world\u2019s oldest candlemaker still active today Cire Trudon goes all the way back to the 1643 when the idea of candles was a necessity rather than a luxury. However, it was the Louis XV that got \u201cseduced by their perfectly white candles,\u201d and therefore contributed to the popularity of their Manufacture at rue Saint Honor\u00e9 in Paris. They expanded into candle art, forming sculptures and providing royals with all their imperial necessities. It wasn\u2019t until 2007 that Cire Trudon began its scented journey, coming on the back of a big wave of fragrance houses dipping (get it?) into the luxe candle market. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle as well as the launches of Le Labo and Byredo \u2013 all perfumeries which have today become equally respected for their candles and their fragrances. Skincare brands Malin + Goetz and Sisley also joined in, extending their beauty range into an experience. You can totally imagine yourself putting on a face mask in the bath, with the new Leather candle from M+G burning in the background. All of these brands have been consistently growing their candle ranges. Collaborating with Mother of MUAs Pat McGrath on the launch of her own brand in UK, Byredo created a limited edition of 200 glass jars of their lipstick-scented Loose Lips. The latest from Le Labo is Verveine 32, their take on a citrus-infused herbal tea, while Malle launched Country Home and Mahogany, their rich perfumed wax set in matte porcelain jars which resemble artisanal pottery that could be seen down on Columbia Road Market.\nThough some may argue it\u2019s all about the scent, most of these brands developed a recognisable visual language that portrays their candle as a design object. Byredo\u2019s black and white contrast, Diptyque\u2019s scattered letters and Cire Trudon\u2019s shiny gold label. Some have gone even further, playing up this notion of using candles as home accessories. Design brand Tom Dixon are equally focusing on the looks as they do on what\u2019s inside, creating jars in a variety of shapes, colours and materials, from glass to metal and stone. Inspired by the work of late Italian artist Piero Fornasetti and led by his daughter Barbara, the design brand Fornasetti is topping the price chart of luxe candles. Their ceramic jars are printed in the painter\u2019s works and come with a matching lid, making the packaging desirable even after the light goes out.\nComing late to the candle-lit dinner are the<|endoftext|>"

No one-size-fits-all mentality goes into making them. They are voyages of love for the perfumer and voyages of imagination for the wearer. So why not take a trip?\n A summery blend of gardenia, jasmine and tuberose, cucumber and citrus. Kai is so light and alluring. An absolute summer classic.\nImagine walking through a tropical rain forest where ylang ylang grows wild, like the lush woods of the Dominican Republic (home of the best ylang ylang in the world). That\u2019s where Le Labo\u2019s new Ylang 49, 50ml edp,$198, will take you. Moist and mossy, with that divine ylang ylang scent.\nFruity perfumes really come into their own over the summer and one you must try is Byredo Pulp, 50ml edp, $158 \u2013 a tropical cocktail of bergamot, grapefruit, blackcurrant apple and fig. Like a punch cocktail, you could be overlooking a sparkling beach anywhere in the world.\nMelon is the key ingredient in Frederic Malle\u2019s Le Parfum de Therese, 50ml edp, $209, a complex fragrance for women including mandarin, rose, violet and plum.\nMy grandmother had enormous fig trees at her farm in Lightning Ridge, NSW. When the fruit dropped and split on the ground the scent of fig was palpable\u2026 warm, sunny, sweet and sensual, Diptyque\u2019s Philosykos, 100ml edt, $148, takes me there.\nOne of the most gorgeous scents to wear in hot weather has to be Comme des Gar\u00e7ons Play Green, 100ml edt, $145. If you imagine walking bare foot in the morning through a mint patch, you get the idea. Refreshing, uplifting clean and green. It includes lime, juniperberry (gin), jasmine, basil and cedarwood. Just amazing.\nVoyage to the citrus groves of southern Italy, with Frederic Malle\u2019s Cologne Bigarade, 100ml edp, $194. Bigarade is bitter orange. In the perfume, its mixed with rose, cardamom, pepper and cedarwood. A fresh scent for women and men.\nFor citrus, try Maison Francis Kurkdjian Aqua Vitae 70ml edt, $194.

        "step": 27995,
        "passage": "ela\u2019s By The Fireplace. I mean, c\u2019mon\u2014the clue is in the name. It smells so cozy: a blend of sweet toasted marshmallow and smoky, burning wood. It also has some of the best lasting power I\u2019ve found in a fragrance. This is a great \u201cstaying home\u201d fragrance.\nOn a similar, though less edible, vibe is Diptyque\u2019s Eau Duelle. It definitely has a vanilla note, but also offers a slightly incense-y, perfume-like aroma. Like a delicious, sexy church, if you will.\nSpeaking of sexy churches, Comme des Garcons makes an amazing collection of religion-based wood fragrances. Sounds weird (although, quite frankly, what do you expect from CdG?), smells incredible. The best two are Incense Kyoto and Incense Avignon, based on Shintoism and Catholicism, respectively. Both are truly fantastic options if you like a wood-based scent. The former is more fresh, the latter more smoky\u2014but both are undeniably warm, cozy, and wintery.\nA classic when it comes to cold weather fragrances is Chanel No. 5. It\u2019s kind of vintage-smelling, but in a really, really good way. If you want to smell like a femme fatale in an old movie, or a super-cool grandma who has the best and most outrageous stories, this is the one for you. It\u2019s undeniably classy, but somehow never boring.\nIt\u2019s also expensive, and if that price tag is simply out of your budget, I point you in the direction of Coty\u2019s L\u2019Aimant. Coming from a brand which is so markedly uncool, this fragrance is shockingly lovely. It has the same vibe as Chanel No. 5 without trying too hard to be a dupe, giving you that sense of sophistication, even if your bank balance begs to differ.\nI\u2019m also extremely partial to a winter musk. There\u2019s something both icy and cozy about a musky note\u2014like snuggling under a furry blanket while riding in a sleigh. The best musk out there is Serge Lutens Clair de Musc. Where traditional musks can stray into \u201cdirty animal\u201d territory (seriously\u2014look it up!), this remains light and sparkly. The quality, like with any Serge Lutens fragrance, is second to none.\nIt\u2019s definitely a treat though, so if you want a similar vibe, I absolutely love Jovan White Musk. It\u2019s a very simple scent, but for the price it most certainly gets the job done. And when that job is smelling nice, it\u2019s kind of important to do it right.\nIf you like the idea of musk but find the scents a little too sharp or harsh, then you may wish to consider Glossier\u2019s You. It has a hint of musk, but is also sweet and creamy. It\u2019s surprisingly subtle, and has a strangely metamorphic quality, giving each person a unique (but delightful) custom scent.\nAnother fragrance which smells different on everyone is Escentric Molecule\u2019s Molecule 01. There\u2019s a science to this scent which I\u2019m not going to pretend to understand\u2014but essentially, it\u2019s designed to combine with your own scent-producing pheromones to make everybody who smells you fall in love with you. Does it work? I mean, no. But it does smell seriously, moan-inducingly, annoyingly, and indescribably good.\nSometimes wintery scents can veer too far into cloying territory, so for those who prefer a sharper, fresher fragrance yet still want something appropriate to the cold weather, I\u2019m here for you, too. Clean Sel Santal is a fantastic choice\u2014it has a slightly sour, cucumber-y note which is honestly mouth-watering. If you like Le Labo Santal 33, you\u2019ll love this slightly more wearable sandalwood scent.\nAcross the board I love perfume brand Commodity, and they have some excellent fresh-but-wintery options, too. My top two picks are Wool and Bois. Wool is sweeter and softer, while Bois is a little sharper, but both offer a light and non-gourmand take on a winter perfume. I also find the longevity Commodity\u2019s products to be distinctly above average.\nHowever, if you do favor a scent that\u2019s good enough to eat, I have some truly delicious options. My top pick is the new Tom Ford offering, Lost Cherry. It has a candy-ish vibe thanks to the sweet and juicy cherry, but this slightly teenage vibe is countered by a smoky, dangerous base note. Cherries on fire, shall we say?\nUnfortunately, like all Tom Ford fragrances, it costs basically a million dollars ($320). If you want to approximate this cherry vibe, a great option is Cacharel\u2019s Yes I Am. It\u2019s very sweet and fruity, but with a creamy, slightly smoky base. The bottle of this option is also one of the best I\u2019ve ever seen\u2014a retro, plastic lipstick lookalike.\nA classic gourmand suitable for year-round wear (but most delicious in cold weather) is the original Lavanila Laboratories Pure Vanilla. I don\u2019t really need to explain this, except to say if you like to smell sweet and delicious, look no further. One of the best vanilla fragrances on the market, and, not to show off, but I consider myself a connoisseur.\nMy final recommendation is a little offbeat, but hear me out. Imaginary Authors is an independent brand which make scents inspired by works of literature, combining two of my greatest loves. They make a graphic novel-inspired scent called A City On Fire, and it offers the best \u201crecently burned match\u201d scent of your wildest dreams. While I don\u2019t tend to wear it alone (it\u2019s a little too on-the-nose in terms of a fire fragrance) it\u2019s absolutely perfect to layer up with sweeter fragrances to add a wintery twist. Combine with any gourmand to add a hint of sexy danger.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " it\u2019s on their imagination, not our actions.\nWould I buy it? Maybe not at this point in my life when I think I pretty much have Oud covered by about three other scents, if not more. But if I didn\u2019t I would be right there in line. Lasting power of the punchy opening isn\u2019t very long, but the warm spicy dry-down with the hint of roses and Oud last quite a long time. I would think that it is also fairly unisex; I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend it to a female friend. I recommended to my coworker that she run into the store and get the tuberose for herself and then send her husband in to get the Oud. Then steal it without compunction.\nOud Palao Eau de Parfum is I beleive anyplace that Diptyque is sold or online at their website. $150 for 2.5 ounces. My 1ML spray was a freebie from the store. Image is from Diptyque website.\nI am unfamiliar with most of this line, but I do love Philosykos!\nDiptyque deserves more love! I actually adore plenty about Diptyque (I was born their founding year as well), and their extremely generous sampling/GWP programs is just the start. I always have a few of their candles about, plus all their other home fragrance options are very appealing, well-scented and long-lasting and the best house gifts ever.\nOn the perfume front, Eau Duelle is my favorite dry vanilla, and Philosykos the wonderful green fig which takes me right back to my San Francisco days. I\u2019m particularly enjoying the limited edition Essences Incensees Jasmin EDP from a couple of years ago, and dying to try the well-reviewed Kionanthe and Benjoin Boheme.\nSo I guess you\u2019d call me a fan. In LA, I find the Larchmont boutique the most welcoming and generous (often gifted 5 &10ML sprays and small candles per visit) but Nordstrom SAs can be good too.\nI love Diptyque candles, even though I don\u2019t use candles often (they HOIT my sinuses). But I love their body cream, though I have screeched about the jar design (it\u2019s a disaster waiting to happen, with the weird little indentation at Precisely the WRONG place so if you have even remotely damp hands it slips out and can break a toe \u2013 or an entire foot! But omg. It is divine in smell and feel!\nDiptyque is also below my radar, I don\u2019t know why but none of the descriptions of their scents have made me think, wow, I have to run out and try that! But I wanted to add that I just read Rebecca over the holidays so I got your Manderley reference, yay!\nOud Palao reads to my nose as an airy and \u201cfresh\u201d Oud perfume, where the freshness comes from some greenery that complements the woody and smoky notes. Love it on my husband! I appreciate the fact that it has something different to say than the plethora of ouds on the market, and that it manages to have a comfy, delectably sweet appeal despite the notes and the attitude.\nBut I must admit, the Diptyque visuals just kill me. I would like my home to look like one of their shops.\nAnd if anybody wants to join me in an appeal to bring back rosa viola (cherry on top, an amazingly fun packaging)\u2026 I am not even a rose person!!!!<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " I know I gave it what appears to be a scathing review earlier in this thread, and it is a challenging smell (for me), but it's also distinct and evocative and feels like a very specific memory of mine involving patches of snow on the ground. I will also continue to wear Tom Ford Oud Wood when I'm actually not trying to repel people.\nnick wrote: Any ideas to fall frags that are slightly eccentric yet wholly accessible - and decidedly masculine? Enjoy the idea of niche fragrances but don't dig the whole Unisex thing. I like the presence fruity/floral notes but done in a way that does not come off as wearing womens perfume. Dior Homme does this well but I'm looking for something a bit different.\n\"Decidedly masculine\" is difficult to pin down, and (imo) only works with scents like Dior's Eau Sauvage or other unmistakably testosterone-y scents (although I knew a girl who wore ES and it was perfect - I don't much care for \"genders\" in fragrance, particularly as what gets marketed towards whom has been pretty variable over time). I am very drawn to florals, and (last time I checked) am relatively masculine (most of my fragrances are some type of pretty flower).\nHave you tried Serge Lutens? I find most of them fairly \"clean,\" including the florals. De Profundis (chrysanthemum) and Sarassins (Jasmine) are excellent florals (I also like Tuberose Criminelle, but it is more...adventurous); Chergui and Ambre Sultan (one of my favorites) offer more masculine options (although another female friend had settled on Chergui). Ambre Sultan is one of my favorites - I find amber perfect for fall and winter (Ambre Russe is also very nice, but people may think you're drunk).\nChanel's Coromandel is also a favorite of mine, which I think of as a spring scent but most others seem to find autumnal. I find it very sensual, and when worn by a man, nicely surprising. I get a lot of patchouli and white chocolate out of it, but I find that the whole thing has a delectable rot to it that I associate with e.e. cummings, driftwood, beaches, and sex - but you might link to decaying leaves. This may be less accessible, but is truly a stunner.\nWhat has to be one of the best buys in the whole game is a fragrance called \"Midnight in Paris\" by Van Cleef and Arpels. It's a lily scent, and smells...well, just like the title suggests. Moonlit flowers, a bit chilly, with the warmth of a leather glove - a scarf wrapped around its neck and, just maybe, slightly wobbly after dark. It's often on Amazon for really cheap, and even at retail is a steal. I wear it all the time, and it is really (I think) a beautifully balanced, masculine fragrance. That and Chergui are very accessible; for the others feel free to procure samples as you dare.\nOh, and since they've been mentioned; my favorite of the CDGS3I (whew) scents is Ouarzazate: dry bones, scoured by desert winds, as seen from altitude - and later thought about, with some melancholy, at a teahouse. Also good for fall.\nThanks for the great reply @synthese. By \"decidedly masculine\" I don't mind abundantly so, I just mean that it smells like a fragrance targeted at men - even if it could even work well on women too.\nI'll search out samples of some of your suggestions - though it seems \"Midnight in Paris\" is at the blind buy level of affordability.\nSo since my clothes are more or less stable I've been getting into fragrances. \nI tried a few things from the fragrance guide on MFA, and (since it's autumn) ordered a sampler of autumn scents. So far I like, in roughly descending order: Green Irish Tweed by Creed (but doesn't everyone), L'instant de Guerlain pour Homme, Chergui by Serge Lutens, Thallium by Yves de Sistelle, Burberry Touch, and Bvlgari Pour Homme Soir. The only one I've tried that I really didn't care for was Nautica Voyage.\nMy nose isn't very sensitive, so I have a lot of trouble discerning more than \"I like this\" or \"I don't like this\", and the biggest deciding factor is whether or not my wife likes something.\nMy big point of confusion with fragrances is that I don't really see what makes different categories distinct. Like, what makes something better for daytime or evening, what's best for one season over another, why is this set of things that sound like they smell nice considered feminine rather than masculine. All of the ones I listed above except for GIT and Chergui are from the autumn sampler I got, and the Chergui definitely seems similar to them. But I don't know what makes them autumnal.\nI feel like I could probably happily just wear GIT all year round but, I dunno, it seems too safe? I dress pretty conservatively but I try to put out some weirdness within the constraints of the trad/prep look (I think germinal once described me as \"an eccentric professor\"). I'd like to find fragrances along the same lines but I don't speak the language at all and I don't even know where to look to start learning.\nAs am I, I use a rather cheapish Green Tea scent at the moment, and the description of the Margiela perfume sounds like it should smell reasonably close to Genmaicha!\nwhy do some scents (seemingly) only come in EDT? Why not EDP too? I'm looking at BLACK by comme des garcons. I got a sample of the EDT and I really dig it but it doesn't seem like it lasts very long.\ncurrently alternating between diptyque tam dao and maison louis marie no.4.\nthat @synthese fella sold me on Midnight in Paris - got a bottle of the stuff for $23 off a fragrance group on FB - $23!!!\ntotally worth it but don't really get much out of it rather than vanilla. there's a little bit of a chemical/rubbery smell (dont know what you call this?) when u first apply it, which is kinda cool, but that fades, which is also kinda cool. vanilla is lovely and somehow it still does come off as a mens fragrance (tho would work on women too I reckon) so I'll be wearing it a lot.\nstill on the lookout for something piney/incensey though perhaps not as ridiculous as CDG zagorsk.\nAnyone have experience with Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab?\nThey had a booth at the last comic convention I went to, but don't remember any of the scents and they have so many, so I don't know what's good to try...\nfrom what I can gather (and some personal experience fueled by curiousity!) those etsy-core perfume oil based fragrances just kind of smell like a hodgepodge of cheap head-shop incenses. no thanks - but maybe BPAL is better due to their ubiquity - though I wouldn't bank on it.\nif you're on a budget and down to experiment, my recommendation is picking up decants/splits from forums and social media groups. great way to try stuff out / have fun w/ it without leaving burning holes in your pockets.\ngot 2 5ml mini flacons of scents from goest,'silent films' and'realism'. at $34 USD these may be a bit pricey but they pack a huge punch even with the slightest drop!\nrealism is really floral and earthy, then mellows out with the same feel. if you like the smell of rain and crushed leaves, then this is pretty much perfect! feels pretty much like a day scent to me but could be funky fresh for the night.\n- Estee Lauder just announced that they are acquiring Le Labo. hope this doesn't spell bad things...\n- on a more positive Le Labo note, I'm enjoying how Rose 31 changes on my skin and becomes fuller, muskier, and less plasticky in the cool air, and how the citrus of Bergamote 22 suddenly becomes too crisp somehow against the chill. probably some of this is conditioning (citrus for summer!!) but I can also definitely smell a difference, too.\n- I got a sample of MMM Beach Walk (the Replica scents are at Sephora now (!)) and spritzed it yesterday. was quite dissonant to smell such an intensely summer scent (think sunscreen, white florals, salty tang) in the middle of autumn...\n- really want to try some Byredo scents soon. anyone have any favorites by them?\n- @yoyobeat I have some experience with BPAL, when I was scouting out the perfect rose (Peacock Queen is a lovely full, lush, non-sickly sweet rose fwiw). I recommend buying imps' ears (samples) from BPAL's site (though fair warning, shipping takes f o r e v e r), scouting eBay, or as nick recommended checking out BPAL's non-official but super popular forum (also super helpful for scent reviews).

Fragrance has the power to unlock memories and define moments, so it certainly pays to find one that you love to wear. Still, the process can be off-putting, to say the least.\nSeldom can you truly understand how a perfume is going to smell on your skin without having worn it for a prolonged period of time. This is why I always advise getting your hands on a tester if at all possible.  However, I acknowledge that obtaining these testers isn't always easy, especially if you don't live near a stockist which carries the perfume you want to try. Online, it's not much simpler either. Very few sites offer to send out testers in the post, meaning you're left to buy fragrance blind. And when a bottle can cost anything from \u00a330 to \u00a3250, it's a bit of a gamble. So what do I suggest? If you're in any doubt, opt for a French perfume.\nThere are certain things the French do exceptionally well, and one of them is creating perfumes. Although France wasn't the first country to start blending perfume, French perfume brands are considered some of the best in the world. In France, perfume became popular during the Renaissance when Catherine de M\u00e9dicis, the wife of King Henri II, encouraged those in the French court to wear a floral elixir when in her presence. Today, French perfumes consistently grace best-selling fragrance lists from around the world.\nWhen you think of France and the women who live there, notions of timeless elegance often spring to mind, and that's precisely what you can expect from fragrances formulated on French soil, too. Whether they're creations from leading brands in the olfactory industry\u2014such as Diptyque and Ex Nihilo\u2014or scents created by the country's defining fashion houses\u2014think Chanel, Dior, and YSL\u2014there's just something about French perfumes that makes them perennial.\nOf course, it's impossible to pigeonhole French perfumes; some are woody and spicy or clean and fresh, while others are sexy and saccharine. It really depends on the preferences of the perfumery and the specific blend in question. But you can rest assured that a French perfume<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " far more accomplished and not provocative for the sake of being provocative, there\u2019s no denying that the shock factor of the opening is high. Unless, unlike me, you\u2019re one of those people who absolutely live for the most challenging parts of a perfume, like the Listerine mouthwash of Serge Lutens\u2019 Tub\u00e9reuse Criminelle\u2019s topnotes or the putrid cherry cough syrup first half of Diptyque\u2019s Kimonanthe, in which case, the \u2018burning rubber plantation\u2019 portion of Tyrannosaurus Rex will be the highlight.\nFor me, though, the latter parts of the scent are the most enjoyable because that\u2019s when everything relaxes and the warning system in my solar plexus stops ringing. This is where things get seriously sensual. Only two components of the drydown are identifiable to me, or at least familiar. First, a minty-camphoraceous balsam note, like a solid cube of Carmex set to melt gently on a hot plate, mixed with the gritty brown sugar crystals of benzoin or some other ambery material. At times, it smells like fir balsam and old leather mixed with vanilla ice-cream (soft and almost creamy), and at others, it is bitter and metallic, thanks to rose oxide, a material that smells like nail polish mixed with mint leaves and rose.\nThe second component in the drydown, for me, is the sandalwood. Although I don\u2019t know whether sandalwood synthetics or natural sandalwood oil was used, the note reminds me very much of Dabur Chandan Ka Tail (Oil of Sandalwood), a santalum album from India that\u2019s sold as an ayurvedic medicine rather than as something to be used as perfume. Dabur comes in a small glass container with a rubber cap to allow penetration by a syringe, which you\u2019re supposed to remove, but that I (not being a meticulous person in general) do not. Accordingly, the topnotes carry a bitter, smoky rubber and fuel exhaust overtone that\u2019s curiously addictive. Tyrannosaurus Rex\u2019s sandalwood component is roughly similar: it is creamy and aromatic, but tainted by all these weird little wafts of rubber and car exhaust that add character to the usual pale milk of sandalwood.  Damn, give me a big, rich sandalwood base any day and you\u2019ve got me. It\u2019s like nuzzling into the chest of a biker who\u2019s ridden through 50 miles of Mysore forest.\nA friend (and fellow blogger) often teases me for not being clear in my review about whether I like the scent or not, and that\u2019s fair: I tend to get bogged down in analysis and forget to tell you whether or not a scent connected with me at a personal level. So, let me be clear \u2013 I absolutely loved Tyrannosaurus Rex. The opening is too powerful for my taste, but for the most part, I loved the warmth and \u2018bigness\u2019 of this perfume.  In other words, although there\u2019s a certain amount of head-scratching and puzzling over notes to be done here (which will please bored fragheads), it\u2019s also very easy to step away from the analysis and simply enjoy wearing the thing itself. And you know, apart from the over-fueled opening, I do.\nDSH Parfums Le Smoking is, to my nose, a happy mix of the bitter, smoked-out leather of Cabochard (Gr\u00e8s) and the sweet hashish vibe of Coze (Parfumerie Generale), two perfumes so hard-wired into the scent memory portion of my brain that it\u2019s difficult to judge Le Smoking on its own merits.<|endoftext|>"

However, the composition could\u2019ve breathed more. While I\u2019m not on Team Vanilla, vanilla makes sense as a balance to all that dirty, dry manly-man stuff. Alas, this vanilla was nearly as dry as the rest\u2014and not terribly enigmatic, I\u2019m afraid.\nUnderstandably, this is a hit with those seeking testosterone in a 50ml bottle. For a fragrance inspired by art and the sea, though, Coeur de Noir seems a rather earthbound exercise. Lime and ambergris might seem too literal, but a smidge of each would\u2019ve gone a long way here.\nRe-purchased Nautica Voyage. As I no longer care what the season is when choosing my fragrance of the day--and believe any gender can wear any perfume--I have finally decided to no longer let my age determine what I do or don't wear.\nI have finally decided to no longer let my age determine what I do or don't wear.\nThat explains your Dr. Denton\u2019s.\nGreat edit there!\nGivenchy EAU de : cologney.\nDior Homme Sport latest... Mmm... nah..\nPrada L'homme water splash : loving original, this is a nice lighter alternative.\nEstee Lauder's \"exclusive to John lewis' line... Seemed fairly simple, perhaps built.to be layered. Nice bottles and magnetic cap. The floral leather and spicy amber are th two that stood out.\nPrecieuse Folie by Antinomie Parfums which I loved.\nDescribed variously as 'chaos in a bottle' and 'an alchemist's Christmas party,' this addictive fragrance is a celebration of that which is smoked: lapsang souchong, heavily peated whisky, dark tobaccos, spice, and opium combine to produce an intensely provocative fragrance using heavily \u2018overdosed\u2019 ingredients. Paradoxical and challenging\u2014singular and narcotic.\nVi et Armis is indeed \u201ca celebration of that which is smoked.\u201d Fortunately, it doesn\u2019t emulate the smoked meat smorgasbord of Le Labo Patchouli 24. Instead, it opens like a pine forest on fire, all camphor and cinders. Once this forbidding phase fades, the lapsang souchong and Islay single malt come to the fore, though the barrel for the latter is still flame-licked.\nThe net result is unbalanced by anything smoke-free, but at least they didn\u2019t try to put out the fire with vanilla ice cream. Masculine to the point of self-parody, methinks the fellas at Beaufort could use a woman\u2019s touch\u2014even if it\u2019s Ronda Rousey\u2019s.\nTesting Vilhelm Dear Polly. we\u2019ll see how this one unfolds but right now I\u2019m getting that EA Green Tea vibe that I really dislike.\nThis is another one that could definitely be described as testosterone in a bottle. One of the most powerful smokey boozy things I've ever smelled, I got a sample randomly thrown in with another purchase when I was just first getting into fragrance and I remember thinking \"wtf is this???\"\nVery similar, particularly in the opening, to Ropion's Oud Malaki, but with less of a \"spice market\" ambiance. It eventually goes its own way, moving towards a surprisingly satisfying drydown mingling lavender and resinous tones.\nNot earth-shattering, but very nicely composed.\nYes, I deliberately queued it up next as a sort of \u201cpissing contest\u201d (though there\u2019s nothing pissy about either Couer de Noir or Vi et Armis). I\u2019ll edit my thoughts about VeA into my initial post, but it\u2019s certainly different from CdN, although similarly challenging in the opening. Dr. T. was not a fan, but she\u2019s warmed to it a bit since it passed the \u201cpunch you in the nose\u201d phase.\nGuerlain L'Homme Ideal EDP, disappointingly synthetic.\nElectimuss Imperium, a creamy less fruity version of Creed Aventus.\nI'd expect nothing less from a brand started by a member of The Prodigy, firestarter indeed! Although its not to my taste, I give him credit for making a legitimate and pretty interesting brand and not just some tossed off vanity project. I'll always carry the strong memory of my relatively noob nose experiencing this for the first time and being shocked at what perfume can do. The sometimes unexpected glory of random unrequested samples!\nThe sometimes unexpected glory of random unrequested samples!\nMost of my ridiculously large sample library was acquired in reasonably priced bulk buys from people who had indulged their eclectic tastes but eschewed hoarding. The result is a wide range of (at least theoretically) interesting scents I might never have sought out individually. The surprise factor alone keeps me entertained.\nDirty Pineapple by Richard - a very nice fruity aromatic which I love.\nA fragrance for the intrepid: challenging preconceptions of what \u2018Aquatic\u2019 truly means. In contrasting the above and below, light and shade, we imagine the eternally changing state of the sea\u2014in constant flux between calm and wild.\nSalt meets earth, sparkling herbals blend with dark mosses, bright floral notes meet intense dark spices and pepper.\nPer the above, Fathom V is not your father\u2019s aquatic, but rather a thoughtful interpretation of what an aquatic can be, and thus quite workable for one as aquatic-averse as myself. The top has green notes that brighten like citrus; the base, an animalic salinity that suggests real ambergris or a really fine approximation. In the middle of all this is lily, though not the off-putting funereal lily that I cannot abide. Not quite like anything else I\u2019ve worn, from Beaufort or anywhere else.\n Go figure.\nTesting Diptyque Volutes edp today. I quite like this one. Judging by the dabber vial application this could work well as my warm autum weather tobacco scent. Worth tracking down a spray sample/decant and that\u2019s more than I can say for the last several things I\u2019ve sampled.\nSeveral Gloria Vanderbilt fragrances apart from the classic Vanderbilt EDP- good to downright great variations on the fairly traditional Vanderbilt style, but also with solid additional freshness while also keeping up above average performance in each.\nWhat\u2019s disappointed you recently?<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "To say 2020 has been stressful is the understatement of the year, so as you\u2019re holiday shopping for the stressed-AF people in your life, attempt to to alleviate their worries with the help of these aromatherapy gifts. I mean, do I know anyone who isn\u2019t anxious these days? I don\u2019t think so, so you best believe I\u2019ll be buying all the picks below.\nLet\u2019s get this straight: These gifts won\u2019t fix everything or make your worries magically disappear, but they will create a relaxing moment in your giftee\u2019s day. It\u2019s all about creating pockets of bliss amidst the chaos! Aromatherapy uses your sense of smell to calm your mind and body, so these gifts are top-notch picks for anyone that\u2019s overworked or overwhelmed.\nThink about what happens when you light a candle\u2014you just feel a little more, well, at-peace. These aromatherapy gifts take that idea a step further by incorporating specific relaxing scents, like lavender and eucalyptus, to guarantee you can unwind and take a deep breath.\nWhen I think of aromatherapy, the essential oil diffuser immediately comes to mind, but aromatherapy gifts go beyond these (although they also make great gifts!) and include pillow sprays, scented bracelets and even the OG classic reed diffuser. Not everything has to be high-tech, people!\nI included some out-of-the-box ideas, like shower steamers, which will take your friends\u2019 #showerthoughts to a whole new level, and an aromatherapy eye pillow, which feels like an at-home face massage. Read on for the whole list, and while you\u2019re at, you might want to pick up a few things for yourself.\nIt\u2019s going to be a long winter, and we all need some extra self-care equipment on-hand. Treat yourself!\nCourtesy of VITRUVI.\nIf your friend is really into essential oils, get them a top-notch diffuser to display in their space. This one by Vitruvi is made out of porcelain and has a seven-hour runtime. Plus, it just looks super chic.\nWhether your friend has a $15 diffuser or $150 diffuser, this oil from Virtruvi will give them an ah-mazing aromatic experience. This French lavender hails from the high Alpine Hills, and it\u2019s non-toxic and vegan.\nWhenever your friend showers with one of these shower steamers on the shelf, they\u2019ll be automatically transported to a relaxing, luxury spa. Within the set of five steamers, you\u2019ll get two lavender, one eucalyptus, one mint and one lemongrass. They look good enough to eat\u2014but please, don\u2019t try it.\nCourtesy of Lagunamoon.\nIf you\u2019re gifting someone with essential oils for the first time, this is a great introduction gift set. It comes with six 10 mL bottles, with scents like lemongrass, peppermint, orange, lavender, eucalyptus and tea tree. They can try them all and find their fave.\nCourtesy of Bodha.\nFriendly reminder to unclench your jaw and rest your eyes! Bodha\u2019s Aromatherapy Eye Pillow engages pressure points, like acupuncture does, to relieve tension from your face. It also smells like lavender and chamomile flowers. This the perfect present for any stressed out friend (or, you know, for yourself).\nCourtesy of Diptyqueparis.\nNow you can bring Diptyque with you wherever you go! This perfumed bracelet includes three of their Enchanted Animal charms, which come together to create a complex scent. It\u2019s about to be your new fave accessory.\nCourtesy of LauraBotanicals/Etsy.\nBath time is always #selfcare paradise, and these bath bombs take tub bliss it to a whole new level. Each one in this set has a uniquely calming scent, ranging from Lavender Twist to Boho Bliss.\nCourtesy of Pacifica.\nDoes your friend have trouble winding down at night? This water-based lavender and vanilla spray will help send them to dreamland. Plus, it\u2019ll look so cute on their bedside table!\nCourtesy of Anjou.\nHoliday shop without breaking the bank with this beautiful diffuser by Anjou that you can score for just under $40. It can run for 12 to 15 hours and shuts down automatically when its tank runs dry.\nCourtesy of Paddywax.\nThe reed diffuser is always overlooked, as some think it isn\u2019t quite as sexy as a candle. Personally, I disagree! I\u2019d say this luxurious NEST Diffuser is a timeless classic, and the Birchwood Pine scent is my personal favorite. If your stressed-out friend doesn\u2019t want a smell that\u2019s too overpowering (AKA headache-inducing!), a reed diffuser will give off just the right amount of relaxing scent.<|endoftext|>"

Small spray of WP blooms beautifully in the hella-heat. I\u2019ve heard rumors of discontinuation. Hope not. To me, it\u2019s truly unique.\n I heard the same rumors. I keep almost getting a bottle, then I don\u2019t..\nI read it will be released in a new bottle, with a price hike (of course).\nSo glad I found a back up bottle of FeA this winter for less than 65 euro!\nIt\u00b4s great when that happens. I got most of my Serges at the start of my perfume hobby, around 10 years ago now. Prices were much more reasonable back then. My first bell jar only cost me around 100 euro\u00b4s.\nHave you ever tried Wazamba by Parfum d\u00b4Empire? It\u2019s sort of similar to Fille, and I remember liking it better at the time both came out.\nYes i think Wazamba is great as well!\nFille en aiguilles is so much sweeter on me. It reminds me of my childhood holidays in France near the Atlantic coast \u2013 sunshine and pine forests, full bodied red wines and those cute Roman churces (incense).\nWazamba smells more mineral and bitter (in a good way). Its more mysterious, right? Like a sacred ritual in a cave in a pine forest in the mountains, and apples are involved (or cider\u2026yummm cider).\nThis is exactly what FeA smells like to me! The pine forests in les landes on the west coast of France.\nThat teapot is gorgeous!\nJust smelled Agar Ebene again today. It is lovely and subtle. I prefer Cedre Sambac though, as I can smell it better.\nBack in Ormonde Jayne today with Tiare. Like yesterday\u2019s Sampaquita, I think it goes with the painting (for the same reasons). I really like both but I think I like Tiare just a tad more.\nMy son and his girlfriend are flying in tomorrow evening to stay until Sunday. I\u2019m so excited to see them. I\u2019m taking off half a day Thursday (I\u2019m sure they will sleep in anyway) and all day Friday to spend with them. It\u2019s making work tough because a) I don\u2019t love work anyway and b) the anticipation of seeing my \u201cbabies\u201d!\nSweet! Have fun on your long weekend!\nYay for you! Have a great visit!\nHow wonderful \u2013 have fun with your guests. I hope you have a great time.\nAlso, I\u2019m turning my son\u2019s gf into a little perfumista. I\u2019ve given her so many samples and such lately and she loves it. She is excited to dig into my sample stash and such. Yay haha!\nExcellent! Sign her up on NST.\nHave fun, KellyC!\nTesting Kyse again \u2013 Fichi e Panna on one wrist, and Fumee Vanille on the other. Fumee Vanille is the clear winner today, with a very good balance between smoke and vanilla, five minutes in.\nI try with fig scents, I really do. I think I should love them. I love the trees, I love eating the fruit, I love the uniqueness of a fig perfume\u2019s opening notes with the weird mix of fresh green and milky sap.  And yet, I just don\u2019t want that scent on my skin.  But not ever, apparently, like a fig tree.\nI feel you, fig is not for everyone.\nHilarious notes though. And yes I rarely find a fig fragrance that I enjoy, despite thinking I *should* like them.\nFig Tea from Parfums de Nicolai is an exception, probably because I smell more the osmanthus than any actual fig.\nAgreed, both on disliking fig scents but enjoying Fig-Tea because it doesn\u2019t smell like fig (or fig leaf).\nYep, it\u2019s a note I do not enjoy but also feel like I should. Fig! What\u2019s not to like?\nhaha I almost feel the \u201cfig \u201d perfumista peer pressure.\nI feel the same about Tauer perfumes. Absolutely unwearable on me, but \u2026but \u2026but \u2026the cool kids love them\u2026. and i want to be cool\u2026.\nI\u2019m with you on Tauer (if it makes you feel any better to have company). But on fig scents, have you tried Robin\u2019s patented layering combination of Diptyque Philosykos over Tam Dao (or vice versa)? It\u2019s really beautiful.\nI have not. And I do love Tam Dao. Must try, thank you!\nI can\u2019t wear fig either.\nI love to eat figs. CanNOT do fig scents. It\u2019s an automatic recoil for me.\nWearing Je Revien (Worth) and enjoying it on a warm summer day.\nVERY warm here, and humid\u2026glad you found the right scent!\nYou sound happy. Enjoy your carefree day!????\nLove it! so summery and lovely!\nYou smell very nice. That\u2019s a good one.\nBelieve it or not, it is still going strong. It\u2019s creamy, coconut with a touch of floral. So nice on a warm summer night.\nWearing LPDRosine Une Folie de Rose\u2026from a generous sample from Kpaint. I love it! But, I think I love all decent Rose/Patchouli scents. Maybe there are some bad ones out there, but I love this, love Agent Provocateur, and my bottle of Moonlight Patchouli. My nose may not be refined enough to pick up on all the differences.\nI really wish I had some Caron Bellodgia to wear for the Community Project! I smelled it for the first time at Caron in Paris this April, and I immediately thought of a Beavery Hills Housewife from the 60\u2019s, no joke!\nI have a decant of that which I wore the other night and thoroughly enjoyed. I get a bit hit of anise that\u2019s airy and sheer, which had a nice cooling effect. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever worn it in hot weather but I\u2019ll have to remember to give it a try.\noh cool, let me know if you do try it in the warmer weather and what you think!\nI\u2019m in Heure Exquise as it\u2019s only 77 degrees here! We\u2019ve had several days of much needed rain, and will probably get a couple more before going back into the weather oven.\nGoodness, that teapot is beautiful. Want.\nI\u2019m envying you your weather today!\nI am overdue for a Harney order too!\nGo Poland, go! Our first match of FIFA World Cup is live now.\nI\u2019m wearing Wonderly by The House of Oud. Not bad at all.\nYou must be irritated. Bad judgment by that ref. Really bad.\nSotd is No. 19, I think it matches the picture because it\u2019s Chanel. All I can smell though is my coworkers Bright Crystal. \nFWIW, I would rather smell your perfume than Bright Crystal, too!\nHa! Thanks????\nI, too, was originally thinking of wearing Chanel all week for the same \u201cbecause it\u2019s Chanel\u201d reason????\nWhat are everyone\u2019s favorite rhubarb perfumes?\nI was surprised by the rhubarb in Idyllwild. It kept playing peekaboo behind the cypress and fir notes.\nOoh I still haven\u2019t tried Idyllwild. Will put it high on my list.\nMy \u2018vote\u2019 goes to Idyllwild as well!\nI prefer the rhubarb in Rose Ikebana to Ecarlate. I was going to say that I liked the rhubarb in Arielle Shoshana but I guess that\u2019s passionfruit? They are kind of similar, though.\nWould you believe I\u2019ve never tried Rose Ikebana in the 11 years that I\u2019ve plunged into perfume world? I must try it this summer!\nI hear you on the rhubarb/passionfruit similarity. I wore the Ari EDP yesterday, and I love the first 30-60 min so much.\nMaybe I\u2019ll take springpansy with me so we can overtake the SA.????\nBritt Red but I think it has been discontinued. Bought it for the bottle (to match the drained bottles of the regular Britt and Britt Gold) but fell in love with the fragrance too. Britt Red has long been empty but I still kept all three bottles.\nOh interesting! I think I still have a decant of Brit Red. I don\u2019t recall getting any rhubarb from it, but I\u2019ll try it again.\nThanks! I\u2019ll try to search this week for the decant. I remember it most for its gingerbread note, but I think I haven\u2019t worn it on years.\nOnly rhubarb I have is a decant of the Aedes de Venustas. I haven\u2019t decided how I feel about it yet, though to be honest. I like the tart fruity start and then I\u2019m a bit more meh... I should pull it<|endoftext|>"

I don\u2019t think the testers are out in shops so it\u2019s all a bit tricky at the moment!\nMolecule 02. It is almost a non scent, so clean and fresh but very sexy, almost like natural pheromones. People literally chase me around the building when I wear it but not in an over powering way and you can\u2019t smell it on yourself. Only need a few sprays.\nThe lightest, most subtle that you've got. Honestly, perfume is such a subjective thing that there's almost nothing that everyone would like. I cannot stand jasmine or iris but my best mate loves them.\nInsolence by Guerlain.\nMy all time favourite, I always get complimented on this.\nI don't want to remember someone's scent at work, I just don't want to get a migraine or asthma attack from them.\nNo perfume at all would be the best.\nWith all due respect, I didn't ask for input on whether I should wear scent..just suggestions for something light but pleasant to wear.\nI work in an extremely large space, well ventilated, where everyone else will be wearing scent too. Its highly unlikely that my abstinence would make any difference.\nYou might like Frederic Malle's Lipstick Rose, based on the notes you like - it is very expensive but absolutely delicious. Also Diptyque Eau Duelle on the more gourmand side. I tend to wear the ED a lot in autumn/winter, and the FM more in spring.\nOP, come and join us on the perfumista thread for suggestions - we never tell people not to wear perfume, and are very friendly!\nI like Guerlain Insolence too. It's violet based.\nI love Prada Iris too. I wear Hugo Boss The Scent for work. It's powdery and fresh and not overpowering for daytime.\nLalique Amethyst always makes me think of violets, they used to do a lighter version; Amethyst Eclat but sadly that isn\u2019t available anymore.\nBath House do one called Life Is. The original Stella is rose-based I think.\nDolce & Gabanna - 'The One' is a lovely, light scent.\nI didnt know that \u2018scent for work\u2019 was a thing.\nWhere do you work / what do you do OP?\nIf you\u2019re looking for something fresh and clean smelling then issey miyake L'eau d'issey is beautiful. There\u2019s a summer version too.\nI wear Coco Mademoiselle by Chanel. Wear it to work and outside of work. Now wondering if it's too overpowering for an office....\nI'd recommend M& S Vanilla & Woods which is a lovely floral gourmand fragrance and a huge bottle which is cheap as chips! Their new fragrance range is really good - Mimosa & Bergamot is gorgeous too.\nI also love Bath House Life is.... as recommended above!\nMisia by Chanel might appeal, too nice for work though.\nI wear either Paul Smith Rose or Elizabeth Arden Green Tea, but both are so subtle that I doubt anybody ever notices.\nKenzo Flower is a nice, light violet one.\nKenzo flower is the one I had to beg a colleague not to wear as it caused migraines.\nElizabeth Arden True Love is a soft, powdery floral that\u2019s also pretty cheap.\nNina Ricci Rose Extase if you want a fairly cost-effective gourmand rose.\nGuerlain L\u2019Instant Magic is a soft and powdery and leans gourmand.\nIf you want to be a bit more spends, agree that Chanel Misia is lovely. Also 4160 Tuesdays Tart\u2019s Knicker Drawer and if you want to blow the big bucks, PDM Delina.\nPortrait of a Lady by Frederic Maple is another powdery rose.\nKenzo flower as others have said is clean and light.\nWhy do people wear perfume to work?  Just be clean and you won't need to wear perfume.\nAs someone who used to regularly be in the toilets with bouts of nausea from someone's perfume, just don't.\nAnd even if you do wear it, please spray it at home. Don't carry it in your bag and spray on more when you're at work to \"refresh it\".\nI would fully support a ban on all forms of fragrance at work. I don't need to be smelling 37 different types of perfume/cologne every time I walk to the printer.\nPeople wear perfume to work because they like to.

        "passage": "Editing down the products to include in my annual Christmas Gift Guide is certainly not an easy task, but it\u2019s one of the things that I truly savour every year. Searching through hundreds of stores, testing out countless beauty products \u2013 all so that I can recommend the best of the best for you to treat your loved ones with this Christmas. I considered breaking this down into a few posts; gifts for mum, gifts for your best friend, etc etc, but as it\u2019s just so personal I thought instead I would just share with you all of my favourite products which I think would make a fabulous gift for any fabulous friend or family member that you\u2019re looking to spoil this year.\nThe gifts range from beauty stocking fillers to luxurious high end gifts, so hopefully there will be something for every budget and taste.\nIt\u2019s a long one, so without further ado, here\u2019s my 2016 Christmas Gift Guide!\nWithout doubt the hugest category and one with millions of fabulous products to choose from! Candles are always a beautiful gift, and this year Clarins have a fabulous festive Tonic candle to help create that spa feeling at home \u2013 all encased within a beautiful golden glass. Diptyque always have some fabulous options too, and this year their Christmas Candles have the most extraordinarily luxurious scents, they make the perfect gift or stocking filler \u2013 something incredibly luxurious that a proud homeowner may not necessarily splurge on for themselves.\nGift sets always elevate a beauty gift \u2013 and from nail varnishes to skincare, this year there are more fabulous sets than ever before. No matter what age, the perfect gift for those that love to care for their nails is a set from Deborah Lipman, the Ice Princess set is a personal favourite \u2013 a wearable classic pink as well as a festive sparkle shade!\nSkincare sets don\u2019t come much better than Liz Earle, and the Bright Eyes gift set is perfect for those already converted to the Cleanse and Polish. Those who like their skincare to be a little more natural would also appreciate the Body Shop\u2018s personalised body butters \u2013 get their name printed to make a luxurious gift even more special. For those that like those lesser known brands, or just appreciate fine natural ingredients, a gift from Lola\u2019s Apothecary will tick all the boxes. The products are not only beautiful to look at, but equally sumptuous on the body; my current favourite being the body and massage oils.\nMakeup is a fabulous gift to receive; especially when it\u2019s from a luxury brand that we may not often splurge on ourselves. This year, Bobbi Brown have out-done themselves with their festive offering \u2013 encased in beautiful gold packaging, and wearable, luxurious shades within.\nPalettes are often hard to get your hands on, which makes them an exclusive and coveted gift; this year, beauty lovers will no doubt have the Anastasia Glow Kit, Urban Decay Naked Ultimate Basics, and a palette by Tarte at the top of their wishlist.\nAs always, the highstreet has some incredible value sets too \u2013 each year I am always lucky enough to find a massive gift set from Soap & Glory under my tree \u2013 ensuring that my pamper evenings are topped up with the most sumptuous products. If your recipient is into their oils, perhaps a gift set from Neals Yard Remedies or NEOM would be even more to their taste.\nTreat a lipstick lover to a gift set featuring the most lust-worthy shades, and they\u2019ll be selfie ready for the New Year \u2013 an affordable and incredibly blogger-approved option is this MUA Luxe set, the only tough decision is which shade to wear first!\nPerfumes are absolutely always a winner at Christmas \u2013 it\u2019s often a personal choice so finding out what they already wear is often a great place to start. The scents that I have chosen however are easy to love, incredibly wearable scents. Nina Ricci is a classic scent \u2013 instantly loved by all who experience it, and the fabulous apple perfume bottle looks simply beautiful on the dressing table. For those that don\u2019t like to smell like anyone else, Replica have created fragrance \u2018filters\u2019 to layer with an existing scent to make it absolutely personal to the wearer.\nAnother personal favourite is Viktor & Rolf\u2019s Flowerbomb, this year they have plenty of options to choose from, including an Extreme oud, or the slightly sweeter Bon Bon couture for those who like their scents light and feminine.\nFragrance gift sets are a fabulous treat to receive, and this year my favourites include the Elie Saab Le Parfum Rose Couture; containing not just the beautiful fragrance, but also two body lotions to let you enjoy the scent for even longer. An even more glamorous and sophisticated option is the Bulgari Godea set; and you can always ensure you\u2019re paying the best price when stocking up on gift sets at FragranceDirect.co.uk!\nFrom the affordable to the absolutely excessive, it\u2019s magical to treat someone to a luxurious scent from a lesser known brand \u2013 perfect for the true fragrance connoisseurs. This year, two that have caught my eye are Lalique and Kilian \u2013 exquisitely crafted and blended to the highest quality, these are fragrances at their finest. A trip to their London boutiques is a must to experience these intense fragrances in the brand\u2019s opulent surroundings.\nPerfect for stocking fillers, gifts for hosts at parties, and simply fun extra treats, beauty Baubles and Crackers are a truly wonderful way of giving someone a slightly more unusual treat. Ranging from high-street to luxury, this year there are more than ever \u2013 but here are a few that really caught my eye.\nWhen it comes to baubles, Decleor have created designs that are truly beautiful enough to re-use as decorations, with nourishing lip balms encased within, while ghd have giant golden baubles filled with essentials such as their Serum or Split End Therapy balm.\nAlso from Escentual, I spotted a beauty cracker from Nuxe, containing skincare minis, it\u2019s the perfect way to trial some of the most popular products from the brand. Those who love to indulge in their beauty sleep will appreciate the Sleep Spell cracker from ThisWorks, while those who can\u2019t complete the day without a luxurious cleanse will adore the Oskia Merry & Bright cracker which holds the brand\u2019s bestselling Renaissance cleanser inside.\nFor a dinner party with a twist, what about a set of beauty crackers from The Vintage Cosmetics Company? The beautiful retro design is festive yet fashionable, and each one has a luxury beauty gift inside.\nAnd finally \u2013 my own wishlist!\nOf course, I couldn\u2019t do a gift guide without including the pieces that I\u2019d hope to find under my tree this year! I may be wildly optimistic, but a girl can dream, right?! I think a lot of fashionistas will have the new Gucci Marmont on their Christmas Wishlist, and this chevron print design has truly caught my eye, while I just know I\u2019d get so much use out of these Sophia Webster Butterfly Beauties.\n You can get 15% off your order with code Josie15 if you fancy treating someone to a beautiful accessory from the brand.\nWhat\u2019s on your Christmas Wishlist this year?<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "You also sound like a candidate for Ormonde Jayne Woman.\nRe: OJ Woman, for my two cents, I got a lot of violet from it, but it\u2019s such a nice scent that maybe it\u2019ll be the violet that changes Lindsay\u2019s mind on that note!\nGood, it\u2019s gorgeous!\nHi, thank you! A dear friend wears the Ormonde Jayne\u2026I agree it is gorgeous, but I don\u2019t want to steal her scent.\nThese ideas are not at all in precisely the same vein, but each meet at least several of the criteria!\nSo I\u2019m not the BEST judge because I like almost anything fig-related, so take this with a grain of salt\u2013but of the various fig fragrances I can think of off the top of my head (Jo Malone Wild Fig & Cassis; Hermes Jardin en Mediterranee; Pacifica Mediterranean Fig; L\u2019Artisan Premier Figuier), Philosykos is the one I\u2019d describe as least oriented toward the sweet, fruit element of the fig, and most gets the rest of the fig tree, the leaves, the bark, the dirt, the grass around it, etc. Robin\u2019s review captures it beautifully.\nShould say, I\u2019m doubly biased though, as it was also one of the first niche fragrances I smelled when I caught the mania. Def among the scents that revised\u2013enlarged\u2013my idea of what perfume could be, so I\u2019m very partial to it!\nMe, again. Try the soap. $7.00. It was our gateway to the EdT. Heaven.\nThat sounds gorgeous\u2026I will try the soap!\nI completely agree with the L\u2019Heure Verteuse recommendation, and that was my first thought\u2013lavender and green herb garden, nearly medicinal, but I love it. I hope Lindsay likes it. I find it relaxing and refreshing. I\u2019d add Andy Tauer\u2019s Reverie au Jardin to the list, for nearly the same reasons, but a bit more incense in the end. Be well!\nDiptyque L\u2019ombre dans l\u2019Eau EDT for tart, green blackcurrant leaves with a hint of rose.\nChanel Sycomore is a unsex vetiver slightly rooty, slightly smoky, Guerlain Vetiver pour Elle is a more feminine combination vetiver + jasmine.\nOJ Tiare, Chanel Cristalle or Diorella for that savoury, mossy, floral, citrus, woody chypre.\nMiller Harris Terre de Bois.\nSeconding l\u2019Ombre and Sycomore!\nWhen I read \u201cgreen and alive and botanical\u201d I immediately thought of Jardin du Poete by Eau d\u2019Italie. A wonderful perfume with grapefruit in the opening which quickly evolves into herbal smell of basil and angelica.\nAnother thing that comes to my mind is Jardin d\u2019Ecrivains Wilde, my recent discovery. A lovely green and milky fig perfume. Or maybe Mona di Orio Eau Absolue will do the trick?\nI also highly recommend Parfum d\u2019Empire Eau de Gloire. It has a smell of shrubs and herbs combined with lavender and star anise. Very pretty.\nLove three of those recommendations! Zeta is brilliant (but sometimes to harsh on me). Reverie au Jardin is fabulous, great lavender with iris and fir. Le Chevrefeuille is an ultra happy scent, I wish it lased all day long.\nAh, I love Grand Bal too! Simple but so beautiful.\nSounds like any number of the Jo Malones would work, like Lime Basil Mandarin, Grapefruit, Black Vetyver Cafe, French Lime Blossom. O de Lancome might be nice, too. Leave us not forget Chanel No. 19, too. Seconding Cartie Baiser Vole. My personal preference is for the EDP, but the EDT is very green.\nSeconding all, esp the No. 19 and the JMs\u2013on the one hand they\u2019re kind of light but on the other hand, they make lots of good body products that can give them more staying power. Def worth testing.\nIf you really like green, Papyrus de Ciane by Parfumerie Generale might be worth a look. It\u2019s very green and a little incensy. Vetiver Dance by Andy Tauer might work for you too. And I second Chanel No. 19. Serge Lutens Bas de Soie is another that you might be interested in. It is mostly an iris scent, but it has a very green opening.\nI recently bought a bottle of Vent Vert (the Calice Becker, I believe 1990 reformulation) online for a very good price and have been really enjoying it this spring/early summer. Very green, herbal, and fresh, and I can also smell some lily-of-the-valley and maybe other florals.\nsecond Chanel No19 and Sycomore. Add Bel Respiro (also Chanel), and for a green, very alive floral Carnal Flower. Frederic Malle\u2019s French Lover/Bois d\u2019Orage smells like bitter forest tree sap.\nMiller Harris \u201cLa Pluie\u201d is herbal and floral, beautifully so, also the tiniest bit sweet.\nAnd for the showstopping greenery, Parfum Del Rae\u2019s beautiful but unrelenting \u201cDebut.\u201d Wow!\nSeconding Debut. That\u2019s what I planned on recommending.\nSeconding the recommendations for Philosykos and L\u2019Heure Verteuse. OJ Woman, too \u2014 it\u2019s wonderfully forest-y! I\u2019ll also add Profumum Victrix and Vero Profumo Mito to your list; both are very green and herbal.\nLesNez \u2014 Turtle Vetiver!\n+ 1 Ormonde Woman\u2026the most beautiful wood scent. Also, vintage Diorella, and two Annick Goutals: Eau d\u2019Hadrien (lemon-pine yumminess) and Nuit Etoilee (minty citrus forest). Good luck!\nL\u2019Ombre dans l\u2019Eau \u2013 so green and then a rose is revealed. I have the EdP. Having said that, I would try first as there is a tomato leaf note. But it really evokes a garden on a summery day.\nDebut by Parfums Delrae \u2013 the greenness here is fresh and citrusy.\nGuerlain Vetiver pour Elle is hard to find but it is so beautiful! Grassy and floral at the same time. In this case, the green is from vetiver, which is usually dry and masculine, but in this case, is very well balanced with florals and sweetness. My other favorite green floral is Annick Goutal Heure Exquise, which is a galbanum (for bitter green) with iris and rose. This is similar to Chanel No 19, but warmer and richer, with a lovely sandalwood base.\nI\u2019d recommend Grey Flannel by Beene \u2014 wonderfully green, with violet and a woody base.\napologies for any repetitions\u2026\u2026.just try to see them as meaning you should really try the ones other people have mentioned before!\n\u2018green alive and botanical\u2019\u2026\u2026.on second thoughts, i would add also to the list, Frangipani from Ormonde Jayne. It\u2019s actually very sharp and has a lime peel note, and is greenhouse-fresh white flowers.\nLove this for modern chypre.\nI would say, Eau de Camille or Eau De Charlotte, Annick Goutal.\noh ya, fyi..Eau de Camille, nice grass, green/ slightly stemmy + honeysuckle..and Eau De Charlotte, again, stemmy green with a little bit of a dark side, but a light dark side..lightened by yellow notes.\nI\u2019d say to definitely try both! I\u2019d guess Eau de Camille would be more up alley though, it\u2019s a good scent.\nIt can\u2019t hurt to try some classic \u201cgreens\u201d like Bandit, Crystalle and Estee Lauder Private Collection.\nEtat Libre d\u2019Orange Eloge du Traitre (you may also like ELd\u2019O Afternoon of the Faun\u2026 I think it is quite well done, but it is too floral for me).\nI agree that Chanel Sycomore is lovely, however fleeting.\nBest of luck! Enjoy your sniffing adventure.\nHi, thank you so much! I am going to try both of the Etat Libre d\u2019Orange scents. I am especially excited about the Afternoon of a Faun.\nAnnick Goutal Heure Exquise and Pennhaligon\u2019s Amaranthine! Try Parfums Nicolai Vie de Chateau as well!\nAlso, SSS makes a gorgeous green fig fragrance called Fig Tree (less sticky sweet dried fig and more creamy green fig), which is one of my favorite scents by any maker, large or small!\nI will definitely try the Jour Ensoleille!\nTokyo Milk makes something called Crushed. I think it\u2019s one of the Darks \u2013 sort of a range within the line.\nAnyway, it\u2019s very interesting \u2013 sort of herbal, grassy, with some nice mineral/dirt<|endoftext|>"

I live in an organic-loving town, so I\u2019ve recommended products that are just about free of everything deemed harmful (see tomorrow\u2019s post).

Anyway it arrived a few weeks back and I really like it. Have always associated lavender with sleep/somnolence, but this is a sweet and summery thing. It lifts the mood and isn\u2019t remotely soporific, quite the opposite. It\u2019s a nice perfume for summer, sure, but worn in the dead grey of winter, it\u2019s something harvested in brighter days bearing the promise that the sun and better days will return. Or something. It\u2019s very good.\nSlightly practical question: 19 year old nephew requested Nasomatto's Blamage for his birthday. It's \u00a3125 so he can jog on.\nWhat should he have? Not Lynx before someone suggests that. Bonus points if not tested on animals.\nReminded me of Bulgari Black, a gorgeous fragrance in its own right, however it\u2019s not sold in the UK anymore so you have to order it online from fragrancex or similar (15% off though). Well worth his time. And yes, it\u2019s legit, I\u2019ve bought from there before and checked the batch codes.\nBulgari Black is an interesting fragrance to be sure, though it does have a burnt rubber note that might be a turnoff for some.\nSorry I couldn't think of a suggestion. L'Homme Ideal L'Intense by Guerlain has some of those characteristics but not the animalic or the musky. Chanel Antaeus would seem a good match, and is one I love personally, but it might smell too old-fashioned for a 19-year-old (after all it was introduced in 1981).\nthis thread inspired me to order a bunch of CdG samples and see which pleased me. i've been drawn to their line of fragrances for a long time but had never picked any up. finally ordered myself a bottle of Wonderoud as a birthday treat. i'm also a fan of Concrete, but found it barely detectable on my skin after a short while. maybe i just need a bigger supply.\nhmm, i guess Concrete is a skin scent and not meant to project? neat.\nif i like something i'll look up the notes on fragrantica or basenotes. usually i can then pick out a few of the prominent notes but most fragrances have so many notes that they're all jumbled up in an amorphous scent cloud. if i'm unsure of what a particular note smells like i'll try several fragrances that feature that note and just kinda eliminate the differences.\nafter my last post i went crazy and bought bottles of CdG's (underappreciated) Concrete and (much praised) Copper, and i'd like to get more stuff from that house... i guess i'm a bit of a label whore.\nanyway, this stuff is pretty fun and i get why people get into collecting perfumes/colognes. that last purchase it for me for a while, though\u2014cutting myself off until i use most of what i've ordered and Luckyscent takes all my money.\nI have been wanting to splurge on a bunch of samples lately but I\u2019m trying to be good and use the frags I have because they are really lovely.\nI just want a sample of every Tom Ford fragrance please.

        "passage": " from the pack: A) It's made in France, B) it lathers like a dream upon contact with warm water, C) it's dermatologist-tested and D) ginger and vetiver round out the scent's rosy demeanor.\nIt can be difficult to maintain a plush, plump and velvety-smooth pout once the summer elements hit, but this organic and vegan lip hero truly deserves a cape. It's expertly formulated with vitamin E\u2013rich cupua\u00e7u butter, decadent desert date oil and inflammation-calming licorice root.\nSay it with us: You're never too old for a Pretty Woman\u2013level bubble bath. This best-selling formula boasts mallow blossom (to soothe), pine oil (to nourish) and juniper berry (to disinfect and detoxify). It's indulgent and lovely.\nIngrowns and skin irritations are just a fact of life for anyone with pubic (or anywhere) hair, and this chic little bottle from Fur has quickly gained icon status within the beauty biz. It's both dermatologist- and gynecologist-tested, and it uses nutrient-rich grape seed and jojoba oils to hydrate along with a calming blend of tea tree and clary sage to zap irritation-causing bacteria.\nA quick introduction\u2014Vernon Fran\u00e7ois is one of the best hair artists in the industry, so really, it should be no surprise that this strand-loving co-wash receives top marks for replenishing shine, elasticity and moisture.\nOh, other dry-texturising sprays actually exist? This one from Oribe is the gold standard for a reason. The results (and smell) can't be beaten.\n'Transformative' is an adjective frequently thrown around the hair-mask playing field. Alas, this formula\u2014which contains a powerful vegetable protein that works at a molecular level\u2014is one of the best you can get your hands on. Whether your hair is craving moisture, damage repair or both, it's a grand slam. Plus, a little goes a long way, so it will last you forever.\nAttention: For anyone who has been on a never-ending search for the ultimate volumising spray, we're here to make your year. This Italian formulation is lightweight yet supremely nourishing and protective of fragile strands thanks to key ingredients like creatine, sweet almond protein, sesame seed oil and sap extract. Just spritz generously through your damp roots and ends before blow-drying and styling as you normally would.\nIf it's been a while since your last colour appointment, this clear gloss from Rita Hazan will completely revive your strands. Not only will the hue of your hair look fresher and more vibrant, but this gloss also utilises pro-vitamin B5 and silk proteins to enhance the shine, health and overall resilience of the hair.\nThis pre-shampoo treatment is an expert solution for anyone looking to enhance the bounce, shine and overall beauty of their natural texture and curls. It handily comes with a plastic cap, and it also boasts UV filters for an added dose of hair protection.\nFrom renowned French editor Carine Roitfeld comes this best-selling fragrance which, according to Roitfeld, was inspired by an unforgettable lover from Paris. Warm and inviting, it's a citrus blend anchored with Davana oil and myrrh.\nA lesser-known icon from Le Labo, Baie 19 is inspired by \"the scent of rain after a long, hot spell.\" According to the brand, it's thus infused with a heady mix of earthy notes like patchouli, juniper berries, ambrox, cade and musk.\nHere's a fun bit of trivia for you\u2014Good Girl Gone Bad is (very appropriately, we might add) Rihanna's signature perfume. This version is extra intense and stars the OG formula's signature blend of pink and white roses, orange blossoms, tuberose, Egyptian jasmine sambac and narcissus but with some added vim thanks to milky toffee.\nFragrances are meant to be special, and this one goes above and beyond. Rich in tradition, Majan's collection of fragrances are inspired by beautiful Omani heritage. This scent, MD, is an olfactory tonic that drips with notes of amber, exotic oud, saffron and benzoin.\nNot everyone loves warm, spicy or sweet fragrances. If fresh, clean and crisp scents are more your speed, you'll definitely fall for one of French fragrance brand Diptyque's more recent perfume debuts, Minth\u00e9\u2014a stunning balance of mint, geranium and patchouli.\nThis isn't your average perfume, folks. It's a scientific blend that's specifically designed to help you destress and reset. Since smells can trigger both emotional and physiological responses from the body, this scent was created based on research from the Brain and Behaviour Laboratory at the University of Geneva and with help from the global fragrance house Firmenich and legendary perfumer Frank Voelkl. So what, exactly, does a scientific soul-soothing fragrance smell like? According to The Nue Co., green cardamom, iris, palo santo and coriander.\nWithout question, this juicy bottle is one of the best Tom Ford fragrances of all time. Not surprisingly, Net-a-Porter agrees with us. We're fairly certain the mix of black cherries, liqueur, bitter almond, Turkish rose and jasmine sambac is unlike anything you've ever smelled before.\nBal D'Afrique is known as one of Byredo's most compliment-inducing perfumes. It celebrates the African culture that heavily influenced music and art in 1920s Paris and blends jasmine, sweet neroli and musk.\nUp next, these are the affordable beauty products makeup artists swear by.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Ooooh, something smells lovely! These clever candle subscriptions make a thoughtful winter gift (even if it's for yourself - shhhhh, we won't tell).\nDid you know that Tan France of Queer Eye fame has a candle closet? Literally, a cupboard just filled to the brim with beautiful candles for him to sniff when he\u2019s stressed. Ever since we spotted it on Architectural Digest, we\u2019ve coveted a closet of our own \u2013 which is where these fabulous candle subscriptions come in. Instead of schlepping round the shops for your latest candle score, simply have a new one sent through once a month! Genius.\nOf course, you don\u2019t have to keep all the goodness to yourself \u2013 a candle subscription also makes a great present if you\u2019re feeling generous, and you won\u2019t even have to wrap it. (Lazy, us? Er, well yes actually).\nExpand your candle horizons with Iggy Box, the first multi-brand candle subscription in the UK. Iggy Box works with a mix of local artisan candlemakers, so it\u2019s a great way to discover some of the slightly more niche UK brands and avoid the ubiquitous Insta names (looking at you, Diptyque). They have a real focus on eco-friendly and natural ingredients, and for those of us without a candle closet, you can pick between two different sizes if you\u2019re worried about not getting through the larger jars. Prices start at \u00a312.95 a month with free P&P.\nThe eagle-eyed among you may have spotted Brighton-based SevenSeventeen kicking around Muddy before, but did you know that they do candle subscriptions too? You can pick from 3 or 6-month subscriptions in a variety of candle sizes, and depending on which one you pick, you also get a lovely smelly sachet of lavender bath salts or a set of steel wick trimmers (which are v. useful, but also make perfect Instagram props if that\u2019s your bag). Prices start at \u00a348 for 3 months.\n You know the feeling \u2013 you\u2019ve sniffed it in the shop, hurried it home, lit it immediately and\u2026 nada. No such worries with Warwickshire-based perfume queen Rebecca Tracey, whose gorgeous scents include Lemon, Patchouli & Lemongrass and Black Pepper, Lemon & Geranium. Her candle subscriptions run for 3,6 or 12 months and see a full-sized 300g botanical candle popped through your postbox every month. Prices start at \u00a395 for 3 months.\nIf reading a good book by the light of a gorgeous candle sounds like your perfect night in, then Berkshire beauty Literati & Light should be right up your street. Its candles are inspired by the great works of fiction \u2013 so, Wuthering Heights smells of heather and rain, and its Narnia-inspired number is scented with Turkish delight, pine and snow. The brand\u2019s Book Club candle subscriptions come in Classic and Modernist versions (above), or you can even choose a Book and Candle subscription, which includes a beautifully-designed Penguin classic with your candle for \u00a370 for three months. Prices for the Classic Book Club start at \u00a350 for 3 months.\nFancy mixing it up a little? Enter The Botanical Candle Co, a Dorset-based company with so many subscriptions we can hardly choose. You can take your pick between full-size candles, wax melts and tea lights in a variety of sizes, with prices starting at a penny-pinching \u00a38 a month. We particularly love the Collaboration Subscription, which includes various goodies such as plants, soaps and stationery as well as their beautiful handmade candles for \u00a334 a month.\nIf a monthly candle subscription sounds a bit much (what will you do with all the empty jars?!), then why not plump for candles every season instead? Hazel & Blue in Wiltshire offers a quarterly candle subscription that costs \u00a394 + P&P for 4 boxes, which means as the changing seasons roll around you\u2019ll receive a large scented soy candle, a medium candle, and a chic accessory to pair with them. With scents like Raspberry and Peppercorn, Rhubarb and Plum, and Sea Salt and Wood, we\u2019ll have one for every room, please.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "This is the second time I\u2019ve stumbled across a delicious perfume in, of all places, TK Maxx. I know I should be saving up and buying beautifully wrapped bottles from expensive boutiques, but for a start I don\u2019t earn much and, second, I rather like the occasional gamble on a discounted scent that might just turn out to be fab.\nThat\u2019s certainly the case with Ninfeo Mio, a small bottle of which I picked up for a song a little while ago. I\u2019m a bit of an Annick Goutal fan, mainly for the powerful, love-it-or-hate-it Sables, but also for the better-known Eau d\u2019Hadrien, so Ninfeo Mio seemed worth a bet \u2013 and I\u2019m glad I took a punt.\nThis unisex perfume was launched in 2009 and created by Isabelle Doyen, who was Annick Goutal\u2019s assistant, and took over the development of new perfumes after Goutal\u2019s death in 1999. The first thing you smell is fig, and actually that\u2019s pretty much the last thing you smell too, and that would be just fine and dandy with me, since fig is a scent I love \u2013 both the natural thing and figtastic perfumes like Premier Figuier from L\u2019Artisan Parfumeur and Philosykos from Diptyque.\nBut the fig in Ninfeo Mio is mixed with lemon and lavender, musk and hedione, the chemical that gives Eau Sauvage much of its particular magic. These add to the character of the scent, but I think they also accentuate the figginess of the fig, which is fresh and green and slightly sweet but also a little bit dirty, with something of the sexiness of fresh sweat. It\u2019s not, perhaps, as refined a perfume as Premier Figuier, but I love its in-your-face earthiness.\nAs is so often the case, the name and the marketing \u2018story\u2019 came after the scent, or at least after it was begun. It refers to the much mooned-over gardens of Ninfa in the once-malarial marshlands south-east of Rome, which (luckily for Isbelle Doyen) turned out to be full of lemon-trees, lavender and figs. The perfume would probably have been called Ninfa Mia except that the name \u2018Ninfa\u2019 had already been copyrighted, so the more masculine Ninfeo Mio it is.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Diptyque Eau des Sens Eau De Toilette is part of the niche perfume brands that I am with a lot of pleasure and interest. I like his toilet water, always very atypical and beautifully done.\nFor once an official description is right on the money! And this is the first time that I can not put words on a fragrance, to grasp it with its notes, to understand it and to \u201ctranslate\u201d it. \u201cA little music that breathes on the skin\u201d is exactly that! But what does that mean? Well, that means the water of the senses, you have to feel it to understand it because, as the house rightly says, this fragrance lacks common sense.\nThe olfactory creations of Diptyque are atypical, the Eau des sens proves to be a paradoxical fragrance that holds us many pleasant surprises. It combines the transparency of a eau de toilette with a successful exercise around neroli and the comfort of a sensual fragrance, disturbing by its woody background.\nThe author of this perfume, the perfumer Olivier Pescheux, was inspired by the bitter orange tree. His departure around the orange blossom (or neroli) is addictive, both sparkling and fresh. This very reassuring essence plunges us into olfactory memories loaded with emotion and pleasure. But over time, this perfume becomes disturbing because it expresses its different facets over the hours. It takes us in a whirlwind of the senses, hanging here and there recognizable notes: more sustained notes like angelic, bitter orange, which give body and soul. More gourmet also with juniper berries. To gain power, patchouli gives it its seductive character. As and when it reveals a woody background twisted by spices such as ginger which allow it to retain its freshness while ensuring a singular and chic wake. Like Diptyque eau de toilette whose elegance is recognized in France and abroad.\nIn the end, this eau de toilette is very subtle, with a singular character as are usually the creations of the brand Diptyque. Unisex transparency, it will appeal to men as women by its freshness; ideal in this early spring when the weather varies with each hour alternating showers and thunderstorms, blowing hot and cold as successfully does this new perfume.<|endoftext|>"

The salon Diptyque was opened on Boulevard St.Germain in Paris. Primarily they offered home furnishings and produced printed fabrics. They also imported scents from England. But shortly (1963.) they added scented candles to the list of products by Diptyque, which became one of the main among their offers (and still is). 1968 the first Diptyque scent was launched \u2013 L`Eau, which is based on old English recipes of home fragrances.

I know many might not consider AG niche today but when I discovered this line in the early 90s it wasn\u2019t so easy to obtain and I always found the scents to be a bit out of the mainstream. I consider AG old niche b/c her first fragrance release was Folavril (1981). Today I am wearing one of my favorites Eau De Camille\u2026.the ivy and seringa is perfect for the weather that is FINALLY out of single digits! have a wonderful weekend, all!\nAG is on her own planet \u2013 definitely niche, beyond niche. I\u2019d imagine her nature inspired fragrances have inspired many other houses. She was doing transparent natural florals that disappear in short order waaay before anyone else was doing them! I love Goutal!\nyes, Ann, from our conversations on other posts I kind of figured you were a fan as well!! I am more familiar with the old stuff : Folavril, Ciel, Camille, Charlotte, Passion, Gardenia Passion, Sud, Hadrien, Ce Soir, Grand Amour, Petite Cherie and Chevrefeuille which was the last FB I purchased when it first came out. I wrote about this in another thread but years ago when I lived in a more metropolitan area the dept store that carried AGs would do BOGOs several times a year and basically you would get two 3.4 oz bottles for ninety dollars\u2026\u2026at one point I think I owned about 20 bottles (which have all since been drained). I am not familiar with the current offerings and since it is no longer accessible I haven\u2019t really sought them out\u2026.\nOh, gosh- my hears pounds! A BOGO on AG??!! Well, I can only say that the ability to find some AG on deep discounters online kind of gets to the same place, but certainly not as elegant and experience. The \u201cnewest\u201d of the AGs that I have are Rose Splendide and Ninfeo Mio, which both came out a few years ago. I don\u2019t think there are as many releases from AG now \u2013 maybe spending a lot of time re-doing the line for the relaunch, new bottles, updated formulas, etc. I would like to test the new tea one coming out this year. Oh, and I\u2019ve sampled Nuites Etoilee, and am not sure how I feel about it. But I do have 19 bottles of AG classics already!

I am really trying to be good and not buy anything until I start draining some bottles-LOL!\nCount me in, too, as a big fan of AG. i would agree, she\u2019s beyond niche.\nOne of my first favorite niches houses, too.\nWearing the grandaddy of niche scents: Diptyque\u2019s 1968 L\u2019Eau! It\u2019s almost as old as me!!\nJust saw the news that Lutens has been sold to Shiseido.I guess it makes sense for Uncle Serge to pass on his legacy to the company who helped to make him a legend?Not sure if he has an actual heir to the throne though?Lol.Is this the end of Niche as we know it?\u2026.\nDo not panic, the two companies, now one, have always been joined at the hip. I honestly do not see things changing too much and they might improve!\nStinker Kit \u2013 thank you. I went into immediate panic mode.\nHe has indeed sold the trademark, but already had a financial relationship with Shiseido so I do not see this as dire.\nYeah, it\u2019s not as if he sold it to Est\u00e9e Lauder.\nUnlike Malle, A Serge buyout would be bummer news to me.\nAnd I skimmed right past this news the first couple of times I scrolled down the comments.\nL\u2019Eau d\u2019Hiver (2003; Jean-Claude Ellena) for me. I wore it on my first date with my now-husband. For this past Christmas, he bought me the big bottle! I bet I\u2019ll use every drop.\nWore that yesterday.It\u2019s been a Malle week!Lol!The 18pc coffret was a GREAT investment!\nScent twins! Gorgeous scent and for various reasons that stuff is this-time-of-the-year-in-a-bottle form me!\nWearing Diptyque\u2019s Vetyverio today. While some may say it isn\u2019t vetiver-ish enough, my skin must amplify woody notes, because it is strongly vetiver-ish on me. But also floral. Love it.\nI can\u2019t wait to sample vetyverio \u2013 all the reviews I read about it make me think I\u2019ll enjoy it more during the summer\u2026. so I\u2019m waiting for some warm weather to try it out.\nAnn, by the time I got to the sample sale, they were all sold out of the 50mL, so I had to buy the 100 mL. However, there is NO POSSIBLE WAY I could ever need 100mL of this. I would be delighted to send you some. Email me at missionista at yahoooooo.\nI love this one, too and now that it\u2019s warming up I\u2019ll start wearing it again.\nIt\u2019s still going strong over 12 hours since application. (2 spritzes)This one does not mess around.\nI am wearing Memo Lalibela- it\u2019s niche do I get points?\nI am interested to know if anyone else has tried Memo and their thoughts?\nI love their Shams Oud, the best in the line for me.\nTam Dao EDP, in all of its woody glory. This scent is so effortless; I have yet to find a situation in which it doesn\u2019t work.\nAlso, a question \u2013 wouldn\u2019t Serge count as old-school niche by now as well? I thought he started before Frederic Malle did, but I could be wrong.\nScent twins! I drained the last of my decant of it for today. Need FB!\n One of the first bottles I bought myself when I started leaning in to this hobby. Not as pretty a bottle design as it used to be, but man do I love this scent.\nIt\u2019s been on my FB list for a long time since it was one of the first fragrances I said: I NEED a FB of this. It was one of my first niche scents I tried as well. I think I need to rectify this very soon.\nD<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " could use and how to diffuse them properly.\nCan I Diffuse Fragrance Oils And Perfumes?\nYes, you can diffuse fragrance oils and perfumes, but only if they are oil-based.\nFragrance oils are pretty self-explanatory (though we will discuss them in just a bit), but alcohol-based perfumes do not work well in a diffuser.\nAlcohol-based perfumes may smell divine, but they aren\u2019t so great for our skin or diffuser devices. These kinds of fragrances often have harsh chemicals that can harm our skin (such as strip it of moisture) and cause damage to diffusers.\nAlcohol-based fragrances evaporate quickly, therefore requiring the use of strong, synthetic, and often harmful fixatives. Fixatives help stabilize a fragrance and slow down the evaporation rate in some of the more volatile ingredients in one, allowing only a continuous and gradual change in the aroma as it fades away on your skin.\nFixatives also carry notes throughout the stages of evaporation, so you can continue smelling them as you wear your favorite scent.\nThese synthetic fixatives and the alcohol base in a perfume do not make for a great diffuser experience. By nature, alcohol is highly flammable, so it is advised not to put alcohol-based fragrances and perfumes in your diffuser.\nIf you\u2019ve ever tried to buy alcohol-based perfume online and ship it overseas to you, you\u2019ve probably realized that airmail carriers won\u2019t ship perfumes containing alcohol by plane. It\u2019s too flammable, and the same goes for your scents with the same base.\nGo online, and you\u2019ll find different answers on this one, but furniture industry and home decor experts like Kristina from Letti and Co., mostly agree that fragrance oils are safe to use in your diffuser, so long as you water them down.\nIt should be noted, however, that fragrance oils typically contain carrier oils \u2014 such as coconut oil or Jojoba oil \u2014 for topical purposes. They help \u201ccarry\u201d the scent into the skin when applied.\n\nShould you want to extend the life of your diffuser, you should forgo using fragrance oils or perfumes and stick to essential oils. Essential oils do contain carrier oils, but they are used to help dilute the essential oil mixture, unlike for their topical purpose in fragrance oils to help keep the scent in the skin.\nNow before we go any further, maybe you\u2019re new to fragrance diffusing in general. What is diffusing?\nDiffusing is the process of dispersing essential oils so that the aroma from them fills the entire room with its scent. This is often done with a diffusing device, but sometimes wooden sticks are used to disperse the scent.\nMany people opt to go the more natural route and use essential oils in their diffusers, like lemon, peppermint, eucalyptus, tea tree, rosemary, sage, or grapefruit. These oils are naturally anti-microbial and help keep cold and flu germs away when introduced into the air via a puff of mist from a diffuser.\nDon\u2019t be surprised to find calming oils like lavender, chamomile, and clary sage warming up in people\u2019s diffusers in times of stress. These naturally have a soothing effect, which is why so many people gravitate towards flowery scents \u2013 they\u2019ve been proven to help us feel calm.\nOther individuals, on the other hand (you, perhaps, since you\u2019re reading this article?), like to enjoy their favorite wearable scents in a diffuser.\nIf you do this, make sure that you double-check that your fragrance is not an alcohol-based one (it must be oil-based), and remember to add some water when pouring into the diffuser. At the end of this post, I discuss what oil-based fragrances you could use.\nStop longing for your house to smell like Maison Louis Marie No. 4 Bois de Balincourt or Diptyque Philosykos!\nWhen Should I Clean My Diffuser?\nIt\u2019s suggested that you regularly clean your diffuser regardless of what kind of product you use. However, if you use a fragrance oil or perfume, you\u2019ll want to clean it more often to help sustain the lifespan of the diffuser.\nIt is recommended to clean your diffuser every time it runs out of its scent. Regardless of what product you use, regular cleaning is a good practise. It will keep your diffuser running smoothly and it prevents different scents from mixing.\nOnce you\u2019re finished diffusing the fragrance, ensure that you remove all traces of oil or water inside the device. Regular cleanings prevent the accumulation of water, oil, or minerals left behind on the vibrating disk.\nThe vibration from the disk creates the mist or steam that comes out of your diffuser, dispersing the scent. It\u2019s a critical part of your unit, so do take proper care of it by rinsing and drying everything off once done \u2014 or else you may be spending money on a replacement vibrating disk rather than a new fragrance for your machine.\nNow that you\u2019ve used one of your favorite perfumes or your go-to fragrance oil in your diffuser, you need to clean it to ensure your device keeps working correctly.\nYou can easily make a natural solution using vinegar and warm water for a good clean. It only takes a few hours to do, and most of the time is spent with you getting other things done while the solution is soaking and cleaning in your diffuser\u2019s water container.\nMix 60ml of vinegar (\u00bc cup) with some warm water.\nPour the solution into the water container inside the diffuser.\nLet the solution soak inside the water container for 3 hours. Keep the machine off.\nAfter 3 hours, pour the water out.\nUse a cotton swab to gently rub loose and clean off any build-up on the vibratory disk. Be gentle; you don\u2019t have to use much pressure.\nRinse the diffuser and fill it with clean, cold water.\nPlug the unit back in.\nTurn it on to start the misting process.\nWhat Oil-Based Fragrances And Perfumes Can I Use?\nYou\u2019ve learned about which types of scent forms you can use in your diffuser and how to clean it, but now it\u2019s time to talk about what fragrance oils and perfumes would be suitable for diffusing.\nYou can diffuse any oil-based fragrance you like. Most of the typical fragrances you can buy in a store are alcohol-based, but there are different companies that exlcusively sell oil-based fragrances. These usually come in much smaller bottles, as the oil-based perfumes are much more concentrated.\nThere are also a bunch of companies that recreate popular scents into an oil-based version. This is an easy way for you to still diffuse your personal favorite perfume or cologne.\nThe main rule with diffusing is that as long as it isn\u2019t alcohol-based, you\u2019re good to go!<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " over time as well.\nReally interested in hearing your take on Cartier's Bleu. I know nothing about it. I'm curious to see it reviewed by someone who's in the midst of sampling other well-known and respected vetivers, to sort of see how it compares.\nLast edited by Buysblind; 15th September 2015 at 05:00 PM.\nThanks Buysblind. Vetiver Tonka was actually great for me to try at the beginning because it's such a good scent I had to ask myself, \"Why ISN'T this the one for me?\" and I had to really think about it. It helped teach me a lot about my Vetiver preference and what I look for.\nI actually wore it more yesterday since I didn't have any new ones in yet and I feel even stronger that my review was spot on for me. My wife also was able to smell it more and just kept saying, \"This one smells really good.\" At the end, as I suspected she acknowledged that she found it slightly lacking because it doesn't reach out and grab you and force you to notice it enough for her. It's almost so well blended that nothing stands out and says, \"Look here.\"\nCartier - Vetiver Bleu is going to be an interesting review. I've been wearing it all day and have a good idea what I'm going to say, but I still have to let my wife smell the dry down on it and give her opinion.\nIn other great news, I finally got my BIG order in so for at least the next 3 weeks I should have a new review nearly every day.\n If it were a slut it'd be easy.\nThis was a crazy fragrance to review. I put it on in the morning after getting ready and my first reaction was it reminded me of mouthwash or toothpaste. Also after wearing it for a bit where I sprayed it and especially the top of my hand started to tingle and cool. After about 30 minutes I had the involuntary reaction of trying to wipe it off of the back of hand. It actually startled me so much that I had to read a description of this fragrance to figure out what was going on. When I read the description I realized what was going on. Apparently there is a strong mint note in it. This accounts for the mouthwash/toothpaste scent and the tingling/cooling I felt on my skin.\nTo be clear I don't actually hate the scent as much as my score might lead some to believe. Eventually the mint note does die down some and you do get a kinda green and powdery Vetiver. The problem is the Vetiver doesn't really stand out in any way to me. The entire fragrance really is like that to me. Projection, scent, sillage everything came off to me as average. Not necessarily bad, just average.\nHowever, because of my experience with the mint freaking me out I had to give it a pretty low overall rating. While I don't think the scent is bad, and I did wear it for the entire day - even reapplying in the evening, I honestly cannot think of a time I will ever reach for the fragrance again - ever. If someone wants a minty fresh, clean smelling, slightly powdery fragrance, that might have just a hint of Vetiver in it then give this a try. As I said it is not a \"bad\" fragrance. It's just a bad fragrance for me. Unfortunately, I just couldn't shake the feeling that I was \"taking one for the team\" by wearing this one all day. This might be a case where having no idea what the fragrance is going to smell like actually did it a disservice because I just wasn't prepared to be hit with a mint blast on my skin.\nAm I saying completely avoid it? Not necessarily. Just know what you are getting into.\nThis was one that she felt was completely middle of the road. Not bad, not good. She felt it was ok. Like the others so far she felt this one didn't come off the skin enough to get her attention and her exact words when she smelt it were, \"Yeah.  This just didn't excite her at all.\nNext Fragrance Review: Geurlain - Vetiver Extreme.\nI enjoyed reading yours and your wifes thoughts on Vetiver Tonka, it does sound rather nice with the Tonka rounding off some of the more 'difficult' aspects of the Vetiver. I'm hoping that I may be able to try it the next time I pass through the duty free section at Heathrow, it's either that or ebay.\nLooking forward to the rest of your reviews!\nVetiver qua vetiver, Sycomore is my pick these days. That said, I recently got and love Prada's lively vetiver. But it is a bit too feminine and needs just a bit more vetiver oomph. Hence, I created a decant with apx 2% Encre Noir, 4% Sycomore, and 94% Prada. An interesting experiment. In particular, even the tiniest bit of Sycomore premixed with the Prada produces a marked change.\n@La Fl\u00e2neuse Vetiver Tonka is really nice. I could not see anyone outright hating the fragrance. I don't know about the UK but US eBay has people selling official 4ml samples of it for a pretty good price compared to even full bottles so that could definitely be an option for you. I looked into SL Vetiver Oriental but it seems that there just aren't any reasonable options out there to get a sample of it.\n@Schnozz I've heard a lot about Sycomore. Out of all the fragrances in this game, it might be the one I know the most about because so many people have talked about it and it's apparent similarity to Encre Noire. It will be definitely interesting to try when I pull it out of the bag.\nI play with these two as well. EC can be just a touch rough around the edges and layering it with a little Sycomore rounds out it out a bit. Perhaps the point here is that, if you can't find THE vetiver, they tend layer well and hence can be pushed slightly in one direction or another.\nI have no idea why this is called Vetiver Extreme. To my nose there is nothing extreme about it. When you first spray it you get a blast of alcohol smell for the first 30 seconds or so. While I'm not a big fan of that, I know as alcohol evaporates it helps lift the scent off the skin and I did find this was one of the better performing scents as far as projection I've tested so far (it is by no means a projection beast though). I found during the initial phase - the first hour to two it was about 12 inches off the skin and then slowly went down from there. After the alcohol evaporates some you are left with a green leaf Vetiver scent. In some ways it reminded me of Original Vetiver. The scent came off fresh, a little clean, but also powdery. There was nothing extreme here. It was just a green scent.\nOverall, my takeaway from this fragrance is it is a slightly above average fragrance in performance and scent. Was it stellar and took my breath away? No. But, If I had not smelled any other vetivers I could see it as an alright choice. I see this Vetiver as good for someone who likes Original Vetiver but wants something a bit more powdery. Unfortunately I cannot pull off powdery. It was pleasant and I could see myself reaching for it every once in awhile...BUT...\nMy wife hated this scent. She thought it smelled feminine and too powdery. She kept trying to smell it but everytime was just, \"Ew, no.\" Etc. For a Vetiver scent she didn't find it manly at all and struggled to even rate it. She was completely against it on me, and sadly this is why I will probably never reach for it to wear it, even though I think it's alright.\nInteresting review! I'm also not a fan of that one but I know it has a cult following. Your wife's take was funny :P.\nDay #6: Fragrance - Diptyque Vetyverio.\nMy Ratings: Scent - Good. Overall - Good.\nThis is a good fragrance, however to my nose it is not a Vetiver Fragrance. I get floral notes, oriental notes, and maybe something slightly green. I can't smell anything Vetiver in it. Does that mean it's bad? No. I find the fragrance good but it does tend to skewer unisex and maybe slightly feminine.\nSince I simply don't see this as being a Vetiver cologne I didn't rate it a number and instead just marked it as good. The performance was fine too if not spectacular. I find this cologne would be for someone who definitely wants something unisex and that wants a floral note. I would love it on my wife. It is a very natural smell and I don't get anything synthetic at all. It feels like it was blended very well and the end product was what the designer wanted. I just don't smell Vetiver.\nMy Wife's Rating: Scent - Good.\nWhen she first smelled it she actually asked me if it was a woman's perfume. She agreed it had a floral note and also something powdery about it. She liked the smell, but, she said she could not see me wearing it. The more she smelled it the more on the fence she was about it. She had trouble placing whether it was<|endoftext|>"

I\u2019ll just dump everything I can think of then. \n\n\n**Warmer weather:** \n\n\n1) **Marc Antoine Barrois Ganymede:** I believe this one was made to evoke the moon, and I think it gets that impression bang on. Cold, mineralic, some florals. ZERO citrus or aquatics. Androgynous. A truly unique fresh fragrance, which is difficult to pull off. \n\n\n\n\n2) **Diptyque Philosykos:** evokes a fig tree.

But it\u2019s not juvenile sweetness like you\u2019d expect. No, this is rich, dark, thick, mature. Sweet, yes, but not bubblegummy. This is as far from typical designer sweetness as it gets.

        "passage": "Figuier / Fig / Eau de Figuier is a shared / unisex perfume by Heeley.\nThere are 14 reviews of Figuier / Fig / Eau de Figuier.\nApparently there are only so many things a perfumer can do with the fig accord. You get either a milky, leafy, sap-filled approach, as in Diptyque's Philosykos, or a more fruity, tart version, as in Parfumerie Generale's Jardins de K\u00e9rylos. Heeley's Eau de Figuier falls into the latter bucket. Prominent citrus and floral accents make Jardins de K\u00e9rylos more complex and interesting to my nose, but if you're looking for a straightforward, crisp, fruity fig scent, Eau de Figuier might be just the thing for you.\n\nThis fragrance did the same thing to me!\nVery natural and extremely high quality fig based fragrance that stays figgy all the time and fortunately it doesn't get coconuty!\nThe opening is a bitter green figgy smell with some sort of salty aquatic vibe.\nThe fig note here doesn't smell like ripe fruit which is sweet and tasty. actually it's more like green unriped figs while they are still on the tree.\nWhen you pick the unriped figs out of the branch some sort of white sap comes out and if you smell it, it has a mineral feeling into it. the scent has that feeling as well.\nI can feel a soft salty aquatic feeling and a bitter herbal aroma beside figs too which makes the scent more green and fresh and also more natural.\nThe scent is not sweet. it's watery, figgy and fruity almost without sweetness. it has a resinous mineral feeling and finally it's a little salty and bitter green.\n\nIn the mid that salty and bitter herbal feelings are almost gone and while I can still smell the green figs, very smooth sweetness joins the scent.\nThe sweetness is very soft and it's not even creamy.\nThere is a little bit of woods but completely in the background.\nProjection is average and longevity is around 5-6 hours on my skin which is very good for this kind of scent.\nI haven't tested too many fig based fragrance but this is definitely the best.\nA great choice for summer and something very different from those citrusy summery scents that you can smell it everywhere on anybody during the summer!\nA bravura recreation of fig foliage, which opens sharp and solvent-like but settles quickly into rain-drenched, sappy green leaves that makes me feel at ease and one with nature. The scent is thinner than other green fig recreations without the usual coconut undertones, but with vegetal, almost green chili pepper notes that offer a different dimension. Not a fig leaf to hide behind but one that seems to prompt one to slip into the greenery in the altogether.\nWhile other fig perfumes work by concentration, this, while possibly being closer to nature, may even strike one as being not quite how we remember fig. Over the course of the wear we move from the leaves closer to the wood. While this takes Figuier into more traditional territory, it also makes it more rewarding as a perfume, because the opening and middle stage seem better suited to scenting rooms than skin.\nI've been searching for a good fig and have so far tried Marc Jacobs, Philosykos, L'Artisan Premier Figuier Extreme, and Lutens' Bois et Fruits (no fig here to my nose).\nWhat sets this one apart is the sweetness. If fig leaves are stoic and sharp, this is a smoother, more wearable, and classier version. It would work well with a suit and tie.\nHeeley's website says this: \"Fig essence does<|endoftext|>"

Created to embody the \u2018modern woman\u2019, it balances notes of black rose with nutmeg and black pepper \u2013 sophisticated, feminine and every bit as cool as Anine herself.\nDiffusers don\u2019t come much more stylish than this. Designed to sit on the wall, Diptyque\u2019s new launch is simple and sophisticated, allowing you to scent a large space with their bestselling fragrances. Just slot in one of their clever inserts \u2013 which contain beads saturated with scent. It makes for a beautiful gift, too \u2013 for yourself or a friend.\nBitter Peach may not sound all that synonymous with winter, but the fruity notes are tempered slightly by blood orange and rum-infused oils. Meanwhile, patchouli adds a hint more musk, too. At first spritz, it feels light and citrus-y, but as it dries down, you\u2019ll soon see how it develops into something much cosier. Different to other Tom Ford perfumes, we predict this will be a huge hit.\nCar diffusers just got a whole lot chicer again \u2013 this time, thanks to Jo Malone. The clever design of their car diffuser allows you to attach them to your air vent, and comes filled with one of the brand\u2019s three signature fragrances \u2013 Lime, Basil & Mandarin, Peony & Blush Suede or Wood Sage & Sea Salt. The scent is potent, too, so you get proper bang for your buck, without it being too overpowering. A great gift for anyone this Christmas.\nWhen it comes to self-tanning, our motto is 'the easier the better', which explains why we\u2019re loving Vogue Williams mists. Available in light, medium and dark, the pump makes it easy to ramp up your tan without worrying about overdoing it. Simply spray over your face for a light, gradual glow that builds up over a few hours. Added oatmeal and chamomile means skin gets a hydrating boost, too, while antioxidants combat redness caused by pollution or UV.\nWe found this niche deodorant brand this year via wholesale marketplace site Curate Beauty and have been huge fans ever since. Aluminium-free and antibacterial, each one is made with a crisp, fresh scent that belies any stigma surrounding natural formulas. Unlike others on the market, they don\u2019t wear off quickly and there\u2019s zero powdery residue left behind. We love the chic packaging, too.\nHydrating body oils don\u2019t get much better than this. Luxurious and thick in texture, it glides over the skin with a moisture-rich formula. Cold-pressed hazelnut oil (which is rich in fatty acids) and organic botanical oils keep dryness and irritation at bay, while ensuring limbs stay supple and velvety-soft. Despite its unguent consistency, it sinks in fast, with zero greasy residue left behind. The orange blossom scent adds an uplifting feel, too.\nIt can be hard to get excited about something like a razor, but we love cool brand Estrid. It works as a monthly subscription that starts from \u00a37.95, however, you can choose how often you want new blades, so you\u2019re never forced to overspend. Available in four Instagram-worthy shades, each razor uses aloe vera and vitamin E to nourish and moisturise, while the weighted steel handle has a rubber underside for a steady grip. What\u2019s more, for every razor you buy, Estrid donates a portion to Kvinna till Kvinna \u2013 a Swedish organisation supporting women\u2019s rights in more than 20 conflict-ridden countries.\nPromising effective results without compromising the environment, Biossance is completely recyclable, cruelty-free and uses 100% plant-based ingredients. Our favourite from the range is this does-it-all oil which can be used on the body, the face and even as a soothing shave oil. Formulated with squalane, just a few drops massaged into the skin will encourage speedier cell turnover, boost elasticity and add extra moisture. It\u2019s lightweight too, so it works well when blended with a foundation for a dewy finish.\nCult brand Sol de Janeiro have added to their body care line with this heavy-duty scrub. Brimming with sugar and salt, it feels like rubbing sand onto your skin, but in the most satisfying way. Making light work of dead skin cells, dry patches and red bumps, it quickly lends a softening, silky boost, while cupua\u00e7u butters help to firm skin over time. Plus, the signature summer scent is guaranteed to transport you to the nearest beach.\nWe love this new SPF brand, which has made its way over from California. Aiming to create formulas that are safe for everyone to use \u2013 especially children \u2013 the products are full of vitamin E to strengthen and protect, while the creams, sprays and blocks cover all individual protection needs. This spray is our favourite \u2013 by covering a wide surface area, it offers optimum protection. What\u2019s more, the whole range is reef friendly, meaning they don\u2019t bleach the corals. Plus, the coconut, banana scent is heaven.\nFoaming shower gels are everywhere right now, and this one from Rituals is our favourite of 2020. On first pump, the formula dispenses as a milky oil, but soon foams up into a satisfying lather. Not only is the scent divine, it also works to deeply hydrate and nourish parched limbs with botanical extracts. Use it with your razor for a snag-free shave.\nNew brand, The Solution, dropped at Superdrug this year and it\u2019s seriously good. Affordable and efficacious, we can\u2019t get enough of their Salicylic Acid (SA) Body Gel, which uses salicylic to gently exfoliate and buff away dead, dry patches of skin. Ideal for those suffering with bumps or under-the-skin spots, it quickly softens limbs while absorbing fast with zero sticky residue. Added niacinamide counteracts any harsh effects, too, keeping inflammation to a minimum.\nErgonomically designed, this no-mess body scrub has been designed to fit comfortably in your hand for a gentle, but effective exfoliation. Packed with finely milled biodegradable bamboo powder to buff dead skin cells with ease, it leaves behind a softer surface area immediately. Keep one in the shower and by the bath so you\u2019re never without. We simply can\u2019t get enough of the aesthetically pleasing pink bar and the cult \u2018Glossier\u2019 embossing \u2013 brilliant for those seeking eco-friendly body care alternatives, too.\nWe\u2019ve mentioned our love for fuss-free, efficacious skincare brand CeraVe before, and now, they\u2019re adding a rich foot cream to their cult line. Just like everything else the brand has launched, it\u2019s brimming with nourishing ceramides to keep dryness at bay, while salicylic acid removes bumps and stubborn dry skin without irritation. For best results, use a generous amount before bed, popping on some lightweight socks to lock in the formula overnight. You\u2019ll notice how conditioned and soft they feel in the morning, thanks to a healthy dose of hyaluronic acid.\nCreated for those who prefer a gradual tan, Dove\u2019s Body Mousse works over a few days to build realistic-looking colour that lasts. With a stain-free formula, apply it and sleep in it \u2013 you still won\u2019t see any remnants of dark, orange streaks on your bedding. The best bit is you can completely control the colour: apply a few pumps for just a hint of tan or layer it up over a couple of days for a deeper, vacation-like glow. Ideal for tanning novices.<|endoftext|>"

From heritage candle-making brands like Cire Trudon to designer offerings from Gucci, Louis Vuitton, and Dior to minimalist must-haves from Byredo, diptyque, Le Labo, Boy Smells, Overose, and more\u2014read on for the best scents to elevate your space.\nPerhaps best known for its ubiquitous Santal 33 scent, Le Labo\u2019s perfumed candles are a chic addition to any home, particularly those who favor timeless, minimal interior aesthetics. The NYC-based brand launched in 2006 and has since gone on to be one of the most coveted\u2014and instantly recognizable\u2014fragrance brands.\nLe Labo has 18 core scents in its home and personal fragrance categories, as well as limited-edition \u201ccity\u201d exclusives, occasionally released in the specific cities they\u2019re named after.\nLe Labo candles are made from soy-based wax and a pure cotton wick and are all hand-poured in Mississippi. We particularly love Verveine 23, a blend of eucalyptus, galbanum, violet leaves and kaffir lime with floral and woody notes. For those who prefer fresh yet warm scents, Palo Santo 14 is a must-have\u2014 it\u2019s built around Palo Santo but with elements of cedarwood, labdanum, incense, and patchouli.\nIf you can\u2019t get enough of the aforementioned Santal 33, the Santal 26 is a divine addition to the home and it\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9-approved\u2014the artist notably burned two of these on her 2016 visual album Lemonade. It\u2019s also a personal favorite of Athena Calderone\u2019s. \u201cThis scent is what I burn in my Brooklyn townhouse in the evenings after dinner; it really sets the tone as a transition for the day to unwind,\u201d she shares.\nFounded by Ben Gorham in Stockholm in 2006, Byredo has evolved from its initial offering of perfumes to candles, hand and body products, leather goods, and accessories.\nThis brand is a favorite for minimalists thanks to its black glass vessel and sleek branding, designed by renowned creative agency MM, along with a signature black wax. Woods is a great scent for bringing a touch of the outdoors, inside. With a white cedarwood and ambroxan base and notes of jasmine petals, Tuscan leather, and raspberry, it\u2019s a fresh breath of forest air.\nSafran is ideal for people who have a penchant for spicier notes\u2014it boasts strong, sensual elements like dark amber, patchouli, labdanum, leather accord, black pepper and saffron. For a sweet hit of childhood nostalgia, look toward Tree House with its notes of leather, myrrh, bamboo and pimento.\nWhile a monogrammed Louis Vuitton bag may be top of the wish-list for many, the Parisian luxury brand is also a purveyor of high-end home goods, designed to elevate any home. Housed within a chic white holder with subtle Louis Vuitton text embossing, a monogrammed gold-tone lid, leather handle and hand-painted braided cotton wick, these candles truly exude luxury. \u00cele Blanche, which translates to \u201cwhite island,\u201d has notes of fresh tea, jasmine sambac, orange, citronnella, verbena, neroli and cardamom, which blend to produce an aroma that instantly transports you to a breezy, sunny island vacation.\nFor a more powerful fragrance, Feuilles D\u2019or features hints of geranium, Indonesian patchouli, Virginian cedar, incense and Peruvian balsam, bringing to mind beguiling tropical forests. If you\u2019re looking for a more subtle scent inspired by the great outdoors, L\u2019air Du Jardin smells like a literal rose garden in springtime.\nChristian Dior candles make for an excellent gift for that person in your life who truly has everything\u2014their understated yet undeniably elegant pieces add a touch of luxury to any space. For summer, we love the peach-toned Jardin D\u2019organgers with its hits of neroli flowers and fresh-cut citrus. Bois Brul\u00e9 however, reminds us of fall thanks to its deep, smoky aroma reminiscent of cozy log fires.\nDiehard Dior fans may be more inclined to reach toward 30 Montaigne. This particular fragrance was created by Hedi Slimane during his tenure as creative director at Dior Homme specifically to scent Dior\u2019s flagship Parisian store, which it\u2019s named after.\nFornasetti candles will add character to any living space and act as an inevitable conversation starter. Founded in the 1950s by sculptor, graphic artist, and interior designer Piero Fornasetti, the eponymous brand is focused on homeware.\nThese are unsurprisingly like works of art themselves considering the ornate ceramic vessels they live within, which can be repurposed long after the wax has all burned. Our top picks for every chic home include the Cocktail candle (adorned with cocktail graphics inspired by the founder\u2019s drawings from the \u201950s) scented with Fornasetti\u2019s smoky 'Otto' aroma that's infused with notes of Thyme, Lavender, and Cedarwood, the pop art-style Rossetti with hints of orange blossom, lily, and sandalwood, and the floral Ortensia candle, which boasts delicate hits of white rose and jasmine.\nAn influencer and celebrity favorite, there\u2019s no doubt you will have seen aesthetic lifestyle imagery of diptyque candles all over your social media feeds.\nFor something even more floral, there\u2019s Mimosa\u2014named not for the cocktail but the delicate golden-yellow flower. Some people are drawn to more intense, smoky aromas for which we recommend Feu de Bois which smells just like a warm, crackling log fire.\nMade in Los Angeles by fashion industry veterans Matthew Herman and David Kien, Boy Smells is known for its Instagrammable millennial pink and black packaging. This brand is so much more than just a dreamy aesthetic though.\nKnown mostly for its somewhat controversial debut candle, which is fragranced with cannabis, Boy Smells currently has 14 permanent scents in its roster, as well as occasional limited-edition releases like Slow Burn, made in collaboration with musician Kacey Musgraves.\nOur favorites at the moment include the dark yet floral Cinderose, and Cedar Stack with its notes of cedar chips and dried tobacco cut with labdanum, juniper berries and peppercorn. NYC dwellers may be more compelled to reach for LES\u2014with its blend of peach blossom, jasmine rice, cardamom and white cedar, this invigorating scent will take you right to the Lower East Side\u2019s bustling, multi-cultural streets.\nLa DoubleJ candles are perfect for anyone whose home decor tastes are a little more on the eclectic side. The Milanese brand is known for it\u2019s vibrant prints which take pride of place on these porcelain vessels, which all feature an 18k gold trim.\nEach of our selections below include notes of frankincense, ylang ylang and labdanum, for a fragrance that\u2019s at once calming and cozy. We can\u2019t get enough of the offbeat patterns, however, especially the blue floral Wildbird which can be repurposed once the wax is all gone.\nBritish designer Tom Dixon is known for his sleek and striking home objects, which he\u2019s cunningly incorporated into his candles. Eclectic Alchemy, with its black metal finish, has a musky fragrance with hints of black pepper, patchouli, and guaiac wood. To contrast, Elements Air comes in a simple mouth-blown glass vessel and incorporates pink pepper and orange flower in its captivating, crisp, and light aroma. Grab the whole Elements set for a little bit of everything.\nWe particularly love the Royalty candle, which is inspired by everything we miss about traveling across the pond: \"a pot of Earl Grey, scones, strawberry jam, and the drive home in a '52 Bentley with tatty leather seats.\" Light it, and you\u2019ll immediately fall for the notes of fresh Lemon and Bergamot grounded by Verbena, Mint, and Cedar Wood.\nLondon-based designer Bella Freud is well-known for her stylish, slogan-emblazoned knits and she\u2019s applied her trademark touch to scented candles that are sure to add a chic and cheeky edge to your home.\nHer signature 1970 marker is seen here in metallic gold, which focuses on strong, heady<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "k\u2019 base.\nPersonally, I find Ol\u00e8ne to be somewhat lacking in complexity, but then again I doubt that was its goal to begin with. Ol\u00e8ne, which was released in 1988, marks the beginning of the transition from the early Diptyques such as L\u2019Eau and L\u2019Autre, which were quirky little spice bombs, to the most recent releases by Diptyque, which have gone down the road of rendering various fragrance categories in a sheer, translucent style (Volutes = sheer honey gourmand; Vetyverio = sheer vetiver; L\u2019Eau Duelle = sheer woody vanilla; anything from the recent L\u2019Eau series = sheer floral). As it is, Ol\u00e8ne makes for a narcotic, dewy-fresh, and relatively clean white floral, but I would hesitate to describe it as sheer. Unlike Philosykos, which was groundbreaking in its rendition of the fig tree, Ol\u00e8ne doesn\u2019t shatter the earth with its originality (although I may be being unfair to it, seeing as how it was created in 1988 \u2013 rose and violet soliflores were certainly commonplace by that time, being staples of Victorian England, but perhaps jasmine soliflores weren\u2019t; I\u2019m not as familiar with perfume history as I ought to be, and I apologise for that). Then again, neither does the rest of the Diptyque line, which often make for pretty, wearable, uncomplicated perfumes.\nBut if you\u2019re looking to turn heads, without wearing actual jasmine flowers in your hair, then Ol\u00e8ne would be perfect.\nHey Vanessa! I do think there are similarities between Oy\u00e9do, Ofr\u00e9sia and Ol\u00e8ne\u2026 Their names certainly seem to suggest so. Perhaps they make up Diptyque\u2019s trio of white florals?\nI do think it\u2019s sweet, but it doesn\u2019t come anywhere near the sweetness of Lust, which adds a vanillic syrupy-ness to jasmine. But the sweetness of Ol\u00e8ne is reminiscent of the flower itself, which can sometimes be cloying.\nI\u2019m okay with death by jasmine. There are worse ways to go. I love jasmine so I\u2019ll have to remember this one. I haven\u2019t had a chance to sniff much from this line. I did get a bottle of Eau Lente in a swap which smells like Old Spice on steroids to me. I really need to make a point of sniffing out the ones everyone is always talking about.\nOoh yes definitely check this out if you\u2019re ok with death by jasmine. I do think it will bloom remarkably in the current heat we\u2019re having.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " Christmas in a bottle, or a summer walk in the southern pine forest I grew up in. Pine is an ultimate comfort scent to me Bc of my childhood, but most of the \u201cmasculine\u201d scents that use it are too brawny for me. Cedarwood is a favorite basenote, but I don\u2019t have anything that dries down to JUST the wood.\nOnWingsofSaffron: Serge Lutens, Bois de Violette: cederwood and violets, quite beautiful. I wore this a year long. But now for the timebeing I\u2019ve put it aside.\nBela: After years of only wearing Serge Lutens fragrances, I finally got tired of the lack of interesting drydowns so I broke away and reconnected with a perfume I\u2019d had a love-hate relationship for many years \u2013 Aromatics Elixir. I was very happy wearing it for several months and then I fell in love with Guerlain Santal Royal. I bought it more or less straight away; I didn\u2019t research the composition; I didn\u2019t read any reviews or anything; I just started wearing it, and I\u2019m in heaven.\nBela: You will probably find it a bit too \u2018simple\u2019, V. It\u2019s not niche; it\u2019s Guerlain and an oud/wood for \u2018grande consommation\u2019, but I\u2019m so happy to have found something I like from top to toe, as it were. Serge should care a bit more about his drydowns: they are boring, imo.\nSylvia: I agree- it\u2019s one of the reasons I am hoping for some recommendations that are more affordable. SL is ridiculously expensive. I found my. It\u2019s at a discounted at half price- only way it was moderately priced.\nBela: So sorry, Sylvie: thought I was replying to Victoria (it did surprise me that she hadn\u2019t tested Santal Royal yet, but\u2026 LOL!).\nIt\u2019s nice that the perfumer still uses real oakmoss in some scents.\nSince you mentioned affordable pleasures, I\u2019ll give a wave to Mountain Rose Herbs aromatherapy sprays. They\u2019re not traditional perfumes by any means, but I think they\u2019re exceptionally nice herbal scents. A few of them use wood oils (sandalwood, cedar, cypress).\nI especially like using them as sheet sprays.\nSylvia: I was surprised by how much I like sandalwood. I tried the sandalwood soap that you reviewed Victoria, and fell in love! So glad it\u2019s so economical to buy. It brought a scent memory up that I couldn\u2019t make sense out of. We lived in Hawaii in my childhood for awhile and The soap made me think about that house- and oddly the closets. My brother cleared up the mystery. Dad had placed sandalwood sachets in the closets to ward off moths. The lovely smell was in everything.\nThat led me to trying a number of sandalwood scents. My current favorite is Santal Majuscule sprayed on clothing. The scent wafting up off of my shirts takes me back to that peCeful happy family time in such lovely country.\nLydia: What a lovely memory, Sylvia!\nzephyr: Spe and Jessiferica, in an attempt to break out of my \u201csame old stuff\u201d perfume rut, I visited Merz Apothecary a few neighborhoods over from my house here in Chicago. Chicago people take note \u2013 they\u2019ve expanded and have a huge selection of niche fragrances, and they sell samples! Tanja helped me and a friend, and she knows what she\u2019s talking about!\nMarti: Creed Spice and Wood, for me, is an excellent fresh, balanced fragrance.\nAlso very long lasting but not overpowering.\nI\u2019m wearing today L\u2019ether from Iunx, a beautiful incense intertwined with rose and saffron. I\u2019m asking myself if you could classify an incense like this as a woody scent.\nTati: I find many woods difficult to wear. Although I love vanilla, I find SL\u2019s Bois Vanille too harsh. Diptyque\u2019s Tam Dao is all pencil shavings on me. My favorites, though, are among my most worn scents. I find them very natural and calming. CDG\u2019s Kyoto is always right. Another favorite is 10 Corso Como. Chanel Coromandel is perfection in a bottle.\nAustenfan: I dutifully ( \ud83d\ude09 ) first read your \u2018extra reading post\u2019 before rereading this one.\nI struggle with woods, especially with what Robin of NST calls wood-puddings, but can mostly handle dry woody compositions quite well.\nMy current favourite cedar heavy perfume is the divine Bois d\u2019Encens. And I never would have guessed there is any cedar in Chant d\u2019Ar\u00f4mes.\nSHMW: I have seen tips that say try not to inhale too much of the just sprayed OW edp until it settles down or spray on the body \u2026. but I agree with you. I find the sandalwood both spectacular and very very front and centre too.\nSandalwood is hands down my favourite ever since my grandmother brought me back a sandalwood fan from Asia when I was a little girl.\nI\u2019m afraid once again I will sound like a retired English colonel but anyway: when I was in India I bought sandalwood oil in Mysore. Due to the restrictions, I\u2019m not sure how original it is but it has a distinctive chocolate sweet woody aroma I cannot get enough of.\nSurbhi: I will share a little story.\nOn my recent trip to India, I went to Mysore. I took a trip to a factory that produces sandalwood oil. The area just smell amazing.\nThe trees take about 20-30 years before they are ready for oil production. Un-matured tree if cut is a waste. The wood is chopped into pieces and then finely powdered. It goes through steam distillation and the left over wood powder (after oils is extracted) is used for incense. Not a single piece goes to waste.\nLydia: Surbhi, that sounds so lovely, especially to be in an area so saturated with scent.\nLydia: I was very happy to see this topic because wood incense scents are my favorite of all perfumes. It\u2019s so nice to see people reflecting on their favorites.\nI tried White again for the first time in years and it was as compelling as I remembered. It started with a sour note which quickly expanded into Japanese incense and cinnamon, eventually drying down into a lovely wood scent. It smelled so perfectly balanced \u2013 nothing was wanting, no note went wrong. It\u2019s a strange scent \u2013 the wood has an almost urinous, sweaty sharpness at times, but the incense smooths it out, and there\u2019s an elusive floral note that peeks out for a few seconds and then retreats again.\nQuarzazate is pure, soothing japanese incense and wood. It settles into my skin like wearing a gorgeous old sweater made out of warm, autumn colored yarns, spattered with spice. Both White and Quarzazate settle into my skin, as though they were custom made for it, or as though they were magnifying a scent already there.\nLydia: (LOL I just realized it sounded like I thought it was nice that \u201cI\u201d was reflecting on my favorites. I meant that I love hearing about everyone elses favorite wood scents.\nSilverMoon: I like the warm and cozy wood notes like sandalwood and myrrh. I\u2019m less fond of the colder and scratcchy ones like cedar. Among my favourite are Bois des Iles and Ormond Jayne Woman. Also really like Feminite de Bois. Others have mentioned these and I can only agree they are special and beautiful.\nThank you for the article and the comments.\nIn my environment I smell \u201cwood\u201d in white tea and clothes made by linen.\nThese days, while walking in the park, I get close to the trees and smell their trunk! Fig trees, orange trees, are the ones that have a stronger smell for me. And there are many others that I haven\u2019t experienced yet. I\u2019ll go on with the exploration.\nI think all the perfumes I already have aren\u00b4t strong in wood. The other day I was give a sample of Tenue de Soir\u00e9e of Annick Goutal. Patchouli and iris, I was told. As I am exploring Iris it took my attention. It leaves, on my skin, something hard \u2013 it is like saying \u201cthis is the boundary I have chosen\u201d. And, on top of it, an open sensuality, as sweet as sharp.<|endoftext|>"

Whether you're looking for tasty treats or skincare surprises, there's a range of advent calendars that no longer cater simply for your sweet tooth.\nIf you're happy to splurge, here are the best luxury advent calendars in the business.\n30 Avenue Montaigne, Dior's iconic Parisian boutique, is depicted surrounded by a magic garden on the latest edition of the brand's beauty advent calendar (pictured top).

If you want to keep the sheerness but add a little buzz of incense, try L'Artisan Passage d'Enfer. Another great incense layering agent (and a bargain to boot) is Crazylibellule & The Poppies Encens Mystic.\nWhen I want something to be greener than it is (and I often do), I add a dab of the (tragically discontinued) Gobin Daude Sous Le Buis. When my stash of Sous Le Buis runs out, I'm planning to kill myself.\nCB I Hate Perfume Burning Leaves + Gathering Apples makes a lovely fall combination, and it might be the only apple scent I can tolerate. Over at Perfume Posse, they are very fond of using Burning Leaves or CB Musk as layering agents.\nMany people like to layer other fragrances over basic musks. I do this sometimes with Body Time Egyptian Musk, and as that one is such a thick oil, it has the added bonus of extending the lasting power of whatever I layer on top of it.\nA final note: not everything smells good together. If need be, consult How to remove fragrance from skin.\nLayering Tip: Write down successful combos. You think you'll remember, but after the drunken drydown, who knows?\nAnother Tip: Get someone else to tell you what you smell like before venturing out, if you care about that sort of thing. 1+1 can be 1,000 in perfume math. I've been mightily pleased inside the eye of some sillage tornadoes that nearly knocked my usually tolerant sweetie over as he crossed the front door threshold.\nSeriously, writing it down is great advice. Most of my best layering combos have been by accident (I forget I already have something on, or I'm decanting a bunch of stuff) and then I forget them.\nOh I have to laugh, logging on and seeing this, as I don't know what fit came over me this morning\u2026.first I spritzed YSL Paris, and then felt like having some winter warmth instead of Parisian spring and so spritzed Guerlains Double Vanille\u2014it was more of a lazy gesture than a considered pairing, but the two have not stopped arguing all morning and I have a headache!\nLOL \u2014 that is the 1+1=1000 mentioned above, I think!\nOh, you guys, I've got a million ideas \u2014 xcept I don't remember any of them!!! Actually, I do have some of the most successful combos written down and stuck in my basket of fragrances in my fridge, but I'm at work. Awww. I can say that, in the same way that something vanilla-y and sweet, as Robin said, can help certain scents warm up, I find that something like L'Occitane Orange Leaves \u2014 verrrrry green but not harsh \u2014 can tone down some of the frags I've acquired that, on their own, are just a little sweeter than I'm in the mood for. I love layering! It's creative, hands-on, and it really expands my fragrance wardrobe without costing an extra cent! When I first smelled Midnight Poison last week, I wanted it, but didn't want to spend the bucks, so I spritzed from a sample on one hand, and concocted a \u201cphoney\u201d on the other with Essents patchoili, amber, Chance and...oh, what did I use for the rose?...Anyway, it was delicious! Not exactly a knock-off, but in the ballpark. I use SL Santal Blanc to woody-up things, SL Un Bois Vanille to sweeten and warm...very successful, in particular, with anything orange-y.\nI don't know why I never use SLs to layer \u2014 I know they encourage it at the SL counters, but for some reason I don't ever think of it. Un Bois Vanille w/ something orange sounds great. And kudos for making your own Midnight Poison!\nI find most Lutens so overwhelming in terms of the amount of attention they require from me that it's difficult to think about adding to them \u2014 enough is enough, or something like that. I tend to think of layering scents as simpler (and cheaper). But I bet they're great \u2013Victoria P. recommends several combos and I bow to her wisdom.\nThat might be my issue too \u2014 they aren't simple to begin with.\nBefore I will eat: I once layered Un Jardin Sur Le nil with Kelly Caleche. Did that on purpose not because it seemed like a good idea but because both fragrances last too short to my taste.\nAnyway, my hand smelled overwhelmingly sahweet sweet, and it lasted more than the 'usual' four hours. Wouldn't do it again.\nAh, haven't tried that combo. I can see how it might be too much!\nOne of my favorite combos is McQueen's Kingdom and SL Santal de Mysore. Kingdom is perfect as is\u2026but if I want to butch it up, I add the Santal de Mysore. I think that combining works best when the primary notes are the same or at least similar. I often find that combining with other scents from the same house seem to be a safe bet\u2026like Eau du Sud and Eau d'Hadrien or L'eau de L'Artisan and Primier Figuier. I find that L'eau de L'Artisan blends well with a lot of things\u2026.\nWell, R., who knows if my mock-Midnight would have Poisoned anyone in the vicinity, tee-hee! Perhaps it was horrible. (My fledgling experimentation is safest done in solitude!) But for me, it was very satisfying. I think, as someone who's newer to fragrance than so many who contribute to your site, layering \u2014 disasters and all \u2014 is a good way to get to understand fragrances better, by having to really think about what they are individually. Great idea for a topic, Robin, and interested to pick up some truly inspired ideas from others today.\nKingdom + Santal Mysore must be BOLD \u2014 I can only imagine!\nAdore L'Eau de L'Artisan but never layered it, I think when I want it jazzed up I just wear Navegar. Will have to experiment.\nNever thought about layering that way \u2014 as a way to understand fragrances better \u2014 but I'm sure you're right.\nRobin, I need to re-visit Navegar. I haven't smelled it since it came out and I have heard it mentioned several times recently. Hmmm, I wonder if it is destiny and I am supposed to own it?\nI have also had some tragic experiments that were scrubbers\u2026in fact, most are scrubbers. I think that is why I am convinced that I should leave perfumery to the experts!\nHave yet to smell Rahat Loukoum. I don't believe it's here in Vancouver. I know how you've said Louve doesn't hold a candle to it, and it's frustrating I had to buy the runner-up. By the way, I love your phrase about being in the eye of your self-made fragrance tornedo!!!\nThat is ahtx's phrase, see the comment above!\nNavegar seems to be built on L'Eau de L'Artisan's base \u2014 take out some of the citrus & grassy notes, add some peppery spices and you have Navegar. Can't remember now if Navegar is one of the ones that got discontinued though? Or maybe only in the small size.\nYep, all my best layering combos have been accidents! I admit I end up \u201clayering\u201d more often because I'm anxious to try yet another scent than as a deliberate effort to combine the two.\nI have discovered that spraying, say, one arm with \u201cA\u201d and the other arm with \u201cB\u201d is my favorite effect. I can smell both frags together in the air, but can sniff them separately on my skin if I want to. As you note, I'm enjoying Burning Leaves with vanilla.\nI have tried to layer Mitsouko a number of times and have (barely) lived to regret it. Mitsouko does not appreciate being layered.\nI was once craving an incensy carnation scent, so I layered Comme des Garcons Avignon with Bellodgia.\nI have not tried the CB Musk layered yet, but Burning Leaves really is perfect for layering.\nWould never have thought of it, but hey, that does sound good!\nI looooooove layering! It's the budget perfumista's way to play. Today, I wanted to smell like soap-with-a-kick, so I layered Rive Gauche Intense with Jo Malone Honeysuckle Jasmine, and it's perfect.\nThose are really great rec<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "When we think of how perfumes are created, we may imagine an apothecary-type set-up where perfumers in white lab coats sniff dozens of essential oils to arrive at the best scents. While this scenario could still be true for small-batch artisanal fragrance houses, bigger manufacturers like Firmenich rely on more than just oils and test tubes to develop their scents.\nA large part of Firmenich\u2019s success is its extensive library of digital innovations such as recently-launched Scentmate \u2014 an AI-enabled platform that streamlines and simplifies perfume co-creation to deliver winning fragrance solutions for its clients. Using 50 years of fragrance data, Scentmate recommends the best perfumer-curated fragrance solutions, shortening into minutes a process that previously took weeks. Samples arrive within 48 hours, and orders are fulfilled in under five days.\nFounded in Geneva, Switzerland, 125 years ago, Firmenich is the world\u2019s largest privately-owned company in the fragrance and flavour industry, with a turnover of $6.29 billion (as at June 2021). Its business is focused on three key areas: perfumery, ingredients and taste, all backed by world-class science and innovation from its R&D centres around the world.\nFrom your cereal or coffee in the morning, to your shampoo, detergent, shower gel or eau de parfum, Firmenich has helped to scent and flavour some of the world\u2019s most desirable brands, which touch over four billion consumers daily across more than 100 markets. They include the likes of L\u2019oreal Elseve, Dove, Comfort, Ajax, and Palmolive, for consumer brands; as well as Kate Spade, Issey Miyake, Hugo Boss, Chloe, Diptyque, Gucci, Bulgari, and Yves Saint Laurent, for fine fragrances.\nGlobally, about a quarter of its 10,000 employees are involved in the innovation process, from discovering and producing good smell and taste molecules to the application work to ensure that the products perform well. Customers benefit from a palette of over 2,000 ingredients, from natural sourcing of Rose Centifolia Pays in Grasse and Red Fruit Naturome in Scotland, using state-of-the-art technologies including CO2 extraction (SFE) and white biotechnology to develop renewable and sustainable molecules designed with green chemistry principles.\n\u201cSound scientific discoveries and novel technological inventions are the engine for our businesses\u2019 long-term growth. Our R&D scientists are in charge of creating high potency fragrance and flavour ingredients, performing and differentiating technologies such as encapsulation, and creating knowledge and AI tools for our flavourists and perfumers,\u201d explains Dr Dong-Fang Chen, vice president of R&D in Asia Pacific.\nAs a testament to how talented and highly-skilled Firmenich\u2019s scientists are, one of its research consultants, David MacMillan, has just won the 2021 Nobel Prize for chemistry.\nFirmenich is shaping the future of fragrance and taste, and Asia is where its continuous push for scientific excellence and focus on supporting customers with data-driven insights can find its best application in everything, from immunity-boosting taste solutions to health-conscious products in the area of sugar and salt reduction.\nHere, Options finds out more from Levenza Toh, vice president of perfumery for Asia, about changing consumer trends in Asia and the importance of AI.\nWhat are some of the challenges you face today?\nThe macroeconomic slowdown caused by Covid and changing customer behaviours are the biggest challenges. Our first priority was, and remains, the safety of our colleagues, as well our customers and communities. We were fast out the gate to implement extensive health and safety precautions at our sites across the world, to ensure we could continue to play our role within the global food and hygiene value chain.\nGetting used to the new normal and turning challenges into opportunities are crucial to driving our business and serving Firgood, launched in June 2021, is a patented process which enables the biomass processing of 100% natural ingredients obtained by a sustainable proprietary extraction technology our customers. With science as our engine of growth, we are harnessing our innovation leadership in key areas, from sustainable solutions for nutrition, health and hygiene, to climate change and biodiversity. We will also continue to invest in digitalisation, e-commerce and AI to enhance our capabilities and speed-to-market.\nWe\u2019re truly amid a revolution. We have become smarter and more consumer-focused than ever. FY2021 saw our biggest investment ever in consumer research, not only for product testing but also for deeper research in global consumer sentiment. We have run three large-scale global surveys through each phase of the pandemic. We are using data science to drive innovation, new technology and new creative solutions, and we developed new customer platforms to serve the needs of small or mid-sized customers, whose digital business models mean they may produce fewer quantities of fragrance, but develop dynamic and expansive products more quickly.\nWhat trends do you see taking root in Asia?\nWhat a product does matters, more<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " so you don't need to love rose fragrances to wear Iroaz; in fact, if you're looking for a real springtime rose scent, you'd do better with something like Diptyque Eau Rose or Parfums DelRae Coup de Foudre. Instead, Iroaz could be categorized with Les Parfums de Rosine Ecume de Rose (although it's more transparent and less ambery) or Dawn Spencer Hurwitz's Beach Roses (which includes notes of rose with sandalwood, palmarosa, lemon, and lily). One note that never appears in Iroaz when I wear it, despite its mention in the Lostmarc'h description: \"red berries.\" That's fine, actually.\nIroaz has average staying power for an Eau de Toilette. I wish it lasted longer on my skin, but this lightness also means that Iroaz is nearly impossible to over-apply (making it suitable for daytime and office-wear) and that it's easy to wear for hot summer weather as well as balmy spring days.\nLostmarc'h Iroaz is available as 100 ml ($85) Eau de Toilette. For purchasing information, see the listing for Lostmarc'h under Perfume Houses.\nNote: top image courtesy of the author.\nI usually run the other way when I see marine or aquatic notes listed, but I came across a sample of this and liked it quite a lot. I should try it again now that it\u2019s getting warmer\u2014thanks for the reminder!\nJanice, I feel the same way about most marine and aquatic fragrances \u2014 but this one is an exception! It\u2019s not a \u201cclean\u201d marine fragrance, thanks to the rose and the sheer earthy notes.\n Really, if all the so-called \u201cmarine\u201d fragrances really smelled like the ocean, they wouldn\u2019t be so bad! but they\u2019re so fake and harsh, they really do remind me more of swimming pools. Hence all those bright blue juices\u2026?\nThanks for the review. I love the house of Lostmarch. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve never tried Iroaz. Lostmarch L\u2019eau de L\u2019Hermine was one of my first full bottle purchases and I also love Lann-Ael. I\u2019ve debated a bottle of Aod for a long time (but I\u2019m still enjoying my decant). The only one I\u2019m not entirely sold on is Ael-Mat \u2013 seems to have a bit of a sour note on my skin. I will add Iroaz to my \u201cto try\u201d list!\nHi Jessica. I love Iroaz and haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my mind since sampling a vial of it many months ago. It\u2019s hard to justify buying it outright \u2014 in addition to all my other scents, I already have decants of Coup de Foudre and Un Zeste d\u2019Une Rose (a favorite Rosine). But I think Iroaz would be really great for summer. I am often drawn to this kind of rose scent that\u2019s lifted by citrus and other \u201cairy\u201d notes. Thanks for the review and for bringing it to the attention of NST readers. I very much agree that it\u2019s worth sampling.\nWell, then, my work is finished here. For the time being, at least.\nThe first perfume I smelled on my first trip to Paris was Iroaz. So glad I purchased a bottle b/c every time I open it I think of that lovely spring time in the city of lights. Oops, this is starting to sound like a perfume ad.\nSullapelle, that\u2019s a wonderful memory, worth holding onto (and worth sharing!).\nLostmarc\u2019h is a house I\u2019ve been curious about for some time, so thanks for this lovely review, Jessica \u2013 it\u2019s given me the push I needed to get on with ordering their sample box!<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "\u2019t say that Memo Paris is my favorite brand but they have won me over with a couple of their fragrances. This year I was captivated by Winter Palace which as a perfume is an intersection between cold cologne notes of lemon orange and warm notes of red tea and soft amber. It\u2019s a kind of perfume that suits all 4 seasons. I am a happy owner of that pretty bottle.\nFrancesca Bianchi Etruscan Water \u2013 It\u2019s been a prolific year for Francesca as she has graced us with 5 fragrances. Out of these Etruscan Water was my clear favorite. This is a gorgeous citrus-fruity chypre done with recognizable style of Francesca. To me this perfume is also a nod to the classics of the past for there is something in this perfume that reminds me of vitange Eau Sauvage from Dior.\nMona di Orio Amyitis \u2013 In the past I\u2019ve heard a lot of good things about Amyitis but it was discontinued before I became a fan of this maison de parfum. Luckily for me it was reissued in 2019 in the same state as Mona composed it (according to the brand info). It has a beautiful iris note with a soft oriental entourage and mellow woody tones in the base. I highly recommend this one.\nDusita Splendiris \u2013 I think of Pissara Umavijani as a friend so when she let me smell her fantastic iris composition for which she didn\u2019t have a name I knew I wanted to help. Fragrantica organized a naming contest and my idea \u2013 Reve d\u2019Aurore was one of the finalists. I visited Pissara at her Parisian boutique just a day before the results announcement, when perfume was named Splendiris.\nAmouage Love Mimosa \u2013 I harly like anything from Amouage this days. For me this Omani brand was on a constant downfall for the past 3-4 years. Love Mimosa is a beautiful and realistic springtime in a bright yellow bottle. A charming evocation of pollen puffs on pom-pom like mimosa flowers. But my head still cannot justify the amount of money the brand is asking for it.\nJul et Mad Stairway to Heaven \u2013 It\u2019s been 2 years since the previous Jul et Mad perfume was launched. This year the brand comes back to the scene with a composition inspired by Juliens and Madalina\u2019s Himalayan adventure. Together with Cecile Zarokian they composed a fresh, metallic and musky scent, which similarly to Chanel 1957, is more enjoyable than one would expect.\nPuredistance Gold \u2013 This year we were treated to 2 new creations from this luxurious brand owned by Jan Vos. Aenotus was a beautiful ode to cologne that whispers on skin. But I think that Gold has outshined it with its complexity and intricate sensuality that could seduce you by telling you one of the stories of 1001 Nights. It\u2019s a richly glamorous perfume for special occasions.\nAtelier des Ors Pomelo Riviera \u2013 I\u2019m always in for a good citrus perfume but I find many of them to be bland, boring or simply too sweet to evoke the natural bitterness of lemons and grapefruits. Pomelo Riviera from Riviera Collection has a tartness and bittery flavor that I\u2019ve been looking for. It\u2019s a superb option for a summer fragrance that will transport you virtually to the heart of Cote d\u2019Azur.\nJacques Fath L\u2019Iris de Fath \u2013 Revived in fact in 2018 but I haven\u2019t tried it on skin until 2019. It is a unique feeling to smell the legendary perfume on your own skin. It\u2019s a wonderful fatty orris butter galore surrounded by jasmine and rose. Elegant and timeless. Due to its astronomic price I know that I\u2019ll never wear it again. I can only but hope for the brand to make more accessible version.\nOrmonde Jayne Osmanthus Elixir \u2013 During my summer vacation trip in Italy and in the Alps I experienced the smell of a real osmanthus plant and it is a cherished memory of mine. I have not had much contact with Ormonde Jayne (I know many love Ta\u2019If) but their Osmanthus Elixir introduced this year was very close to that smell. A lovely perfume with Asian influences.\nHiram Green Lustre \u2013 Rose was a scope of big interest in niche perfumery this year and among multiple rosy releases Lustre from Hiram Green was received particularly well. Hiram has worked some magic with his natural raw materials, creating a fragrance that is rich, intensive yet airy and spring-like at the same time. Its magnificent & silky bouquet surely would cheer up many of you.\nPerris Monte Carlo Arancia di Sicilia \u2013 I quite liked the first trio of citrus fragrances from Perris. This year they added a 4th one and it\u2019s completely different compared to prior releases. What I especially like about it is that it combines the Mediterranean bounty of orange with cinnamon and almond liqueur, which makes it something more than a cologne. It\u2019s a really interesting scent.\nFollowing what I already observed in 2018, niche perfumery this year was a lot about giving the world more crowd-pleasing fragrances with little backstory to them. Competition never sleeps and more and more brands are appearing out of nowhere \u2013 guess there\u2019s less and less space for creativity and innovation. I\u2019m not going to say if 2019 was a good or bad year for me. There were things I liked and things I didn\u2019t like.  Before 2020 comes here\u2019s my wish for us all \u2013 never stop dreaming, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s waiting for you behind the corner. Here is to a prosperous New Year, may it be kind for all of us & may it bring lots of good things. Yours truly, Lucas.\ntick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock goes the clock, counting down the days until Christmas. There are only 9 days of Advent before the festive time is here, so if you haven\u2019t yet met Santa to tell him what presents your family and relatives would like to find under the tree, this is almost your last chance to do it before it\u2019s too late. As for myself I already completed my Santa quest and together with my Dad we\u2019ve found a perfect spruce on Saturday. We plan to dress it in lights & ornaments next weekend probably. I don\u2019t feel the atmosphere of Christmas yet but it will come to me eventually. It has to.\nChristmas time is always filled with positive feelings, with good smiles and kindness. Everyone and everything seems to have that inner shine that we often don\u2019t have on a day-to-day basis. Things look a bit prettier and even strangers seem more friendly. For me this is also the time to unwind and relax. For Christmas Eve and Christmas Day you probably put on some special clothes to be dressed more festive & elegant. And since for us perfume is an essential element of our outfit, you probably already started deliberating what perfume to wear on that special occasion.\nHere are a few ideas of fragrances that I would wear to celebrate Christmas festivities.\nGuerlain Iris Ganache \u2013 For me iris is not only a favorite note but in my opinion it is also one of the most elegant smells in perfumery, which makes it suitable for many different celebrations. In case of Iris Ganache you have a richness of a white chocolate served in a mousse-light form. It it surrounded by a buttery texture of iris that goes more powdery later on. Topped with a bit of zest and sprinkled with cinnamon for a delicious feeling on your skin. This perfume melts with your body, leaving a transparent vanillic-ambery veil to enjoy on that special evening. It\u2019s a very smart gourmand.\nTauer Phi Une Rose de Kandahar \u2013 A list like this wouldn\u2019t feel complete if there wasn\u2019t at least one rose perfume among my suggestions. Fruity opening with a gorgeous apricot accord leads to the heart where roses, geranium and bitter almond meet. The result is an incredibly rich, yet not overpowering fragrant blend. Phi feels plush, velvety and uber luxurious and the smell of tobacco leaf makes this perfume stand out even more in the crowd. As hours pass tonka, vanilla and musk form a silky cocoon around your body. With Phi you\u2019ll be the best smelling one at midnight mass.\nAedes Cierge de Lune \u2013 Chrismas is the time that brings more light to our life, so why not decide on a perfume that can light up the night. Starting with a shimmering crystal accord that has a slightly mineral scent, after a couple of minutes this perfume starts to reveal a very unusual and intriguing vanilla like I\u2019ve never smelled before. It\u2019s oriental but airy, not sweet but delicious. Surrounded by black and pink pepper, ylang, ambroxan and musk, among others, this perfume is sure to make you feel glamorous and special when you\u2019re with your family, enjoying those days together.\nDiptyque Oud Palao \u2013 I think that during Christmas there\u2019s no need to hide behind a perfume or limit oneself. Why not go all out? Oud Palao definitely isn\u2019t a quiet fragrance. It\u2019s<|endoftext|>"

The top notes comprise of bergamot and insolent pink pepper. The middles notes feature jasmine and tuberose petals while the base notes offer patchouli, oud, vetiver, sandalwood and amber trail.\nVan Cleef And Arpels is a luxury French jewelry, watch and perfume company. It was founded by Charles Arpels and his brother-in-law Alfred Van Cleef in 1896. The pair opened their first shop in prestigious Place Vend\u00f4me in 1906. They gained notoriety for their use of precious stones and their expertise and innovation in stone-setting techniques.\nThe Van Cleef and Arpels empire expanded to multiple boutiques between 1909 and 1939. In 1942, the Arpels family emigrated to the United States and opened their first American boutique in New York. The company eventually expanded into Asia, and remained under the operation and management of family members until 1999, when it was acquired by Compagnie Financi\u00e8re Richemont S.A., Beautiful Van Cleef & Arpels jewelry has adorned the bodies of royalty, prominent political figures, socialites and numerous actresses and entertainers.The company's first foray into fragrances came with First for Women, in 1978, a classic floral aldehyde scent. First has remained a popular choice and inspired a number of flankers over the years. Other notable releases include men's classic Tsar (1989), Feerie (2008) and the Collection Extraordinaire, a luxury line whose first fragrance was introduced in 2009.\nVan Cleef and Arpels Has 60 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1976 and the newest is from 2019. Van Cleef & Arpels fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Richard Herpin, Jean-Claude Ellena, Roger Pellegrino, Sonia Constant, Domitille Bertier, Olivier Polge, Pascal Giraux, Louis Monnet, Jacques Cavallier, Alberto Morillas, Quentin Bisch, Fabrice Pellegrin, Emilie (Bevierre) Coppermann, Antoine Maisondieu, Mark Buxton, Nathalie Feisthauer, Nathalie Gracia-Cetto, Randa Hammami, Amandine Clerc-Marie, Julien Rasquinet, Olivier Pescheux, Evelyne Boulanger, Christophe Raynaud, Antoine Lie, Nathalie Lorson, Francis Kurkdjian, Thierry Wasser, Bernard Ellena and Philippe Bousseton.\nBut above all, they were inspired by the desire to create something lasting together. That desire led them to found the Maison of Van Cleef and Arpels. In 1906, Alfred set up in business with Estelle\u2019s brother Charles, a talented salesman who managed their new boutique in Paris\u2019 Place Vend\u00f4me. Two years later, Estelle\u2019s brother Julien joined the firm; they were joined in 1912 by her third brother, Louis. Over the years that followed, they succeeded in making Van Cleef And Arpels synonymous with the most exquisite jewelry in the world. With that achievement, the love which first brought Estelle and Alfred together lives on to this day through the many enchanting love stories of the Maison.\n34 Boulevard Saint Germain DIPTYQUE Eau De Toilette 100ml For HIM Diptyque is a French p..\nL'absolu Gloss Sheer 317 LANCOME 8ml Lanc\u00f4me L'absolu Gloss Sheer - 317 Porq..\nDahlia Noir Eau GIVENCH<|endoftext|>"

Much has been written about her father's membership in the Nazi Party during World War II, she is the author of several novels and non-fiction works at least one of which was tainted by accusations of plagiarism, and on several occasions, has been accused of outright racism.\nPrincess Pushy, as she has been called, certainly stands out. And so she should, as at six feet tall, she towers over most of the women of the House of Windsor!\nGuess what? It's going to....rain! All next week. Washington's January tradition continues.\nStill reading The Alice Network by Kate Quinn. I somehow ordered the large-print version from the library, great on the eyes but oh my, it's heavy to cart back and forth every day.\nFinally watched the movie I added to our Amazon Library for us to enjoy at Christmas, Midway, with Woody Harrelson and Dennis Quaid. It was excellent and I was amazed at the similarity between the actors and the real-life heroes they portrayed, superb casting. The movie was filmed in part in Hawaii and I caught a glimpse of my friend's husband, in major command in Hawaii at the time, who was an extra. As it was not a speaking role, he was not listed in the credits but I did see his name in the Special Thanks To section. The credits go on and on, with many sections dedicated to the visual effects teams.\nBack to work last week - steady all week so the days flew by. I woke up on Thursday to an eerie silence in the house (the heater is on a timer so it comes on just before I wake up), looked at my phone and found a dead battery. Walked into the kitchen to check the time - 7:16am! Good grief, overslept and missed the bus so I texted the office to say I'd be late, dove in the shower, and drove in. Thankfully, I found a convenient parking place. Since I had the car, I ran to Costco after work for groceries, then to World Market for tea, and stopped at Chipotle for one of the Whole 30 bowls for dinner. Today will be Day 15 on the Whole 30, it's going well. I've also managed to drink water (not the full 8 8-ounce glasses, more like half that amount, but it's a start) every day. Win! Picked up my dry cleaning and dropped off more. Went to Whole Foods on Saturday for a few things I couldn't get at Costco and spent the rest of the weekend on chores and relaxing. Busy, busy, busy.\nNo progress. Have ear-marked January 17 as December Daily Day. Since it's a three-day weekend, I figured I could dedicate one day to crafts.\nGinger cut her leg so Sophia has spent the last four days keeping the wound clean and wrapped. Not severe enough to warrant a vet visit but worrying all the same. She and the barn owner went over the stall carefully to see what might have caused it but found nothing. It did give her a chance to get her equine first aid kit fully stocked.\nI'm the January hostess for Rudolph Day over at the Magical Holiday Home forums. Rudolph Day is the 25th of each month, a day to take a few moments to plan some simple tasks for the month ahead, in order to get ready for Christmas Day with plenty of time to spare. By starting early--and working a bit at a time on each month's Rudolph Day--it's easy to prepare for Christmas, save money on gifts, and cut holiday stress.\nLast year we took it in turns to suggest a movie, book, magazine, blog, YouTube craft or cooking video, and a Pinterest idea, sharing the details before the 10th of each month so the members can come back on the 25th and tell us how they enjoyed the selections and any other thoughts. If you're not a member of Magical Holiday Home, I'll put the details up on Friday if you'd like to check it out.\nI know many of you are thinking...\"What, Christmas already? I've just put away my decorations!\" Well, for Christmas-lovers like us, we're always counting down the days (348, in case you were wondering! \ud83d\ude09) and planning to be as organized as possible to enjoy the holiday season when it arrives.\nI've decided to hop on the 2021 Home Organization Challenge, suggested by Tanya from The Other Side of the Road. Week 1 is the Laundry Room so stay tuned for what I did.\nAnd finally, does anyone use Stevia? I'd love to hear your comments.\nHappy 39th Birthday today to Her Royal Highness, The Duchess of Cambridge. Since there was no gathering of the Royal Family for Christmas, there was no walk back from church on Christmas Day with all the beautiful coats and hats on display so I've picked another occasion to share with you. I love that all of these coats were from her existing wardrobe, a nice touch in these austere times. How I would love to take a peek at the Duchess' coat closet!\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge undertook a Nationwide tour of three days on the request of the British Government in December 2020. The 1250 miles long tour saw the Royal couple thanking the UK frontline workers, organizations and communities for their generosity during the pandemic that kept the country going.\nHere are a few things from under my Christmas tree - I'm looking forward to trying them all.\nLuxury perfumer diptyque began in 1961 at 34 Boulevard Saint-Germain, Paris, where three artistic friends opened a storefront bazaar.

The fragrance uncovers unexpected aspects of the rose such as accents of artichoke, litchi, and chamomile, creating a fruity, gentle scent that lies within the floral fragrance family.\nThese bespoke accents have caused the Eau de Rose parfum to be aptly described as an olfactory accident. These unique accents are due to the distillation water of the damascene rose being subjected to a second extraction. Meaning perfumer Fabrice Pellegrin was able to create a more intense, complex, and innovative fragrance.\nThe Eau Rose eau de toilette uses the Damascus and centifolia roses to create a beautiful luxurious fragrance that allows the flowers to linger in their most natural form on the skin. The scent is blended with fresh green rose to add lightness, elegance, and flair to the scent.<|endoftext|>"

I\u2019m not finding it super heavy, but I did just dab from a sample.\nYes, I remember you commented about the book \u2013 ha, and it WAS months ago. Thus proving how slooooowly I am reading it.\nIt\u2019s a slow reader, for sure. Lots of bits and angles to absorb.\nI\u2019ll def retry now based on your feedback, springpansy!\nIt\u2019s wonderful, and layers well.\nYes, been meaning to hunt out Shelley\u2019s work! Adding to and promoting to the top of my list!\nIf you haven\u2019t tried it: Amouage Lilac Love is not what the packaging and name suggest. Not really chocolate, but a wonderful (well, I like it!) frisson inducing combination of dry florals and cocoa.\nIf you come across it, Missoni Gianduia is worth sampling, ambery chocolate, a lot of the old Missoni are good like Molto Missoni for a cinnamon scent and the bottle looks wonderful and I\u2019m not even much into bottles.\nOn. My. List!\nI worked at the city library too when I was a teenager. Loved that job. I worked in the cataloging department but would occasionally get asked for help from patrons while filing in the card catalog. Those were the good old days.\nWell, it\u2019s chilly and smoky in Los Angeles today, so truly this weird confluence of shivering and concern as, in one turn I\u2019m fishing for the \u201cwinter\u201d clothes (i.e. sleeved; more-than-cotton [it was 59ish this morning here, yes, deride our atmospherically challenged ways THE SUN HAS NOT HIT MY APARTMENT YET]) and another reaching out to everyone who\u2019s affected by the fires, and yeah\u2026 what a world.\nAnyhow, I had the pleasure of being at the 2nd Biennial Scent Fair this past weekend and I was able to finally sample the full line of Jolie Laide perfumes. They are all-natural and perfumer Heather Kaufman studied with Mandy Aftel, so there is a clear influence (and challenge therein) of that. Kaufman names her scents after French New Wave cinema (gettin\u2019 lit-eratured up, anyone?) and they are all a bit sleezy/skanky, and I like that, especially on this chilly day.\nSo, I\u2019m wearing a touch of Masculin F\u00e9minin which is this seductive green tobacco-inflected, slightly weedy chypre-esque sheath that wears beautifully on my skin. Not as skanky as some of her other work, but it\u2019s the morning so trying to attenuate my flaunt. I get some facets of geranium, davana, beeswax, tuberose (and I hate tuberose but this is suave here) or carnation\u2026 it\u2019s really well-done. Usual all-natural beefs, diffusion and tenacity, but honestly when you\u2019re watching your home turf burn down in an instant, time and expanse really come into question.\nIn all honesty I\u2019m gonna curl up later with Human, All Too Human by Nietzsche later, because these two together will help restore my optimism for joie de vivre and humanity. Also, Friedrich would *totally* rock this scent.\nWait \u2014 Nietzsche will restore your optimism?\nHe\u2019s *quite* misread and an ethicist/humanist at heart. Reading his work in German can bring you to tears \u2014 of joy AND futility.\nI had no idea and, unfortunately, speak no German. Very interesting, thanks.\nYes and yes! The arguments I\u2019ve had about this over the years...\nRight!? Like when Sarah Palin brought him up on the stump.\nYeah, I got a good four hours effusive and about eight hours intimate skin-close, but it was really lovely. A good break from the norm.\nThose wildfires are concerning. Be safe!\nIt\u2019s been really frightening here! The air was unbreathable yesterday and air quality authorities are recommending masks today, too. Uggghhhh.\nWe turned the heat on in the house for the first time here in San Diego this morning, it was chilly.\nI have triple asterisks next to this passage on a double-dogeared page.\nGood on ya! Me? Mustering all the flaunt I can, but happy at the thought of you trying to attenuate yours.\nThanks for the smile this evening!\nSOTM is Dior Homme \u2013 so yummy.

I beat him at both crossword puzzles this morning, so am feeling smug.\nI\u2019ve been reading odd books lately \u2013 finished The Bone Clocks recently, which completely weirded me out but simultaneously made me think about the many ways the human trajectory could go from here. Am now about a third of the way into Mr. Penumbra\u2019s 24-Hour Bookstore, which is wryly light-hearted yet somehow provokes deep thoughts about the places where ancient methods and traditions intersect with modern technology.\nI loved the Bone Clocks! Have you read Cloud Atlas?\nNo, I haven\u2019t \u2013 do you recommend it?\nI really loved Mitchell\u2019s The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet but cannot seem to make headway in Cloud Atlas. Need to try again.\nCloud Atlas changes DRASTICALLY after the first chapter, and is one of my top favorite books. If you can get through that first chapter I hope you will love the rest.\nThe Thousand Autumns might be my favorite of his books, but I also love Cloud Atlas.\nOh, good to know! Between your recommendation and Robin\u2019s, I will definitely check out the Thousand Autumns. Will probably give Cloud Atlas a try as well, but after a bit of a break. The Bone Clocks jumped around among the various characters and their stories enough to be quite disorienting, and I think I need continuity in my next few reads.\nRereading The Winter of Our Discontent. John Steinbeck.\nCostume National Scent redux.\n<3 <3 here for all of this.\nAny chance you\u2019ve purchased Angelique Kidjo\u2019s covers of Remain in Light and can speak on it?

Must revisit sometime this winter.\nAlways reminds me of the Red Green Show\u2026The Winter of Our Discount Tent????????\nWacky Canadians, lol!\nOMG That is hilarious! I used to love the Red Green show.\nSampling Tardes and Costarela today.\nThe former is spicy honey and the latter is orange popsicle in the best possible way.????\nHmmm, orange popsicle is always tempting.\nMmm, orange creamsicle.

Same with the Harry Potter books, they make for a lovely cozy winter break read.\nScent of the day is Atelier Cologne Camelia Intrepide, which, as it turns out, projects much better in cooler weather. The drydown that used to be a skin scent envelopes me like a warm, comfy cloud now. One of the happier discoveries of the week.\nI\u2019m also trying to make up my mind about Eau des Merveilles Bleue.

        "passage": " the day!\nDiptyque Volutes is a sweet, powdered tobacco cologne that elegantly combines the fresh, powdery floral note of iris with the sweet, rich smell of tobacco. Fabrice Pellegrin created this scent, which was first released in 2012.\nTobacco, Iris, Honey, Spices, and Styrax are among the fragrance notes.\nWhat Are the Scents of Diptyque Volutes?\nVolutes begins with a burst of rich, powdered iris, evoking that powdery impression right away. Along with the iris, there\u2019s a sweet honey aroma that adds density but also a lovely and rich sweetness. The honey and iris will last for a while before the tobacco emerges.\nThe tobacco is rich and profoundly sweet, precisely like the tobacco aroma we all know and love. And when you combine the honey and iris notes, you get something very wonderful. The honey brings out the tobacco flavor, while the iris lends a powdery, refreshing note.\nThe scent then becomes somewhat richer and warmer as it dries down. The tobacco is prominent, and the honey is still present, contributing to a pleasant and thick aroma. The note of styrax, which has a velvety, almost leathery fragrance, is another inclusion. All of this provides a proper conclusion to a genuinely exceptional fragrance.\nThis fragrance is best used in the autumn and winter since it focuses on warm and pleasant tones. This perfume is soothing and welcoming, and it works well in both professional and informal situations. It\u2019s both opulent and laid-back, making it a flexible and pleasurable smell.\nChergui is a perfume by Serge Lutens, a label recognized for making colognes with rich and powerful elements. Tobacco is one of those notes, and it was utilised brilliantly in the creation of this masterpiece. This scent was created by Christopher Sheldrake and launched in 2005.\nTobacco Leaves, Honey, Amber, Hay, Incense, Sandalwood, Iris, Musk, and Rose are among the fragrance notes.\nWhat is the scent of Serge Lutens Chergui?\nChergui starts off robust and sweet, with tobacco and honey flavors in the front. Both of these sounds are quite sweet and strong, and when combined, they produce something very amazing. The honey is rich and sticky, and the tobacco smells like a delicious pipe tobacco. A balancing aspect of iris and rose, two fresh floral notes, is added to these two forceful tones. However, the iris is a tad powdered, giving the perfume a thicker texture.\nYou\u2019ll notice a few woody notes, as well as a mild and smokey incense influence, as you go. The incense and woody tones are subtle and unnoticeable, yet they provide depth to the mix. The major stars of this perfume are still tobacco and honey.\nThe honey begins to mellow down throughout the dry down, becoming softer and more laid-back. The tobacco remains robust, emitting a pleasant, almost cherry-like aroma. All of this is counterbalanced with a strange hay tone. The hay note is there from the start, ensuring that this cologne is softened and not too overbearing. The hay itself has a dry, easygoing aroma that is an excellent complement to this overpowering perfume.\nChergui is wealthy, powerful, and powerful. In fact, it\u2019s much too powerful for hot summer days and is better suited to the cooler autumn and winter months. You\u2019ll find a soothing and pleasant aroma here that fits in every setting. It\u2019s elegant and opulent enough for the workplace or a big conference, yet casual enough for a day or night out with friends.\nBurberry London For Men is a fantastic tobacco-based fragrance that, owing to its affordable price, is ideal for younger generations. Burberry London For Men, created by Antoine Maisondieu and released in 2006, is a great tobacco fragrance with a deep and sweet perfume.\nCinnamon, lavender, and bergamot are the top notes.\nLeather and mimosa are the middle notes.\nTobacco Leaves, Opoponax, Guaiac Wood, and Oakmoss are the base notes.\nWhat Is The Smell Of Burberry London For Men?\nBurberry London For Men starts with sweet and spicy cinnamon notes, complemented by bergamot and lavender notes. The lavender is light and fragrant, with a hint of spice, which pairs well with the cinnamon and the impending tobacco.\nWith the passage of time, the tobacco note emerges. The tobacco is rich, warming, and somewhat sweet, and it pairs well with the cinnamon from the start. A silky leather aroma accompanies the tobacco, providing both a pleasant sensation and an overwhelming depth of richness. They make up the majority of the cologne\u2019s middle, together with the tobacco.\nAs the aroma dries down, a resinous undertone emerges, which is both sweet and silky. This ties in beautifully with the aroma that has already been developed. From here, the cologne doesn\u2019t really alter much, leaving you with a fantastic perfume that takes the tobacco note and turns it into something more young and fun.\nBurberry London For Men is a rich, sweet scent that is ideal for the autumn and winter seasons. This perfume is best worn informally during the cooler months, since it may be a touch too lively for a more serious atmosphere. However, it\u2019s fantastic whether worn casually during the day or at night. It\u2019s all the better for a more casual situation because of the fun!\nOne million dollars Prive is a flanker to Paco Rabanne\u2019s immensely successful One Million fragrance. Prive was created by combining the original DNA with a sweet tobacco undertone. This perfume was created by Christophe Raynaud and launched in 2016.\nCinnamon and Blood Mandarin are the top notes.\nTonka Bean and Patchouli are the base notes.\nOne Million Prive starts with a burst of tobacco and cinnamon, resulting in an incredibly rich and sweet aroma with the One Million DNA intact. One Million is recognized for its pleasant, young aroma, which is present in this composition as well. The inclusion of tobacco, which adds another layer of sweetness to the combination, is the primary distinction.\nThe smell doesn\u2019t alter much from here on out. Several pleasant notes, like as myrrh and tonka bean, are introduced, yet none of them overpower the tobacco. A juicy tangerine is added to the blend, which lends a refreshing sweetness to the mix and balances off the thick sweet notes, although this cologne is mostly sweet and powerful.\nHowever, as the dry down progresses, things begin to calm down. The strong sweetness begins to fade, while the perfume itself begins to mellow out and become creamier. Of course, the tobacco and cinnamon are still there, but everything appears to be a bit more muted.\nOverall, this is a fantastic fragrance with a pleasant and young aroma. This would be an excellent trademark perfume for a younger man, since you can wear it almost all of the time. It\u2019s appropriate for school or work, as well as evenings out, dates, or lazy days at home. There\u2019s no way to go wrong with this one, as long as you use the right amount of sprays for your destination.\nThe \u201cwoody tobacco cologne\u201d is a popular fragrance for men. This article will list the 16 best tobacco fragrances for men.<|endoftext|>"

Walking on wet grass and breathing in its zingy freshness and the warming fragrance of dense woods all of which can have such a positive impact on our emotional health and well-being.\nThe very essence of natural ingredients can work to wonders towards eliminating depression or anxiety and have strong healing properties for some health conditions as well. For thousands of years people have been aware of the powers of nature, flowers were known to spread happiness through their beauty, their scent, and have had a huge importance in ceremonial and religious services.\nInitially, they offered home furnishings and manufactured printed fabrics even imported scents from England. Later on, they added scented candles which turned into a huge success. Then, they added fragrances followed by body and face care. All tied together within their striking visual identity and beautiful scent collections.\nAs a truly trailblazing company, they have always worked towards dynamic innovations for both body and home fragrance. The newest piece of wonderful design is a diptyque travel-friendly perfume holder.\nDo Son (Floral)The sea breeze carried with it the intoxicating and spicy scent of tuberose, orange blossom alongside jasmine.\nPhilosykos (woody) is an ode to the entire fig tree: the green freshness of the leaves, the milky flavour of the figs, the density of the white wood.\nEau Rose (Floral) Pick up the petals of a rose, add its green leaves, its stem, and don\u2019t forget its buds. Immerse in clear water and wait to reveal its rosy delicateness, fruity accents and acidulated green notes\u2026 Eau Rose is composed like an infusion of the finest Damascene and Centifolia roses.\nEau des Sens(Floral) brings together all the dimensions of the bitter orange tree, its branches, leaves and fruit. \nAs for the design of the bottle, it was also linked to travel as the team got a spark of inspiration from vintage notice boards, the type used at airports and train stations.\nThe hand-sized perfume flask is a unique customisation puzzle in order for customers to personalise their own bottles. It comes in a complete mini kit that contains the travel spray, a selection of letters with a travel pouch. There is also a smart feature as the bottle is refillable ensuring less waste and easy reuse for customers.\nFurthermore, diptyque expanded its hand care range. Already present is the Softening hand wash which has a mild, soothing, and sweet almond essence to it scent. It contains pure lavender water, honey and rosemary floral water. All the elements included have great properties, for example, the lavender water comforts purifies and repairs whilst the rosemary water leaves your hands healthy balanced and the honey helps to moisturise the skin.\nThere is also the Velvet Hand lotion. This lotion is very lightweight and feels like air but still, the lotion nourishes and protects our hands and comforts them. It includes lots of healing and caring natural products for example the immortelle floral water which is recognised for its regenerating and anti-free radical properties, that repairs and protects the hands. Or the roman chamomile floral water which soothes and softens the skin. The added sesame oil, an antioxidant-rich in fatty acids, moisturizes and restructures the skin, making it extra supple.\nThis Exfoliating hand wash is refreshing and exotic as it contains a unique combination of fragrances. An aromatic garden with green, floral, and woody fragrances it is foaming and cleansing. As diptyque wants to provide complete sustainable products they scrub is created using olive stones as an exfoliating agent instead of the plastic beads. The olive stones have the added benefit of leaving a soft, purified and cleansed feel on your hand.\nWhether it is perfumes, candles or hand care range diptyque believes in creating magic by keeping in tune with nature as a central part of its DNA. Remaining connected to their roots, they keep their products free from harmful chemicals such as phthalates, parabens, TED/DEA, silicones, aluminium, mineral oils, synthetic colours and sulphates. In keeping with a brand that owes much to nature they have backed this up by making the perfume bottle refillable and the hand care glass decorative bottle are reusable.

Grasse is the perfume centre of the world, and legendary Grasse company Fragonard\u2019s flowery Orange Blossom, herby Coriandre Lemongrass or zingy Gingembre reed diffusers make three outstanding choices (and are conveniently stocked at Marks & Spencer). Loewe\u2019s Tomato Leaves, Jo Malone London\u2019s almond-scented Pastel Macaroons and Tom Dixon\u2019s earthy, woodsy Underground diffuser are more offbeat fragrance trails to pursue.\nChoose candles for instant atmosphere, but only, of course, if you are able to keep a watchful eye while they\u2019re burning. After lighting the candle, don\u2019t extinguish it until the top layer of wax has melted or eventually the wick will sink lower, wax will rise around it and you will lose many hours of burn time. Diptyque\u2019s candles are perennial dinner party favourites, especially the classic fig tree fragrance Figuier and sublime Tubereuse. More unusual choices could be Lumos Apothecary\u2019s Cuban Tobacco & Oak, Jo Loves\u2019 Smoked Plum & Leather and Balmoral, offering the scent of \u2018mist, soil and meadows\u2019, from Cire Trudon, the revered centuries-old French candlemakers that supplied the court of Louis XIV.\nReed diffusers provide a constant and subtler scent, but these are more recently rivalled by electronic diffusers that hold aromatic oil and release puffs of fragrance mist into the air at pre-set intervals, rather like the overhead wires above the streets of Grasse. Their sleek, scuptural shapes make them a tabletop asset, too, as in The White Company\u2019s tall white ceramic diffuser, Aromatherapy Associates navy ceramic bowl and This Works Scent Well Portable Diffuser, which is handily powered by USB.\nThere are other ways, though, to introduce touches of fragrance into your home. Jo Malone CBE spritzes her bedlinen with cologne while the white floorboards in her Chelsea home are washed with Pomelo, a fresh grapefruit-infused citrus creation from Jo Loves. The tired image of potpourri has been invigorated with fresh components such as seashells and coconut husks in the Seychelles collection from the White Co, while Agraria\u2019s Bitter Orange potpourri is a chunky mix of cloves, bitter oranges and cypress. This celebrated spicy scent also translates into incense-style Burning Sticks as well as the elegant TasselAire, a long, orange silk tassel to hang on a doorknob or armoire key. If money is no object, however, L\u2019Artisan Parfumeur provides the ultimate home fragrance accessory to display prominently on tabletop or console: a hand-carved amber ball; yours for a mere \u00a31500.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "I have been enjoying a good perfume month so far, as I have been smelling new launches. L'Eau de Chloe, A Lab on Fire What We Do in Paris is Secret, Viktor & Rolf Spicebomb, Serge Lutens L'Eau Froide and Etat Libre d'Orange Fils de Dieu are the new fragrances I liked. I was not thrilled with Estee Lauder Bronze Goddess Capri, but I did not have particularly high expectations for it.\nWell despite overly mixed reviews and having no expectations, being stuck in an Airport afforded me time to \"poke my nose\" into Kokorico JPG - and blow me over! It was rather enjoyable.\nI also had time to check out the entire Jo Malone range, gorgeous scents, but only for the 1st 20 mins then they fade and become much of a muchness, but Oud & Bergamot is rather delicious and a little longer lasting that many of the others.\nHa! I bought Dior's Eau Fraiche as a gift for someone \u2013 and kept it for myself! Much nicer even than Eau de Guerlain (though I love G's bee bottle).\nI also liked Kokorico, and it was one of my mainstream favorites last year. Not a fan of head shaped bottles, but hey, at least it is distinctive.\nI love Eau Fraiche! Have you had a chance to smell revamped Diorling?\nA few days ago I tried Infanta en Flor (artquisite) and liked it. I wanted to smell it again and again. The flowers combined with the leather are addictive. The new Cavalli fragrance is very beautiful too.\nGood part of the month: Loved the Thierry Mugler Womanity Taste of Fragrance (It's stronger, with a lot more fig then the original and a note that smelled like peanut butter to me,it's spicy but not very spicy and it's less salty) and I could not help myself so I bought it.\nCalvin Klein Sheer Beauty a fruity floral that sadly smells exactly like shampoo and it does not resemble the original Beauty not one bit.\nIt would be great to read your review on the new new L'Eau de Chloe.\nI tried Bronze Goddess Capri.\nOh well, the search for the Magical Tropical Summer Fragrance continues.....\nA new love is the already old Rossy de Palma Eau de Protection,adore it,can't get enough!\nVery disappointed with the latest Etat Libre scent Bijou Romantique,had high hopes because it is by Matilde Bijaoui,but it has a harsh powdery aspect to it that makes it a scrubber for me.Haven't seen any reviews of it yet,have you tried it?\n\"Have you had a chance to smell revamped Diorling?\"\nNo, but as you mention it, I'll seek it out \u2013 just as long as those harpies and their little paper touches keep out of my way!\nYour review of Diptyque's Eau Rose inspired me to try more perfumes with a prominent rose note and now I can't get enough! This was a great surprise as I have basically ruled out even trying several perfumes because I didn't think I could ever wear rose. This is great for the new perfumes that will enter my life, not so good for the wallet.\n Up front I got this huge hit of stale cigarette ash. Very unexpected- I wonder if anyone else has experienced this? I tried it again a couple days later, and there it was again -- this perfumre literally made my stomach lurch. Sorry if I'm speaking ill of someone's favorite fragrance -- none of the reviews I've read say anything about a tobacco note, nevermind stale cigarettes so maybe it's just me.\nI liked several from Arquiste, especially Anima Dulcis. Although now that it is warming up, I am craving something fresher and brighter.\nI also wanted to love Guerlain Aqua Allegoria Orange Magnifica, but it was strangely flat. So far, Atelier Cologne Orange Sanguine is my favorite orange scent. It is really like biting into a big, juicy orange!\nIt is ready, in line to be posted!\nHaven't smelled Bijou Romantique yet. I love the name. Harsh and powdery certainly doesn't sound good.\nI'm so glad to hear that you are enjoying rose perfumes. They are certainly very diverse, and it is fun to sample and compare.\nMy first reaction on smelling Les Nez Manoumalia was very visceral. It smelled like something rotten, stale.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": ": to catch my attention with a new one, it has to be more surprising than Vetyverio. There are, admittedly, a few vetivers that I find perhaps too masculine to wear comfortably \u2014 Ma\u00eetre Parfumeur et Gantier Route du Vetiver comes to mind \u2014 but not many, and for that matter, there are lots of wonderful light, sharable vetivers out there already. But if you haven't found your perfect vetiver, Vetyverio is absolutely worth trying.\nDiptyque Vetyverio was developed by perfumer Olivier Pescheux. It is available in 50 and 100 ml Eau de Toilette; for buying information, see the listing for Diptyque under Perfume Houses.\nMy favorite vetiver so far (and by far) is Sycomore: I love it\u2019s smoky facet.\nI also enjoy vetiver tonka from time to time, though admittedly I don\u2019t wear it much!\nExcellent review, Robin. You\u2019ve probably answered this question a hundred times, and if you have I apologize, but what are your favorite vetivers?\nGuerlain Vetiver, FM Vetiver Extraordinaire, LesNez Turtle Vetiver #1, Hermes Vetiver Tonka, Lalique Encre Noire.\nFor lighter vetiver, Chanel Sycomore really is wonderful. Also like Kenzo Air, OJ Zizan.\nVettiveru! My fave light one.\nOh thank you \u2014 that\u2019s another nice one!\nThanks, Robin! I\u2019ve got a wonderful botlte of vintage Guerlain Vetiver, and I definitely need to try the Hermes. Unfortunately, Sycomore turns \u201cdirty ashtray\u201d on me. They actually list a note called \u2018burning woods\u2019 \u2013 I\u2019ll say!\nI love that part, but I know not everyone does.\nLaughing a bit that you consider Sycomore \u201clighter.\u201d I think it might be my favorite, and I don\u2019t get the wood smoke that people talk about so often. Someone complimented me on it in a movie theater once when I had layered with Terre d\u2019Hermes. I wore it last week and LOVE how thoroughly it permeates my t-shirt, which I then wear to bed for a couple nights in a row.\nWell, it\u2019s lighter than Vetiver Extraordinaire or the Turtle Vetiver, right? I guess it\u2019s probably about the same as the Guerlain, and the Hermes is somewhere in between? Or do you think that\u2019s crazy?\nNo, not crazy. I just consider Sycomore a very \u201cvetiver blast\u201d fragrance. Ask March what she thinks about its thermonuclear properties. It\u2019s deceptively easy to over-apply, I think.\nThanks for the review, Robin! Good to the see the list of notes because I was picking up the spices but wasn\u2019t sure what they were.\nDiptyque kindly sent me a couple of samples last week and my impressions were pretty much the same \u2013 nice but not a must have. Not enough vetiver for my liking and what\u2019s there is very clean and lacking that lovely\u2026 raspy quality that some vetiver fragrances have. Sycomore and Vetiver Tonka are still my favourites.\nI really like Diptyque \u2014 but sort of wish they\u2019d move away from the lighter fragrances they\u2019ve been doing the last 5 years or so. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re bad at all, just that it\u2019s been a long time since they\u2019d done anything that made much of a statement.\nI know what you mean. You\u2019d think that after those 3 (or is it 4 now?) colognes/eaux they brought out they\u2019d be in the mood for something different.\nRe: Diptyque\u2019s direction. I\u2019m going to toot the horn of L\u2019Eau de Tarocco again, which I think is worth repeated testing for those who passed it by. When sprayed (do try it sprayed), it\u2019s actually tenacious and delicious and doesn\u2019t wimp out on me \u2014 the orange and saffron and slight but discernible rosewater note remind me of delectable Persian desserts. I wore the hell out of it last summer and may do again.\nOh, again, don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 I think they\u2019ve mostly (exception being Lierre) been really nice scents. Just a lot of light things in a row, and wish they\u2019d do a deeper fragrance for a change, something that made a big statement.\nThe Diptyque boutique in SF had a tester of Eau Duelle, which is coming out in September. A very sweet vanilla, but since I only smelled in on a strip, I have no idea how strong it is. It\u2019s a strange scent for them, as if a vegetarian friend made you a hamburger.\nOh, good to hear it \u2014 thanks!\nI got to try it on my UK trip and enjoyed it a lot. It sat comfortably on me in it\u2019s mutedness :).\nIt sits comfortably on me too\u2026don\u2019t get me wrong, I really enjoyed wearing it. And would guess it will do well.\nI definitely fall under the \u201chaven\u2019t found my perfect vetiver fragrance\u201d category. In fact, I have struggled to appreciate vetiver as a note to this point. I LOVE most of Andy Tauer\u2019s frags, but Vetiver Dance doesn\u2019t do much for me. Probably everyone on NST knows I\u2019m rabid about Shaal Nur (since I mention it in practically every post!) but unlike Turin & Snachez in The Guide, it does not strike me as a vetiver scent. Robin, do you think that Vetyverio would be a good \u201cgateway\u201d vetiver frag, or is the vetiver too hidden amongst the supporting notes? Anyone else here have some recs for a gateway vetiver scent that might convert me to a veti-lover? Or am I doomed to think \u201cmeh\u201d every time I smell a vetiver?\nI wonder if you\u2019d like Jo Malone vetiver? It really grew on me and caused me to have more of an interest in vetiver. Although I think of it as more of a nutmeg scent than a vetiver scent!\nJM also do that Black Vetyver Cafe (vetiver and coffee) which is lovely.\nJill, I love the JM Vetiver and sometimes layer it with other perfumes as it makes a light rooty base, altho\u2019 I think if you overdo the spraying it can smell a bit like wee!. It\u2019s this particular vetiver that Jayne Ormonde\u2019s Tiare reminds me of \u2013 I\u2019d be interested to know if anyone else gets that.\nYou\u2019re so right about the overspraying, LOL! It needs to be sprayed pretty lightly. I love your idea of using it as a base, I haven\u2019t tried that yet. I haven\u2019t tried the Tiare \u2014 interesting comparison though!\nWell, it might well be a gateway vetiver! And have you tried Sycomore or Kenzo Air? Oh, or the Vetiver in the Armani Prive line?\nSycomore again! Have to try that one. SOTD is Guerlain\u2019s Vetiver pour Elle, which makes me fear I might have missed the vetiver bus and should have gone for regular old Vetiver on the split! I like TDC Sel de Vetiver too.\nAnd, as usual, nice review, Robin!\nWill add Comme des Garcons Vettiveru, which Tama mentions above.\nI didn\u2019t get all that much vetiver out of Shaal Nur either\u2026 although I admit that my attention may have been seized by the patchouli bludgeoning me about the head and face.\nLOL! I don\u2019t think of it as a \u201cvetiver fragrance\u201d either.\nI get a definite, beautiful vetiver in Shaal Nur, and the patchouli isn\u2019t strong for me. I wouldn\u2019t call it an incense fragrance or a vetiver fragrance, though, because of all the other wonderfulness going on.\nI think of it as an incense. Doesn\u2019t matter though, it\u2019s great stuff!\nIf you like rose I suggest trying \u00c9cume de Rose by Parfums de Rosine. It has a lovely vetiver drydown.\nArmani Priv\u00e9 Vetiver Babylone is other favourite of mine.\nK-Scott, I also love Shaal Nur and would not have identified it as a vetiver fragrance, either.\nThe vetiver that I wear the most is Annick Goutal. It has a sort of reflective mood that I appreciate, and it might make a good \u201cgateway\u201d vetiver. it\u2019s worth sampling if you get a chance.\nI\u2019m loving this mini-conversation here\u2014I haven\u2019t made friends with vetiver yet\u2026don\u2019t know if I ever will really. I do like Sycomore and maybe this Diptyque will lead me to vetiver like Philosykos opened my nostrils to fig\u2026.I\u2019m really looking forward to testing Vetyverio\u2026.which is funny because based on the name I sort of ignored this post today. I didn\u2019t have much extra time, figured so what if I missed a post about a vetiver<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " opens with a muguet note so sharp and authentically-rendered that it floors me, flooding my synapses with flashes of green and white. I wonder if the muguet is real, because it has none of the toilet freshener qualities of the reconstructed muguet note in modern Diorissimo. Speaking of the Big D \u2013 yes, there is a likeness, but only briefly and only at the top.\nThe synesthesiastic muguet opening is soon subsumed by a buttery, yellow tropical floral bouquet, led by a saber-toothed note that my nose identifies as tuberose, but I am reliably informed is ylang. A phantasmal gardenia note drenches the composition in its candied, salty cream cheese nuance. No gardenia listed, of course, but trust me on this one. If you like the pungent, Indian-style cornucopia of oily yellow flowers that is Strangelove NYC\u2019s lostinflowers, it is likely that you will also take to this dirty-sexy-money take on the pristine white blouse of muguet.\nSource of samples: I purchased samples from Al Haramain, Universal Perfumes and Cosmetics, the Perfume Parlour, Bruno Acampora, Olivine Atelier, Sixteen92, Alkemia, Solstice Scents, and Mellifluence. The samples from Sultan Pasha were sent to me free of charge by the brand. The samples from Henry Jacques and Aloes of Ish were from friends or Basenotes sample passes.\nThe fact that something as weird and borderline confrontational as Anamcara by Parfums Dusita was workshopped in a Facebook group known for its strict \u2018say something nice or don\u2019t say anything at all\u2019 policy is hilarious to me. This is a humongous, syrupy fruity-floral that lurches at you with a pina colada in one hand and a baseball bat in the other. Though striking, it is more feral than pretty. Think less Juliette Binoche and more B\u00e9atrice Dalle.\nIf you are familiar with the pungency of some floral absolutes in the raw, like jasmine, with its grapey nail solvent highnotes, or ylang, with its banana fuel-spill aspect, then you\u2019re going to love Anamcara, because it features a massive overload of natural orange blossom. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with just how jolie laide naturals can smell or are new to the more artistic corners of niche-dom in general, however, Anamcara could be something of a shibboleth.\nBecause this is not the polite orange blossom of, say, Orange Blossom (Jo Malone) or Eau des Sens (Diptyque). Rather, this is the weirdly medicinal gunk of cough syrups, hard-boiled orange throat lozenges, and vitamin C gummy bears sold in rickety little apothecaries all throughout Provence. It reminds me very much of a holiday in Uz\u00e8s, where everything from the ice-cream, honey, and chocolate to the bread (gibassier) seemed to be expensively infused with orange blossom or lavender essences and hyrosols. I think of this perfumey oddness as distinctly French.\nIn Anamcara\u2019s opening notes, I smell a dense \u2018brown\u2019 floral syrup diluted with a pour of carbonated water for an uplift that reminds me of the orangey Coca Cola fizz of Incense Ros\u00e9 (Tauer). This is shot through with the fresh, lime-green bite of petitgrain, which also smells very French to me, recalling the openings to both Eau Sauvage and Diorella (Dior) as well as the later Mito (Vero Kern). I can\u2019t think of anything that smells quite like Anamcara in its totality, though. I suppose that Rubj (Vero Kern again) in eau de parfum format is the fragrance that comes the closest, in terms of a shared focus on the medicinal \u2018boiled sweet\u2019 aspect of orange blossom. But where Rubj piles on the sensuality with a shocking cumin seed note, Anamcara focuses on the weirdness of orange blossom alone. There is also a savory or umami element to Anamcara, possibly from the sandalwood, that reads as more Asian than European.\nIf I had a criticism, it would be that Anamcara is overdosed (on something) to the point of being oppressive, a monolith of floral muck so densely muscled that it\u2019s hard to make out the shape of any of the tendons or veins. This will be somebody\u2019s idea of floral bliss, no doubt, just not mine. I can\u2019t wear fragrances like this \u2013 they wear me down, defying my attempt to parse them out. I do, however, respect the hell out of Pissara Umavijani\u2019s refusal to color inside the lines on this one. Despite the \u2018rainbows and unicorns\u2019 vibe of its origin story, Anamcara will push buttons as well as boundaries.\nNote: As widely reported, Anamcara translates roughly to \u2018soul friend\u2019 in Irish (and Scots Gaelic, which is similar), though \u2018soul mate\u2019 is probably closer in modern parlance. As an Irish person (and Irish speaker) myself, I can tell you that the vocative form of \u2018cara\u2019 is used very often in day to day speech, i.e., \u2018mo chara\u2019 to say \u2018yo my fine friend\u2019 and \u2018a chara\u2019 to mean Dear Sir/Modom when writing a letter to the Irish Times complaining that last week\u2019s crossword puzzle was wrong or that the banks are running this country into the ground, etc. So it\u2019s funny to see these words appear on a fancy French perfume.\nSource of sample: Sent to me free of charge by the brand.

        "passage": "Breakthroughs are deceptive. When I finally found the few first yellow floral perfumes I loved \u2013 first Amouage\u2019s Ylang-forward Ubar, then Guerlain\u2019s Embruns D\u2019Ylang \u2013 I was certain I had discovered a new favorite perfume genre. There was something intoxicating about the bold, almost-overwhelming floral bodies of those perfumes; they ride the fine line between lush and bombastic. However, the more yellow florals I tested, the more I drifted away. When you\u2019re sampling concoctions that hinge on precise balance, the smallest misstep can render an otherwise beloved perfume unwearable.\nRecently, Diptyque\u2019s Eau Moheli found its way out of my sample jar and reignighted my interest in yellow florals. Here is a yellow floral perfume that is anything but bold. Diptyque is known for their natural, well-balanced concotions, and Eau Moheli fills the bill as well as any yellow floral perfume could. The real question is whether such balance and restraint lead to delight or boredom.\nYet another misleading notes list enters the fray. At first glance, Eau Moheli looks like a mainstream winner disguised as a floral. Ginger, pink pepper, vetiver, benzoin and patchouli spell out \u2018crowd-friendly woody-spicy\u2019 in capital letters. To be fair, it\u2019s not far from the truth. Eau Moheli\u2019s essential curveball lies in the pairing of such ordinary with a bold, unmistakable floral note. It\u2019s suitable for any person who pairs their suits with kaleidoscopic ties that somehow just work.\nWhich is to say \u2013 Eau Moheli just works. This is the rare sort of floral that can dodge the inevitable \u2018it smells like my grandma\u2019 comments online. It\u2019s a light, yet grounded, floral perfume that is undoubtedly beyond gender, and it could pass itself off easily as either a beachside safety pick or a leftfield gym scent.\nAs a light fragrance, Eau Moheli leans toward its top notes. Wearers looking forward to a lush vetiver-patchouli-incense base are sure to be disappointed. Rather, the sharper elements of those notes provide balance against the full-bodied prettiness of the ylang-ylang. The ginger and pepper are also welcome additions to the fray, adding a spicy element that never comes off as piercing or aggressive. Elegance is the main result here. The originality of the composition keeps that elegance on the right side of the pleasant/boring dichotomy.\nIt feels strange to recommend a fragrance both as a safe pick and as an experimental detour, but Eau Moheli checks both boxes. For the floral-hesitant, it provides a lovely intro to the genre. Meanwhile, floral fans are likely to find its unconventionally masculine base a welcome take on the genre. Will it blow you away? Probably not. But will it fit a niche in your wardrobe you didn\u2019t even know existed? Probably so. And most importantly, you\u2019re likely to enjoy it no matter which box it ends up ticking.\nEau Moheli can be sampled here or purchased here.\nEau Moheli is an exquisitely balanced floral perfume grounded in a classically masculine base.\nJade is the Lifestyle Editor at the Fandomentals, where they obsess over perfume and underground music.

They take you through a journey of the materials considered as luxuries during each time period, associated with each of the empires in turn: \u201cBronze for the Assyrians; Phoenicians and their incredible scale at carving ivory; the Babylonians and their desire for precious stones; the Achaemenides who loved gold, and Greek glass,\u201d says Fletcher.\nCertainly, one of the most impressive exhibits within An Age of Luxury is the gilded fish-shaped flask for perfumed oil (above) from the legendary Oxus treasure, discovered in the banks of the River Oxus in the 19th century \u2014 the largest hoard of Achaemenid gold and silver ever found.\nIt starts from a dark era of the Middle Ages, when as the Assyrian Empire rose in power, they pillaged and sacked cities in their path to conquer land and establish rule \u2014 mainly after bronze cauldrons and expensive furniture. You\u2019ll find in the show a number of cast handles often shaped in animal heads, silver tributes as a form of protection money from their conquered lands, and clay texts and palace reliefs telling of their won battles, with translations available in English and Cantonese with a quick QR code scan on your phone. There are also tablet screens for you to zoom into artefacts and look at more detailed renderings and animations of the pieces.\nYou\u2019ll also find remnants of palace decor, from rosette carved flooring to furniture decorated with lion\u2019s feet, or elaborate military ornamentation for guards and soldiers in everything from horse bridles to bows and arrow cases.\nNext, the exhibition also looks at the Phoenician Empire in the several centuries before it fell in roughly 539 B.C. \u2014 they had their territory squeezed westward by oncoming Assyrian forces to the east, and hence spread their talent in making and trading luxury goods across the Mediterranean and North Africa. During this time of movement where Greek powers were also expanding upwards to the Black Sea and Europe, the Phoenicians were particularly skilled at making carved natural items such as decorated ostrich eggs \u2014 an excellent porous drinking vessel that cooled the liquid it contained; fluted seashell cosmetics containers for precious oils; and decorated ivories. Before glassblowing was even invented, this civilisation already created brightly coloured glass perfume bottles, often filled with prized frankincense and myrrh, traded through from Arabia.\nThese days, you might compare these to the hand-painted labels on Buly 1803 cosmetic bottles; the highly sought after scents by Tom Ford and Diptyque, shirts and ties from Herm\u00e8s and more.\n\u201cA lot of the material were owned by kings\u2026 upper classes, the people who had the ear of the king, and held high positions in the military,\u201d Fletcher tells us, \u201cbut I wanted to include some of the more ordinary people in this show.\u201d But what happened back then when you couldn\u2019t afford to have the best of the best? Like people still do now, interestingly, you faked it. As Dr. Fletcher shared, during times of Assyrian control, even when states were at war, you made yourself look like an Assyrian to show wealth and status. Similarly, one of the most iconic markers of the rich in Phoenician society was if you could wear fabrics dyed in a luscious, \u2018Tyrian purple\u2019 \u2014 apparently only achieved with 12,000 of a specific breed of sea snail. You could fake this purple \u2014 there\u2019s a clay tablet on show depicting a recipe to faking this special purple dye.\nAnother marker of wealth was if you kept a well-manicured garden. A sculptured relief from the North Palace of Ashurbanipal (668\u2013631 B.C.) in what is northern Iraq today shows luxurious hills, artificial streams filled with fish, game for hunting, and a mix of coniferous and deciduous trees \u2014 expensive to maintain, of course.\nThanks to these carefully curated gardens, royals could also gain access to the freshest of produce. In a section dedicated to fine dining, other pottery and clay tablets feature kings feasting on grapes and fresh pomegranates being served, expensive incense being burned, surrounded by musicians and dancers. And for those wine lovers out there, there\u2019s a slice of spotlight for you too: with Greek vessels portraying an Achaemenid ruler represented as the God Dionysus \u2014 the patron of wine, feasting and hedonism \u2014 who is said to have travelled to the East where the Achaemenides came from, and learned about wine, bringing the culture back to Greece. Achaemenides were notorious for their wine consumption, with animal-headed cups holding the equivalent of two bottles of wine in one, and a plethora of wine-drinking paraphernalia from silver lades and strainers to expensive silver vessels hammered from a single sheet.\nThe show rounds off with a section on Alexander the Great\u2019s conquest: where his lands eventually stretched from the Mediterranean to India, thus spreading eastern ideas of religion westwards, while also bringing Greek culture and political rule over the whole Middle East. Merging and moulding the diversity of cultures to a predominantly Greek culture, it\u2019s all reflected in the precious materials, jewellery styles, and stonework seen across the region during this era, in an early feat of globalisation.\nWith stories and artefacts describing how different civilisations appropriated from each other, and how precious items were painstakingly crafted with the advanced technology at the time, An Age of Luxury is certainly worth a long afternoon of browsing at the Museum. The exhibition runs through 3 September 2018.<|endoftext|>"

And right now, with flights cancelled and lockdowns everywhere, recall is all we have to take us safely away from it all.\nFrom French fields of lavender to the far-flung sands of Tahiti, here are seven fragrances that transport us away from the confines of our socially distanced bubbles.\nNot all candles are created equal. Most use paraffin wax\u2014a chemically bleached petroleum waste product\u2014which means your flame churns out carcinogens when lit. Which then just means a whole different level of stress (if the coronavirus doesn\u2019t kill you, cancer will) and the whole point of this exercise is to lower your stress levels.\nEnter Vancouver-based MIFA and Co., a plant-based, all-natural (free from fillers, toxins, fragrances and synthetics) bath-and-body-care line, with their new soy wax Cardamom Noir candle. Scented with 100% pure essential oils means zero synthetic smells\u2014one whiff of its pure cardamom and you\u2019re instantly transported to the western ghats of southern India. Cardamom\u2019s aromatherapy benefits include improved concentration, soothed nerves and, in Ayurvedic medicine, the treatment of depression. Vetiver and cedarwood round out the journey.\nIn pre-COVID times, more people used to visit Hawaii in one week than all year in Bora Bora. But with Tosca\u2019s Bora Bora room diffuser, you can book your one-way ticket to paradise all without having to brave public transit over the Pacific.\nThe warm vanilla diffuser evokes the heady scent of French Polynesia with its hints of jasmine, peony, floral bergamot and white tea flower all married with velvety vanilla and sandalwood. Infused with a mandarin aquatic note that\u2019s inspired by turquoise lagoons, the only thing missing now is the overwater bungalow.\nIf you\u2019re suffering from Coronasomnia, you\u2019re not alone. Managing the macro stress (will we all die from this world pandemic?) to the micro (will there be enough toilet paper to go around?) means the ability to hit the hay soundly often takes a hit.\nWith L\u2019Occitane en Provence\u2019s new Cocon de S\u00e9r\u00e9nit\u00e9 Relaxing Pillow Mist, sleep the sleep of angels in southern France\u2019s lavender fields. Mixed with sweet orange and geranium, this 100-percent-natural botanical spray features essential oils that help promote relaxation, well being and fragrant bedtime bliss.\nWith Diptyque\u2019s Dos Son perfumed bird brooch, you can take those basic errand runs and turn them into flights of fancy.\nInspired by Renaissance perfumed jewellery like rings and pomanders (when opportunities to shower were scant, after all), this little pin hides a perfumed disk that discreetly slides in behind. All day long, enjoy the diffused scent of Do Son, a scent imagined by one of Diptyque\u2019s founders. Yves Coueslant spent his childhood summers in Do Son in Along Bay, Vietnam, where a sea breeze carried the spicy nose of tuberose; this fragrance evokes the delicateness and persistence of that childhood memory.\nThe bright lights of the big city have all but dimmed of late with theatres closed everywhere. But if you\u2019ve been binge-watching The Crown recently, you\u2019ve undoubtedly been enjoying a peek behind the dramatic curtain of the royal family. And the Jo Malone English Pear & Freesia Room Spray captures just the right Anglophile note\u2014upper crust without the uppity.\nThe sensuous but mellow freshness of just-ripe King William pears and delicate white freesia dovetail with amber, patchouli and woods for an autumn scent straight from the heart of the English countryside. Close your eyes and take a jolly good walk in an orchard all without having to don wellies or a waistcoat.\nIf you\u2019ve been wearing the same sweat suit for the past week, we wouldn\u2019t fault you. If you\u2019ve been wearing the same underwear, however, it may be time for a talk. Or, rather, time for Effleure\u2019s new scented lingerie.\nCanadian founder Virginia Marcolin brings her role as former lingerie buyer for London\u2019s tony Selfridges department store to the table in her new venture as lingerie designer. These lacy underthings elevate standard-issue sex shop fodder to upscale goods suitable for undergarment drawers everywhere\u2014in lieu of scented drawer sachets, your undergarments become the sachet themselves.\nSubtly perfumed with 100% natural essential oil free of carcinogens and metals\u2014think of it as safe as taking a bubble bath\u2014means your unmentionables become sexy talking points. Or sexy points of departure: black coconut evokes the sun-kissed feeling of a tropical vacation 2020-style.\nSometimes getting away from it all is as simple as hopping in your car. With BC-based Saje\u2019s car diffuser, your staycation becomes a breath of fresh air with the scent of just the right essential oils.\nIn limited-edition holiday packaging, the Road Trip Kit car diffuser clips on your car vent (and works both in hot and cold air) to blow the fragrant Refresh mix of spearmint, lavender, lemon, eucalyptus and cedarwood.

        "passage": "Image from Fragrantica.\nHappy (late!) Valentine\u2019s Day! If you got something lovely to smell, do tell me in comments.\nI was wandering around Bloomingdales, sniffing, and it occurred to me: I think I started blogging about perfume in the spring of 2006 \u2026 ten years ago. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been ten years \u2013 it seems like two years and 50, simultaneously.\nLike old people nattering fondly (and irritatingly) about How Things Used To Be, I miss those heady days of falling headfirst into L\u2019Artisan and Guerlain and Serge Lutens. Exploring those lines, there were scents I didn\u2019t care for, but mostly they were interesting. There were fewer flankers. There was more time to prowl. The steady stream of new scents hadn\u2019t become the flood-prone river it is now.\nAnyway, wandering the perfume aisles just before Valentine\u2019s day was good, because the SAs were too busy with paying customers to bother with me in my jeans and ratty wool cardigan.  If the experience were a cartoon, there\u2019d be me with this vaguely pink, cotton-candy-ish patch of nothingness in the thought bubble over my head. I\u2019ll inflict those on you in a Valentine Candy post in a week or two. In the meantime\u2026.\nJo Malone has a huge display at our local Bloomies. JM always appealed to me more in theory than in practice \u2013 they have some interesting note combinations, and I like the fact that you\u2019re encouraged to layer different scents (and yes, I grasp the money-making concept there, but it\u2019s playful.) The few JMs I\u2019ve bought over the years, however, have ended up either swapped away or sold.\nWhat drew me over was the darling bottles in herbal set \u2013 The Herb Garden \u2014 I\u2019ll probably talk about them next week. Today, though, lets talk about the new Orris & Sandalwood Cologne Intense. The nose behind this fragrance is Pierre Negrin. Notes are violet, orris and sandalwood, and it\u2019s being marketed as unisex, if you care.\nThat\u2019s a pretty straightforward list, right? And it sums the scent up nicely. The opening is unmistakeably orris \u2013 toward the violet-floral end, not the rooty bits \u2013 and then the violet sweetness fades while the sandalwood glides in seamlessly, creating a scent perfectly balanced between floral and woody, all the way through the drydown.\nThis is one of their \u201cintense\u201d scents, and it had quite good lasting power on me. I\u2019m still wondering if I fell and hit my head, though, because I think it\u2019s fabulous. It\u2019s very smooth. It seems like it should belong to a different line, although I can\u2019t quite decide (Diptyque, maybe?) It\u2019s not as epic as Lutens\u2019 Iris Silver Mist; less floral than AdP Iris Nobile; richer than the Prada; and more graceful than Hermes Hiris. (It\u2019s also vastly different from JM Iris & White musk LE, which was much too powdery/musky for me.) It\u2019s a simple mash-up of iris and sandalwood, and as such, truly, it\u2019s lovely. At $170 for 100 ml, it didn\u2019t catapult to the top of my to-buy list, but it\u2019s one of the nicest scents I\u2019ve stumbled upon in some time, particularly from such a mainstream outfit, and if I could have left with a free bottle of fragrance from any display that day, Orris & Sandalwood is what I\u2019d have chosen.\nRead more from Negrin talking about the scent here on the JM website.\nPrevious Article\u2190 Love-ly weekend: What says \u2018romantic\u2019 to you?\nIf you could've left with a free bottle, this is what you'd have chosen because it's so nice? Or because the bar was set so low? I like the Earl Grey scent JM makes, but not enough to buy it. I've been looking for a good basil-based scent, and it still eludes me, but I bought a bottle of the JM Lime & Basil which was disappointing.\nWish I'd bought Peony & Moss when it was available.\nI have a Jo Malone jinx - if I like a scent, they discontinue it. Honeysuckle and Jasmine is one of my all time favorites (I have a backup bottle, fortunately). I liked their Verbena scent a lot - no bottle, alas. I gave the Orris and Sandalwood a quick sniff as I was passing by over the weekend, but I should try it on skin. Iris isn't really my thing but I swoon over a good sandalwood!\nThanks for the review! I wasn't as taken by Orris and Sandalwood when I tried it in the store, but I'll give it a try on my skin next time I'm in. I also like the idea of layering fragrances, but I've kept away from Jo Malone because I've heard there are issues with longevity. Instead, I've been yearning for their candles.\nI've never tried any of Jo Malone's offerings. Just never was into her offerings, they just sounded boring.\nHave to say I'm with you on JM in general--love the concept, love the intriguing combinations, LOVE the elegant packaging (and the stand-alone shops are gorgeous), but the juice itself has always been<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " aligns with your own? If not, what do you want your fragrance to say about you?\nIt aligns with my moods and sometimes can set the scene for my own imagination. But I wouldn\u2019t say fragrance aligns with my personality. I don\u2019t really want it to say anything about me these days, it\u2019s for my pleasure first\u2014I\u2019m pretty adamant about that. I do think about how it will remind three specific people I love (my husband, my kids) of me years down the line.\nWhat was your path to becoming a perfumer? Was there a particular moment that made you take a leap into fragrance?\nWhat has been one of your favorite collaborations to date?\nI loved working with Opening Ceremony. Their teams always had great ideas and input, but let me lead and do my thing. They were only a pleasure to work with. I did four sets of scent layering pallets with them in 2014 and launched my astrological candles with them in 2018.\nNot only does Nova produce custom fragrances for individuals and clients in addition to the signature line\u2014but you also put out otherworldly candles. Each candle in your collection corresponds to a group of astrological signs (fire, earth, air, water) Can you talk about your approach to making these signs into unique candle scents?\nThank you for this thoughtful question! I wanted to capture at least one character trait of each trio of signs that fall under each element. The sophistication of Capricorn translated to a suede note, the dreaminess of Pisces translated into rice milk, the Venus in Libra became rose, the aggressiveness of Aries translated to clove, etc. There was a lot of crossover given the commonalities of each trio, but there were tricky moments where I had to lean into a direction more than one of the obvious characteristics of a sign was highlighted. I channeled the softness of Scorpio for example, in order to get Water Signs to a harmonious place. I also very much kept in mind that the element itself needed to come through.\nOn that note (no pun intended) what\u2019s your sign and do you feel like you\u2019re aligned with what it implies?\nI\u2019m Capricorn sun, Scorpio rising, Pisces moon, and yes, I am mostly aligned with those signs. That said, my chart has Taurus and Sag dominance with almost no air\u2014this also makes sense.\nDo you have any favorite notes or notes you\u2019ve come to love over the years as you\u2019ve expanded your own library?\nTOO MANY! I do think one of the most comforting raw materials that I always looooove to smell is Balsam Fir absolute. It\u2019s this thick, delicious, balm-esque material. It\u2019s cozy and sweet, but not saccharine. It\u2019s warm, delectable, beautiful, and earthly, but also with an airy element. It\u2019s a total healing note that wraps me up and makes me feel like I\u2019m being hugged. Ugggg, it\u2019s amazing!\nWhat trends have you noticed at the end of 2020 coming into 2021? Do you feel like more people are embracing fragrance than ever before as a transportive experience?\nI do feel like people are embracing it as transportive and using it nostalgically\u2014I certainly am. I\u2019m currently re-buying old favorites. In winter I re-bought Thierry Mugler\u2019s Angel after many years, and also got Angel Muse while I was at it. I was surprised that Angel Muse is much more wearable to me. Then I was craving gourmande again, which is funny because I saw your last interview with Servideo who said the same thing. Gourmande in the time of Covid-19 makes sense.   Market wise trends\u2014I\u2019m seeing a lot of dupe companies popping up which I suppose says a lot about how mainstream \u201cniche\u201d, and certain cult luxury fragrances, have become thanks to IG, YouTube and I assume TikTok. I\u2019m also seeing so many \u201cclean\u201d fragrances around at Sephora and in Target. The big come up of clean beauty retailers like Credo, is telling, and the level of transparency people demand.\nWhat\u2019s in your current collection? Are there any niche fragrance houses you\u2019re drawn to right now?\nWeirdly I feel like I am just getting started with my collection. I have a big catalog in my memory, but not nearly as much in my cabinet as I would like. I had a long period of not really wearing fragrances or buying new ones. There are a few reasons that I can go into if you want, otherwise I\u2019ll just say I\u2019m very happy to be out of that phase because it sucked. To answer your question though, Byredo was so influential in terms of me wanting to become a perfumer. Olivia Giacobetti is such a legend, so I\u2019m a Byredo loyalist even though it\u2019s now under a much larger group. Recent niche buys reflect the seasons I bought them. In summer 2020 I bought Untitled by Margiela and the classic Diptyque Philosykos (Giacobetti again).\nThose were old ones I had been meaning to get. Winter 2020 when I bought them, Memo Inl\u00e9 was somewhat new to my memory and is beautiful. A new one for me is Cafe Tuberosa from Atelier Cologne who I briefly worked for. This launch is a dream. The blend of coffee beans with Tuberose spices and cacao makes me feel like the Mom I want to be, going to get pastries on the weekend and leaving lipstick kisses on my kids\u2019 cheeks. I love Parfums de Marly Oajan, I wore it around Christmas. It\u2019s another walking pastry fragrance.  I also really want to build a collection of the best celebrity fragrances, which isn\u2019t niche but is A niche.\nWhat do you want to see change in the fragrance industry?\nI would love for there to be stricter guidelines and more repercussions for misleadingly calling any fragrance product, be it a personal fragrance, a candle, whatever, \u201cNATURAL\u201d. It\u2019s the same problem with food labels. This is obviously a moral responsibility\u2014when I see companies (big ones, small ones) or any type of consultant in the fragrance field using technical loopholes in order to print the word \u201cnatural\u201d in a slant way it gets my goat, because people believe what they read. Why wouldn\u2019t they? Why would they know how unregulated the industry can be? The wrong info gets into the mouths of store owners and sales people and the minds of beauty editors, and it gets to be a lot of false info circulating. I have seen round-ups by editors that were way off base, and I\u2019ve seen stores mistakenly stocking the \u201cwrong\u201d products for their ethos. Companies should be forced to spell out and back up these types of claims.\nCheck out more of Julia\u2019s work here.
