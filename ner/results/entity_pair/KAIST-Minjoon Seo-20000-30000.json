The tech goliath disclosed this today at the ongoing Samsung AI Forum 2022.\nSamsung AI Forum is an annual AI event hosted by Samsung Electronics where world-renowned academics, researchers, and industry experts will come together to share their insights on the future of artificial intelligence, AI.\nCurrently, the event is hosted at the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology with over 1,200 attendees. This year, Samsung AI Forum begins today, November 8th, and will conclude tomorrow, November 9th. This is the first time in three years that the event will be held in person due to the emergence of the novel coronavirus.\nUnder the theme of \u201cShaping the Future with AI and Semiconductor,\u201d Samsung AI experts discuss the future direction of AI research that will create new milestones in AI-based semiconductor and material innovation.\nProfessor Yoshua Bengio of the University of Montreal, Canada, shared his latest research in a keynote presentation, \u201cWhy We Need Amortized, Causal and Bayesian World Models.\u201d In causal models for AI that investigate theories and plan experiments in the realm of science and general AI, he emphasized the use of amortized inference and the Bayesian approach.\nMeanwhile, in his opening remarks, Jong-Hee (JH) Han, Vice Chairman, CEO, and Head of the Device Experience (DX) Division at Samsung Electronics, said AI technology would provide better convenience and new experiences for all.\nIn the \u201cAI for R&D Innovation\u201d session, research leaders at SAIT, including the Executive Vice President and Head of SAIT\u2019s AI Research Center, Changkyu Choi, shared the status and vision of Samsung\u2019s research on AI. In particular, they talked about how AI technology will affect industries like semiconductors and material development.\nMinjoon Seo, a professor at KAIST, and Hyunoh Song, a professor at Seoul National University, gave a presentation on the most recent research accomplishments in AI algorithms in a session titled \u201cRecent Advances of AI Algorithms.\u201d This included a large language model-based interface for ultra-accurate semantic search.\nHowever, according to the firm, day two is themed \u201cScaling AI for the Real World.\u201d There Samsung is expected to share the development direction of future AI technologies that will significantly affect our lives, including hyperscale AI, digital humanities, and robotics.\nSebastian Seung, President and Head of Samsung Research will give a keynote on the \u201cfirst steps of an effort to improve upon classical brain theories by optimizing biologically plausible unsupervised learning algorithms\u201d and a welcoming remark.\nProfessor Terrence Sejnowski of the University of California San Diego in the United States, who founded NeurIPS, the most prestigious AI conference in the world, will speak about the intelligence of hyper-scale language models based on experimental studies examining the existence of intelligence in hyper-scale language models.\nIn all, professor Seungwon Hwang of Seoul National University will talk about how causality, evidentiality, and other types of information can be used to strengthen hyper-scale language models. Participants will also have the chance to view several demos and research posters created by the Global AI Center at the booth, where they may speak with the researchers in person.<|endoftext|>"
