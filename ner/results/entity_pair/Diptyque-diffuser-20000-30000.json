        "passage": "s back. The legs, too, are connected diagonally to the seat surface. It\u2019s lightweight yet sturdy, and perfect for those who like a simple seat without the bells and whistles.\nDutch designer-artist Maarten Baas is known for his rebellious style, and this Victorian-style armchair is striking evidence of that. Its beauty is due to a strange production process involving burning wood, a result of his fascination with fire. The burnt wood is finished with epoxy resin, and the chair features fire-retardant foam and leather upholstery. The Smoke collection was named in The New York Times\u2019 Top 25 Design Classics of the Future, in 2012.\nThis distinctive tall lounge chair is defined by a steam-bent solid beech structure that wraps around woven cane on either side. The wide seat is in a similar upholstery to the backrest\u2019s centre that extends above the head, creating a spacious hideout for the person who wants an escape from surrounding distractions. This cosy seat is a good fit for those who are easily disturbed.\nThis inviting lounge chair won the coveted \u201cGold Leaf\u201d distinction at the International Furniture Design Competition Ashahikawa in Japan 12 years ago. Based on traditional boat-manufacturing techniques, 28 curved pieces of ash wood slide into position to form a spacious curved shell. No mean feat. But it\u2019s also a work of art \u2013 users can move the wood pieces to achieve different shapes \u2013 say, for a raw jagged-edged look, or a relaxing rounded appearance. You\u2019d be tempted to crawl in for a cosy siesta. It is also easily dismantled.\nSink into this plush Mongolian lamb-wool chair if it\u2019s a cosy embrace you long for, while slaying monstrous work challenges in the digital realm. Designed by a leading Italian architect, the chair rests securely on three large tubular legs whose colours can be swopped for a touch of liveliness. It is also available in fabric and leather.\nNobody says work must be done in a study. If you prefer working near a window on one of your house\u2019s multiple landings, get a work desk (or work desks, if you have a nomadic working style). For those sequestered at home with family, a longer desk offers the motivational energy of having company.\nThis classy personal desk is perfect for a home study or studio office. The wood-veneered top comes in Natural Ash, Carbon Stained Ash or Walnut Stained Ash and can be paired with classy finishes such as Gold Chrome, Metallic Brass and Satin Black. These finishes cover the swivel drawers, contrasting feet and the cable management port. If graceful refinement is your design spirit animal, this has your name on it.\nFounded by Singaporean designer Nathan Yong, Folks pays tribute to traditional carpentry work by Asian craftsmen. This workstation is unique in that it is multifunctional. When telecommuting is no longer necessary, simple repurpose it as a vanity or display sideboard. As a worktop, it is just as nifty, with ample storage. NOT SO SIMPLE This space-saving work desk can be repurposed, when it\u2019s time to return to the office.\nAre you one of those who love the feel of working at the bar counter in a coffeehouse with the bustle all around while you\u2019re plugged into your favourite work playlist? You can re-create that with the Base High Table, which references Scandinavian design. Finnish designer Mika Tolvanen went with a pared-down and sleek look, using clean lines and a simple frame. The handspun aluminium Ambit Rail Lamp by TAF Studio, as well as Nerd bar stools crafted in wood by David Geckeler, pulls the whole look together. Various material and colour options are available.\nPallas is a table that commands attention with its stark geometric angles. The smooth lines of the table turn at unexpected junctures, resulting in a space that compels people to sit closer together, encouraging communication. This is characteristic of the works by award-winning German industrial designer Konstantin Grcic, whose design approach is heavy on geometric forms and hard edges. The powder-coated metal surface is available in 10 colours.\nThe quirky round-edged Nubo is three things in one: a decorative wall-mounted display, a shelf, and a compact desk. Its space-saving design is evocative of a suitcase or treasure box, but it is just as capable for work when open, with a slot for cables and a bracket for documents. The combination of natural oak and woollen textile on the external face will add warmth to any spot in the house. WORK BOX A nifty surface for the executive whose documents are all in the cloud \u2013 and can work off just a laptop.\nBritish architectural designer John Pawson CBE is known for his sense of minimalism, and the Trestle work table is a good example of this. Its simplicity is elegant, but there\u2019s actually a whole host of variations available for those who like customisation. Solid oak legs hold up a table top that comes in eight sizes \u2013 to match the size of your household \u2013 and with three heights (a counter version is available). The surface can be lacquered, or covered in different finishes. Pair with colourful Season chairs to jazz up the mood of a family business meeting.\nThis whimsical booth design is the creation of Danish architect Stine Gam and Italian architect Enrico Fratesi. It\u2019s both visually pleasing and functional, with a lacquered steel chest fixed under the surface to conceal cables. The shell overhead \u2013 made of fibreglass clad in polyether foam \u2013 is soundproof, giving you much- needed privacy for video meetings.\nAnother elegant workstation is this two-tier oval desk, inspired by psychologist Sigmund Freud. It\u2019s a luxe desk, with its marble surfaces (the options are White Carrara, Black Marquinia or Green Guatemala) juxtaposed against a black lacquered metal frame with contrasting brass details.\nThis futuristic looking desk was inspired by fighter planes. Its cantilevered look comprises a spectacular overhang, with a prismatic base. Creative yet professional-looking, this lacquered desk comes in a range of cool hues for the serious executive who doesn\u2019t want to be distracted by bright colours.\nFor illumination, go beyond the utilitarian with these options that range from the poetic and elegant to the peculiar, and which can be easily moved around the home.\nThis avant-garde looking orb is sliced asymmetrically, revealing a brushed brass fascia that is crescent in shape. The full-sized version is the popular Crescent Light, which is a ceiling lamp.\nCreatve director Omer Arbel loves sculptural lighting, and you can tell based on his work with Bocci. The 57 Stem is created by a fabrication process that traps pockets of air in a larger mass of dark grey or white opaline glass. When lit up, the unique shapes of those voids are exposed, and, depending on how active your imagination is, each deformed orb may look like a yakitori stick of pufferfish. The lighting system comes in a brass or black finish.\nIn the day, this floor lamp (also available in pendant lighting) is a puzzling stack of cylindrical glass modules. In the dark, this turns into a mesmerising column of light discs, thanks to the carefully calibrated LED technology integrated into the junctions between each module. The variations are aplenty \u2013 one can opt for single or multiple glass modules, with a glass dome or cone-shaped head for some flair.\nAlthough you are indoors, you can still have wildlife in your midst, with this glowing lamp in the guise of a graceful bird perched on a metal bar. Watch it gently swing at a soft touch.Made of steel and aluminium, this floor lamp is equipped with solid state LED and comes in different heights. Great for adding a whimsical touch to your work environment.\nPortable, efficient yet innovative. This table lamp is capable of shining from both ends; and users can choose between three light options (dim to strong), or adjust the intensity incrementally by turning a dial. Its sleek body of anodised aluminium can be rotated to act as direct lighting, or to cast an ambient glow.\nComplete your work-from-home experience with these accessories and storage options.\nTurn your filing tasks into a creative exercise with this storage option. The modular walnut boxes are versatile stackable units, which you can place beside your pop-up workspaces at home to hide work clutter. VERSATILE These drawer units make accessing your work documents easy, yet look sleek in any space.\nAvailable in three lengths, Bookworm combines creativity and technology. The wall shelf can be arranged flexibly, in circles or waves, yet its toughness and functionality isn\u2019t compromised; the space between each bookend can bear a load of 10kg.\nCreated by New Zealander Andrew Meo and Italian Daniele Berenbruch, and made by craftsmen in a Milan factory, the machine doesn\u2019t just make coffee \u2013 it\u2019s a shining work of art. It also boasts exceptional temperature stability, which means consistent cups of espresso.\nWorkspaces have an inexplicable tendency to accumulate an assortment of bits and bobs. Keep random items sorted with this series of trays. They come in different shapes and sizes, and with various equestrian designs and graphic motifs.\nPleasant scents can enhance productivity. Aside from smelling and looking lovely, Diptyque\u2019s six sculptural Hourglass diffusers double as elegant timers too: The liquid fragrance flows from the top to<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "). Those of you who want to try some, or a small decant, and who know where to find me, feel free to drop me a note! Thanks for the tip, Kevin!\nIf $100 is the new free, doesn\u2019t $35 mean buy 2? LOL kidding!\nI\u2019m so hoping you\u2019ll save me a teeny tiny sample\u2026.but I just can\u2019t imagine anything dislodging Philosykos from my figgy heart.\nDaisy: buy THREE, I\u2019d say! I like the naturalness of this fig very much.\nhush! you just stop that sort of talk!\nWasn\u2019t it Kevin\u2019s fault that you ordered FOUR Balsam de la Mecca (I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right name) bottles?!?\nha! we\u2019re up to 6 now. He wrote the review therefore I get to blame him. This is just how things work in the Daisy-centric universe\u2013haven\u2019t you figured that out yet?\nJoe, you\u2019re welcome\u2026tell me what you think.\nGreat review, and being a huge tree lover I found this to be very interesting \u2013 thank you so much. I wanted to like Philosykos but it had a fairly strong chemical note on my skin. This sounds like it might finally be the fig scent for me.\nthat is so wild Rapple. On me Philosykos is sweet creamy figgy almost floral \u2014all soft and cuddly with an earthy undertone\u2026.love the stuff! I guess you\u2019ll have to console yourself with a dab of 180 Ans\u2026.\nYeah, I\u2019ll try to feel better with the 180 but it will be tough\u2026.. NOT! LOL!\nRappleyea: I smelled a brand new bottle of Philosykos recently and it seemed \u2018different\u2019 to me. I\u2019m praying the bottle was \u201coff\u201d, had been scalded in the sun\u2026etc!\nYou keep telling yourself that Kevin. Don\u2019t even think that ugly \u201cR\u201d word!\nSounds delicious. Note to self: need small decant of Philosykos.\nDissed: glad to have jarred your memory!\nAnother great review Kevin\u2014- for some reason I\u2019m most intrigued by the prospect of a reed diffuser in this\u2026.seems like it\u2019d be yummy and soothing at the same time!\nI was afraid to read your review\u2026..we all know what the Balsamo della Mecca review did to me!! And in case you didn\u2019t know: my splitting ONE bottle has turned into splitting SIX bottles\u2026.you are a dangerous man.\noh good lord\u2026.don\u2019t review them! I can\u2019t afford it!\nohhh, you mean this line \u201cInfusion Organique\u201d whew! ok\u2014-I thought you meant the La Via del Profumo line and was momentarily filled with panic!\nAll hail Kevin, the Lemming King.\nI think I was right behind Joe in the ordering line. Because you can never have enough fig. And it might lead to enlightenment.\nHa! Enlightenment for only $35!! sign me up!\nDaisy: my dear, you WANT, NEED, DESIRE, COVET too much to ever be enlightened!!! HAHAHA!\nAs a brand new perfumista, I sampled many, many perfumes trying to find a fig I can really love. I haven\u2019t found it yet \u2013 so many of them smell too much like fig leaves and not enough of the fruit., or, they smell too milky sweet like you mentioned. Maybe I\u2019ll give this one a try. My other cheap thrills fig is Ex Libris by Tokyo Milk.\nI\u2019ve only sniffed a couple of the Hermes fragrances, but the one that stuck in my mind to try again is Un Jardin en Mediterranee. Maybe it is time for another round of figs.\nJulia: oh, I\u2019ll have to try Ex Libris then\u2026at least a soap or two.\nK \u2013 I\u2019d stick w/the perfume for this one. It\u2019s closer to the Mediterranee end of the fig spectrum; more sharp, less creamy. It really IS good, as cheap thrills go. I\u2019ll be curious to try this one; the Diptyque is much too coconutty-sweet on me.\nSorry, kids distracting\u2026 the first \u201cthis one\u201d above was Ex Libris, and the second the Buddha\u2019s Fig. Gracious.\nI really like Ex Libris; by far the best thing I\u2019ve tried from Tokyo Milk.\nBeautiful review K, I love your writing. It calls to mind the book Siddartha by Herman Hesse, one of my all time faves.\nI think sometimes it\u2019s almost worse when the rave review is for an affordable \u2018fume rather than an extravagant one\u2026 the (relatively) cheap price makes it easier to justify an unsniffed purchase! I mean, $35!?!? How can I NOT afford it!!!\nk-scott: that does seem to be the case!\nThe only figgie I know/own is Artisan\u2019s Premier Figuier \u2013 how do these compare? I sometimes get a bit overwhelmed by a sort of sandalwood/savoury coconut tinge and feel I\u2019d prefer something sweeter but greener.\nJillie: the L\u2019Artisan was never a favorite of mine and I\u2019ve not smelled it in years. It was very watery on me. Maybe someone else has smelled it recently and can comment.\nI\u2019d happily give you mine if I lived in the States!\nMy Sweetie has a wonderful pipe tabacco that has a sweet virginia tabacco and ( I swear I\u2019m not making this up) a sort of fresh fig newton scent. Now that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for! Not milky/sweet so much as jammy/rich. It\u2019s a great blend and to be honest if I could find a fragrance that captured those notes I\u2019d be all over it..or it would be all over me, I guess.\nThere is something about pipe tobacco wafting through a room, a sensual scent you want to keep breathing in. Why it hasn\u2019t been captured is puzzling, but then again, I\u2019m a \u2018relatively\u2019 new perfumista. Maybe an elder could enlighten us? I\u2019m sitting in lotus pose until further word. I\u2019m definitely going to try OBF.\nMeadowBliss: I\u2019ll have to think a bit\u2026a straightforward pipe tobacco\u2026.\nMomLady, sounds like something Serge Lutens would make!\nYes, he should. Using Mac Baron\u2019s Cube or even W.O.Larson\u2019s Old Fashioned pipe tabaccos as reference scents! I don\u2019t know that it even has to approximate lit tabacco..these smell so yummy just filling the pipe.\nOrganic fig? I stand in line. Fun thing to give it to my brother who is a yoga teacher. Has to be organic then, he cares a lot about that.\nMYBB: this sounds perfect for him!<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Diptyque Paris has been synonymous with adding refined fragrance into everyday life since 1961. From luxurious home fragrance to refined candles and bespoke perfume, the French Maison has kept reinventing itself while expanding its portfolio throughout the years. Celebrating it\u2019s 60 year anniversary last year with a festive collection of products we all know and love, 2022 marks the embarkment on a new journey and into a brand new product category: Household cleaning. Starting off with a line of 5 products: A dishwashing liquid, multi-surface cleaner, leather and wood care lotion, perfumed ceramic, and true to the house, an odour-absorbing candle that you can light after cooking. Being a traditional house with modern values, the bottles are refillable and made from recycled glass, while the products are biodegradable and made from 99% natural ingredients.\n\u201cSwept along by the imagination of its founders and their innate sense of beauty, the Maison diptyque takes delight in inventing new ways of perfuming your days while adding enchantment to your evenings. Giant candles for indoors and outdoors, scented wax ovals and diffusers for the car to name a few, have introduced sophisticated accords to contexts where, though unexpected, have proven most welcome. Here, fresh notes courtesy of Baies. There, the woody fragrance of Figuier. A daily inspiration, and a pleasure that\u2019s always fresh and new.\nPresenting the arrival of La Droguerie, a fresh companion to diptyque\u2019s perfumed creations, complete with assorted turns, twists and sideways steps. A full collection of household cleaning products, an invitation to care for the interior of your home, blending beauty with utility and sensual enjoyment with respect for the environment. An evolution, possibly even a domestic mini-revolution: satisfaction need no longer wait for the sight of a job well done. The fine objects in this collection are pleasing to the eye, while its fragrances send the imagination roaming.\nThe olfactory compositions in La Droguerie were born out of Diptyque\u2019s perfuming expertise. Their essences, picked one by one from the Maison\u2019s herbarium of scents, bring their unique, delicate accords to the practical tasks of everyday life. Hour by hour, from kitchen to laundry room, from bedroom to living room, a pleasing stroll amid fig trees and orange blossom, accompanied by bouquets of basil or polished wood.\nresponsibility as highly as it does the beauty of its objects and the sensual enjoyment they provide. Its formulations, contents and fragrances keep all these promises \u2013 now and in the long term.\nThe liquid formulations comprise ingredients that are 99% natural, or of natural origin and are biodegradable. With the exception of the Anti-Odour Candle, they are all accredited by Ecocert, the global specialist in the certification of sustainable practices. They respect the environment and human health but needless to say, without any loss of performance.\nThe amber bottles in the La Droguerie collection are made of recycled glass. They can also be refilled quite easily, from refill containers that are themselves 100% recyclable. One simple motion, and they\u2019re full again. Sold without box or instruction leaflet, each year these refills save an average of two tonnes of paper along with a significant amount of ink. The Ceramic Oval for wool and delicate textiles with cedar wood can also be refilled in a moment. Enduring beauty combined with reduced waste.\nFound in the Diptyque Droguerie is a dishwashing liquid with orange blossom, cleaning brush, a multi-surface cleaner with vinegar, a leather and wood care lotion with beeswax, a ceramic oval for wool or delicate textures with cedar wood, and an anti-odour candle with basil.\nDiptyque and La Droguerie are available in the Diptyque store in Amsterdam, at Skins Cosmetics, and on diptyqueparis.com.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "No matter how I am feeling, nothing gives me the confidence boost that smelling great does. I absolutely adore a fine fragrance.\nStanding in a coffee queue, in a lift or passing by complete strangers I have frequently been complimented on my fragrance. Now as you know I am in my fifties (just) so there is clearly not any ulterior motive and the compliments certainly appear to be genuine. I certainly take them in the spirit of flattery and I am a grateful recipient. A compliment particularly about the way you smell to others can give you a great lift for your entire day.\nSo what is it that she wears, I hear you ask, that attracts so much attention?\nMy general everyday daytime fix for work is Guerlain\u2019s Insolence. Vaguely reminiscent of parma violets and frankly not everyone\u2019s cup of tea but it always smells incredible on me. Every time I wear it you can guarantee someone notices. It makes me feel great and that always gives me such an added confidence. A mid price perfume which attracts high praise from many.\nChanel\u2019s Coco Mademoiselle used to be a firm favourite of mine until my mother switched from No.5 to Mademoiselle a couple of years ago. And while we are only together a few times each month you just can\u2019t go around smelling like your mother, EVER, regardless how good that is! The plus side of this downside is that I always know what gift she will like.\nMy daughter loves the Black Orchid parfum from the Tom Ford collection and it smells spectacular on her skin. Having sampled it myself it is a fabulous scent but as with your mother, you can\u2019t go around smelling like your daughter, EVER. I personally enjoy the more woody and musky perfumes of the Tom Ford collection.\nMy evening selection is usually from one of 3 exceptionally fine fragrance houses.\nI have recently discovered Black Phantom by Kilian Hennessy (yes of Cognac fame) This is a slightly more heavy and provocative fragrance than I am generally used to and find that a small amount is more than sufficient. It\u2019s very rock n roll in the best possible sense with a dark and playful side. It does makes me smile. The packaging is wonderfully theatrical on the macabre side and full of temptation. Some of the perfumes are packaged in evening clutch bags or refillable decanters. This fine fragrance is more than perfume it is dressing table fashion.\nI love the Alaxander McQueen inspiration to this luxury fine fragrance collection. It\u2019s not surprising that Kilian has worked with the likes of McQueen, Armani and Dior as you can sense this in the products. They are full of sophistication, intrigue and excitement. Straight to Heaven is another of the fragrances that smells absolutely divine.\nThis gold serpent on the clutch bag packaging is just wonderfully fun.\nIn the Summer I also came across Diptyque in Fenwick\u2019s refurbished beauty hall in Newcastle. I was originally attracted by their wonderful diffusers and candles until I discovered their range of perfumes. Fabulously French and sophisticated.\nWhat I particularly liked about purchasing a Diptyque fragrance in Fenwick is that you receive an accompanying sample. If you try the sample and discover the scent is not for you, then if you haven\u2019t opened your fragrance you can return it. I personally think this is great marketing. The fragrance that hooked me in was Tam Dao, it is rich and velvety with fabulous woody notes. I also have a sample of L\u2019Ombres dans l\u2019eau, which is a rich berry and rose fragrance. I am saving this one for a special occasion to try it out.\nThe candle, diffuser and perfume collections are also available to buy online here.\nLast but certainly by no means least, and definitely my absolute favourite collection of the moment. I am currently in love with the Frederic Malle collection. Fortunately it is loving me back and there are several of the multitude of fragrances that particularly suit my skin.\nPortrait of a Lady, created for the collection by Dominique Ropion, gives a heady sense of bouquets of roses with hints of patchouli.\nCarnal Flower is another Dominique Ropion fragrance that most people are drawn to with heavy sexual tones of spices and sweetness.\nI am also enjoying Dries Van Noten, created by Bruno Jovanovic, with fabulously deep sandalwood notes.\nI have also recently discovered Noir Epices, created by Michael Roudnitska. This particular fine fragrance is exotic and oriental. Again with woody notes this seems to be really suiting my mood at the moment. There is just so much choice and each fine fragrance has such a wonderful story behind it in this sensational collection. I just don\u2019t have enough nights out in my calendar to do them all justice.\nEven if no one stops to compliment me these perfumes are making me feel absolutely fabulous at the moment and how I feel about myself is all that really matters.\nPrevious Post: There needs to be more mature bloggers. FACT.\nI just love Tom Ford black orchid. I like white patchouli incase the birthday fairy or Santa is on the prowl!\nProud of you for your site?<|endoftext|>"

Roja Dove\u2019s Roja Parfums Leather Bougie is rich, warm and \u2013 as the name suggests \u2013 delightfully leathery. It\u2019s also big on one of my favourite fragrance notes, birch tar \u2013 an ingredient that has a natural affinity with leather since it\u2019s often used to make it waterproof. How does it smell? Well, imagine slipping into stiff new riding boots, straddling an unforgiving leather saddle and galloping off through a Scottish forest at full pelt and you\u2019re kind of halfway to appreciating its rich, manly fabulousness*.\n*Think of me what you will but I really enjoyed writing that last sentence.\nIn the last of my Grooming Guru Awards for 2012 (I know, they do seem to have gone on forever and for that I apologise) I wanted to give an award for my favourite new room fragrance. I\u2019m an absolute scented candle/diffuser/incense stick junkie so it\u2019s always hard for me to pick just one product I really like but this new candle from Byredo I love for several reasons.\nFor starters, I tend to prefer candles with a warm, earthy, woody and slightly mysterious feel (if they smell anything like a smouldering campfire in a secluded forest all the better). Apocalyptic ticks all these boxes thanks to notes of oakmoss, birch wood and fire iron (think hot, smelting metal). It\u2019s similar in vibe to my favourite ever candle, Diptyque\u2019s Feu de Bois, but is subtler and not quite so overwhelming.\nI love it, too, for the deep navy-black wax which reminds me a bit of an ancient obsidian scrying glass when liquid. If indeed, the end of the world is nigh as the Mayans predicted, Apocalyptic will be what\u2019s burning in the background, at my place at least.<|endoftext|>"

Then my mom came and she keep saying that Bebe can't run in the house lol. \nI really dont mind or dont care how big my space was as long as it's somewhere i feel comfortable with and just I suka la. Then bebe also get use to be in my place I'm so happy.  Check toilet la, open window la, then walk here walk there, turn that on turn this on. Open every single door in my house, see what's in my cabinet.  Omg I dont even complain about my place but she's the one keep complaining with my dad.\nSaying this and that then I told my mom like'You see, I'm not honeymoon here one. I'm working' HAHHAHAHA Then she start to believe me. But indeed I'm so happy because my mom finally came to my place and we start to chit chat about the house that i bought. I show her the drawing plan and how I want it to be then my bro and bebe just nap at my house lol.\nWe also unbox the mooncake and enjoy the mooncake with each other. Although my dad didn't make it this time but I'm still really happy about it. So as usual, bebe always like to sleep between my legs since he was 8 months old and now...\nEvery single time I'm working at downstair, he will still act like a baby boy and look how innocent he is. But my leg so numb I can't move at all lol because he is no longer toy poodle size lol.\nI love diffuser a lot. I placed all different kind of diffuser in my toilet, closet room, working area and my sleeping area. This year, I decided to choose a new scent for myself. Yes, not diffuser! I didn't really use fragrance on my body. I love the Chanel perfume, the chance series purple one. That was my favourite since 3 years ago but I never have that kind of'really die die want to buy' mood on that fragrance.\nWhy? Because I know I won't use. I got other perfume like Gucci flora one which I received as a gift from brands and some other 'too mature' scent that I dont really like. I just keep there and sometime I gave it to my mom or Smelly's mom if they want. But I really dont have that kind of time to put it on everyday.\nThen I wanted to be more' girly' lol or feminine, I look at Jo Malone I was like, everyone recommended that to me. I wanna try and the packaging so nice, can use as a props to take photo too. HAHAHAH Then I tried it once until now I haven pick the scent that I love the most. I can't decide until I went to Diptyque first boutique shop @Pavilion, KL few weeks ago.\nI was there to attend their new launch and try their product like body lotion and shampoo. Then I smell one of these scent that I'm so tempted to get. It's the DOSON from Diptyque. Next, I asked the staff like, do you have any perfume that has the same scent like this. They immediately introduce that fragrance for me. It cost me RM639, cost more than Jo Malone then I ask if any smaller size. They introduce me the white lighter scent one which cost me RM399, but the scent last me longer compare to Jo Malone one. Then I thought to get this as my xmas gift lol.\nSo I say nvm, I must stop myself because I'm going to tick my wishlist to get new laptop this end of the year. I must tahan!! But end of the year especially all xmas set = DAMN NICE! Like NARS product and all \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11 Then who know I finally get this. It's my birthday gift from two of my really closed friends. When I unpack it I was like wtf?!!!\nSo now the fragrance placed above my ikea drawer which I can see it everyday and use it. I always pass by perfume corner and ask Smelly try it on and see whether he like or not but he always answer me 'too much la, too strong la, not nice' Then this scent, I never told him before. So during the first time I use, he was like wah, not very strong but very nice this scent.\nI often prefer feminine flora scent which is not too sweet but just nice one. Something like Chanel chances purple one. Or sometime my mood go really well with rose scent but compare with other rose scent from Diptyque, I prefer DOSON. It's the mysterious tuberose amid berries and flowers. A fresh sweetness, like a sea breeze in a pagoda on the banks of the Tonkin Gulf. It's like sleeping on a bed of berries and flowers. Not very strong or to sweet. Just very \u6709\u6c14\u8d28.\nThen after I shared it, lots of dm asking the code or the number. Actually the packaging itself told you everything. But a plus point after Smelly told me I smells good. LOL it's like a life achievement because he always say girl putting perfume is just too much. lol He is a boring bf lol. Then after he told me this, I very scared DOSON out of stock since I use it everyday, I decided to buy some travel size one so I could take it with me during my trip.\nYes, I pass by Diptyque again and went to the shop. Guess what, online got the travel pack but in Malaysia dont have. Either you get the 6 in 1 set (only one Doson scent others one I dunno lol) or get the same bottle again. I really dunno which part of my brain not function well on the day. I bought it wtf.\nYES I BOUGHT THE EXACTLY SAME ONE -..- I think my friend will slap me if they know. I always did this. If I really love the item, I will keep on for us, one just to keep and make sure won't out of stock wtf. I changed last time but now these habit came back to me again. Some more this is not cheap and I'm not sure how I'm going to finish the whole bottle of Doson within one year HAHAHAHAHA!\nI'm sorry but okay la, consider my xmas gift wtf. Then year end got lots of advent calender! OMG I want all!!! But wait, please don't chanwon! So for now, I'm loving the Doson scent. I spray it in the morning and last until 7pm like that. At least 7-8 hours!! The black label version one is stronger than mine and last longer but I think I get the normal one enough. No need too strong lol.\nSo it's my polaroid photo memory wall. I use to look at this a lot and each time my friend who came to my place will pay a visit at this beautiful corner. I love it! It will now a complete heart shape but will grow bigger and bigger. yay!!\nWanted to say a big thank you to Apple and WaiWai who came to my place and fix the new studio backdrop for me. It's no longer a plain white wall but a super colourful one with my birthday unicorn icon design from them too. There are the owner from Party.Nutty and who did a great job to set up for my high tea session with my blogger friends.\nYou may check out their link here: https://www.instagram.com/party.nutty/. One of the service that I always recommended to my friend was the props renting service. If you have budget concern and dont really wish to keep everything that you buy and use it once only for your special celebration then you can think of renting the deco props from them.\nLike a backdrop, those people usually use during birthday, baby's shower event or anything one just RM150 like that only. Like the cupcake holders and decoration items also available for rent. They will teach you how to set up everything according your theme and you could save the amount of money by renting it from their place. Quite worth it and I received lots of dm regarding it, so I guess I could share it here with you if you want.\nFeel free to check out their instagram and contact them. A nice and chio birthday celebration set up is no longer a dream. You can choose all the props based on your budget and they are really helpful too. They help me for kindness and I'm here to share it for kindness. Of course, the owner really sibeh nice and friendly. They are now a mom of two kids but still look so cheerful and young. Plus, my high tea session sibeh chio also must say thank you to them!\nSo this is my Fujifilm XA2 super old model but I used this for years. I guess this year = the 3rd year having it in my life. Most of the time based on my work, I need to be my own photographer. So while I'm shooting for my halloween makeup look, the tripod stand suddenly out of balance and it dropped on the floor.\nMy lens freaking just dropped on the floor and it no longer attached with the camera. I can't turn the camera on so I just freaking pray for it and take the battery out and turn it again & again. So now the camera 'temporary' still working ok but the lens, couldn't attach it back with the camera body<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "5 Things in our Home we Can\u2019t Live Without!\nUsually here on FashionMumblr.com you\u2019ll see beauty, fashion and lifestyle content \u2013 but never a wider look at the surroundings where I spend most of my time. This post, is dedicated to those unsung heroes within our home that make the day to day a little bit easier or more enjoyable and yet they aren\u2019t talked about regularly, or even ever given the spotlight \u2013 until today!\nThe first home favourite, and probably most dramatic change to our living room since we moved in, is our new sofa! For almost 5 years, Charlie and I had an old brown (but very cosy, I must say!) sofa which we\u2019d bought second hand, and it had always been our mission to upgrade it. We had quite a specific thing in mind with what would fit in well in our lounge, and for years we kept our eyes out for something that would meet our needs (big, comfortable, neutral colours, good quality, won\u2019t show up stains / small marks) and be within our budget too.\nTo be honest, neither of us ever really considered DFS. We almost dismissed it as being \u2018too obvious\u2019 and didn\u2019t think there would be one there that would meet our needs, but when we laid eyes upon the Morland 4 Seater Pillow back sofa we knew it would be perfect. We were able to choose from 6 colours to ensure it worked perfectly with the colour scheme in our room, choose from Pillow back fabric sofa or \u2018formal back\u2019, and even personalise right down to the texture of the feet.\nIt was about 6 weeks from the day we ordered right up to delivery, and the home delivery was totally fuss free \u2013 within an hour our living room had been transformed. I listed our old sofa on Gumtree the weekend before our delivery date, and it was snapped up just 5 minutes after we listed it, and taken away that very same day. DFS do offer a collection service of your old sofa, in collaboration with the British Heart Foundation, however they only collect on certain dates, and sadly we were abroad on the date closest to our delivery date!\nColour wise, it works perfectly in our lounge and the size is absolutely perfect too. I\u2019m also incredibly impressed with the quality of the material and finishes, plus \u2013 it\u2019s received the ultimate seal of approval from Dexter, who just loves to sunbathe across the pillows on the back!\nNow this is something that I have spoken about on the blog before, so I\u2019ll make it brief! Charlie and I both love to create a relaxing ambience in the home, both day and night, and to do this we love to fill the living spaces with scented reed diffusers and candles. I\u2019m also not one of those people that likes candles in the home, but never lights them! There\u2019s nothing more relaxing than the soft glow of a candle and that gentle buzzing noise of the flickering flame.\nSome of my favourites include the Next reed diffusers, I\u2019m always very impressed by the value of these \u2013 the scents are on parr with the iconic designer home scents, but the price is far less. We still have the \u2018Winter Collection\u2019 diffuser on our mantle, and it\u2019s barely 1/3 used despite scenting our room for over 6 weeks now.\nOther more luxurious favourites include Jo Malone and Diptyque of course, which really make a statement on any shelf, mantle or table, and also NEOM, whose 3 wick candle is affordable and gives off the most divine scent.\nOur house is not a showroom, so our bookshelves make it a home with all their personal touches. Charlie\u2019s rugby awards and my blogging award are proudly displayed, alongside books that represent both mine and Charlie\u2019s tastes. You\u2019ll find Vogue, Tim Walker and Dior Couture books crammed in alongside books about customer psychology (which I wrote my dissertation on) as well as Charlie\u2019s sportsman autobiographies and factual books. My old school yearbook is in there somewhere too, alongside the butterfly London Fashion Week invitation which I helped to design during my time working at Mulberry.\nPhoto albums, candles, succulents and even our Pet Cam are tucked away on our book case, it truly is a snapshot into our lives!\nA simple new addition to our living room, but one that\u2019s made a real difference. Charlie and I now use our living room as our workspace, creating a mini office on our dining room table, and having the radio on in the background has become an essential element of our workspace. We chose the Goodmans Digital Radio from AO.com, opting for the luxurious Ivory finish and leather strap. It had been a while since I last bought a radio (in fact, the last one was my Roberts Radio which I got for my 18th birthday!) and boy have things changed since then! This new snazzy number is cordless so we can listen in the garden during the summer (but no need for batteries, you plug it into the wall to charge and can just leave it plugged in if you prefer) it also wirelessly plays from your phone and spotify through Bluetooth, has a full screen, clock, alarm and all the usual radio requirements too.\nPlaying our favourite radio station helps to create a relaxing and motivational atmosphere, and the style of our new radio fits so perfectly into the lounge.\nFlowers Complete the Room!\nThroughout this post (I photographed in two stages) there are two incredible bouquets of flowers, both from Bloomon. I like to arrange monthly deliveries of flowers as they truly create such a striking centrepiece in the living room, and I\u2019m always really impressed with the bouquets I receive from Bloomon.\nNot only do they make the room look and feel fresh and bright, but they make for perfect blog photography props too! The vase I received from my first order has come in incredibly handy for the giant floral arrangements too, and if you sign up for your first bouquet via this link, you\u2019ll receive a free vase too!\nSo there\u2019s a little sneak peak into my living room, and a few home favourites!\nWhat pieces in your home are your favourites?<|endoftext|>"

Ideal for scenting small spaces over a period of several months until the fragrance evaporates completely, it can then be refilled one time with the same scent.\nHourglass 2.0 Gingembre is rated 3.0 out of 5 by 2.\nRated 3 out of 5 by Gill68 from Great idea that needs tweaking I love the look of this and the smell, but as another reviewer said, it just doesn\u2019t smell strong enough. Even holding it close only gives a faint smell, which is such a pity as it\u2019s such a great idea. If there was some way to adjust the strength of the fragrance I would give it a far higher mark but unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t do what it\u2019s supposed to.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " For fall I absolutely love Tree House. I visited the Byredo store in Soho for the first time last year and this was burning in their store. Notes include bamboo, pimento, hay, labdanum and leather. It\u2019s so hard for me to describe but it has a good leather + sandalwood mix.\nNew this season is Chai which is the perfect Masala Chai scent. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever burned anything chai scented in my home and this one smells just like the perfect spicy chai tea latte. It does have a very seasonal feel to it, so if you want something more neutral I\u2019d opt for Woods or Tree House.\nFor this season they\u2019ve brought back the minis! You can buy a few of them individually or in a 3-box set with La Selection Violette Mini Candle Trio with Fleur Fantome, Bibliotheque and Burning Rose or La Selection Bois with Bohemia, Cotton Poplin and Tree House. With the minis I was gifted a set and am so excited to burn through them. I\u2019ve bought and used up Bibliotheque and Fleur Fantome before. This was my first time trying Burning Rose.\nLumira is another brand that I\u2019ve had a long love affair with. The Tahitian Coconut is the best coconut and the Persian Rose is the best rose in my humble opinion. The line is based in Australia but their website does offer international shipping. This year they recently launched at Barneys New York in the US and Selfridges in the UK so if you have a store near you I\u2019d recommend checking them out. It\u2019s rare that I like all the scents in a brand but with Lumira, Almira the founder has created exquisite variations in every single candle.\nFor the holiday season she launched Nuit de Noel which smells like Christmas. Notes include black pepper, clove, cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg, aniseed, pear, cumin, rose, lavender, coriander, clary sage, oriental, amber, labdanum, sandalwood, tonka bean, cedarwood, patchouli. I really adore her accessories. She has the prettiest Glass Dome (shown below) along with the best Wick Trimmer I\u2019ve tried (it has an angle which makes it easier to get into smaller jars without tilting the trimmer part) and a Candle Snuffer which I\u2019ve never invested in before but am really happy to own one.\nMany of you love classics from Jo Malone and Le Labo. I\u2019ve burned through a few scents in each line but still keep going back to Diptyque and Byredo. From Jo Malone right now I\u2019m burning Wood Sage and Sea Salt which is a nice option for fall if you don\u2019t want your house to smell like cinnamon, pine or spice. From Le Labo the Santal Candle is my favorite for a strong sandalwood kind of scent, notes include amber, coco, vanilla, cedar, spices, musk and sandalwood. I bought the Violet Grey x Le Labo Santal candle and stocked up when it was in stock. It\u2019s the same as the clear glass version just with black glass.\nSenreve Mini Maestra (c/o) shown above. I still really love it! Full review here. I\u2019m also ecstatic I found peonies at Whole Foods!\nCire Trudon is my most expensive splurge for candles. One of my readers messaged me on a weekly basis for months urging me to buy Ernesto. I finally did and there is no going back. It\u2019s one of the best ones out there. I know scent is so personal but so many of you have told me you also love this. It has a masculine vibe with notes of leather and tobacco. Because it\u2019s so expensive I\u2019ve only burned through a small handful of these (and a few minis). Sometimes they\u2019ll do this one in special packaging so I bought the Rose Gold Ernesto which is a little more pricey but really beautiful. Notes include rum, grapefruit, bergamot, clove, oak wood, patchouli, labdanum, tobacco, moss, leather and amber.\nThe entire line is available at a local store near me and I smell them all every time I visit. Nazareth is the most Christmas-like smelling candle I\u2019ve ever smelled. I really want to buy their Six Candle as well but the steep price tag is pretty hard to justify.\nOther brands that I love that are more affordable and have great gift options include Nest Fragrances and Henri Bendel. The Nest Fragrances Holiday candle is a classic that comes in a wide range of size options. I\u2019ve tried several of the mini ones and the throw is pretty impressive! For the sizes the prices are very reasonable. Henri Bendel makes some really amazing options for the price and the scents are nice \u2013 not overly sweet or saturated. Their Vanilla Bean is one of the best not-too-sweet vanillas I\u2019ve ever burned.\nFor those who cannot burn candles, diffusers and room sprays are nice alternatives. I haven\u2019t tried many diffusers although I have loved the ones from Antica Farmacista. In terms of room sprays Molton Brown makes amazing ones. Andrew is obsessed with the Coco and Sandalwood one. Diptyque also makes some amazing ones, unfortunately if you\u2019re in the US you don\u2019t have easy access to all the scents, but I\u2019m happy they have at least a few. I\u2019ve been drooling over the Byredo ones for months now but haven\u2019t taken the plunge to splurge. Putting it on my Christmas Wish List though!\nFor me, a key accessory for candle care is a wick trimmer. You can definitely use your regular scissors but having one just for candles is nice because the tip is beveled so you can cut the wick straight. It also prevents your scissors from getting burnt remnants on them and the tip catches the cut off end.\nThe Diptyque Wick Trimmer has been one of the best things I\u2019ve ever bought but I think Lumira makes a better one. It\u2019s sleeker and the angle of the wick trimmer makes it easier to trim wicks straight. Also the angle of the handle makes it easier to hold for me. I never felt the need to invest in a candle snuffer but Lumira sent over their Candle Snuffer and I think it\u2019s really nice.\nI hope you enjoyed this holiday candle roundup! With all the options out there I think mini sets are the best way to sample candles, especially if you can\u2019t smell them all in person. It can be overwhelming with all the options out there. I think it\u2019s nice to treat yourself to a small handful at a time. They set the mood for the home in such a nice way.\nI\u2019ve linked the accessories shown in the post in case you want to know the details of the trays, books and lights for your own home decor. What are your favorite holiday candles?\nPress samples include Byredo Mini Trio and all Lumira products shown. Senreve Bag also gifted. All other items purchased by me.\nI\u2019m thrilled to share that the Diptyque City Candles will be available online at Diptyqueparis.com and in Diptyque boutiques for a limited time starting today 9/27 through Sunday 9/30. There are currently 9 city candles that have been created for Beverly Hills, London, Miami, Tokyo, New York City, Shanghai, Berlin, Paris and Hong Kong. Each candle comes in a beautifully designed jar. Since they are only available to the stores in each corresponding city they\u2019re harder to find and track down, but Diptyque is launching them all online for a limited time. Two new launches this round for online include Hong Kong and Paris. There is also a new Boxed Set of Six City Candles that comes packaged together in a white box.\nWhile these are typically only available in city boutiques (similar to the Le Labo city perfumes), there have been a few times where Diptyque has launched the collection online so I was able to buy the ones I didn\u2019t own from boutique trips, but they sell out very fast! Earlier this year I found a wonderful Paris shopper who travels from the US to Paris frequently for work to purchase a couple of the Paris ones for me. Every single one is amazing and beautiful. The boxes these come in are just as beautiful if not prettier than the actual candle jars themselves.\nI have a review for each one today except Berlin. I have the older version which is packaged in a clear glass jar and based on the description I think the tinted design jar is same as the clear one but I haven\u2019t smelled it to confirm.\nQuick note for the US city candles and if you\u2019re based in the US. While the candles are only available at each city boutique (Beverly Hills, Miami, NYC) \u2013 you can call the store to order and they will ship to you! Every store I\u2019ve ordered from and called is very friendly, patient and helpful.\nBeverly Hills was the first city candle I discovered. I reviewed it several years ago when we were still living in San Diego. I am a little embarrassed to admit how many I stocked up on but this was my go-to for a long time. It has lemon, mint, orchid and freesia. It smells like a<|endoftext|>"

They serve as thoughtful, meaningful and unique gifts to bring to friends for any occasion. Great for #selfcare too, these candles will inject just the right amount of mood-lifting scents into your ambience, so you can kick back and truly relax your body and mind!\nHome-made and hand-poured in small batches, the quality soy candles come in pretty glass jars and look almost good enough to eat!\nIn order to cater to different preferences, The Scent Apothecary designs its many candles in two different ranges. Gourmet includes Virgin Pina Colada, Virgin Mojito, Strawberry Shortcake and Peach Pie. While Nature, brings you all the glory of Lavender showers, Lemongrass Zen, Cherry Blossom and Bulgarian Rose. High quality, these soy candles will give you a burn time of between 25-60 hours, depending on the size you purchase. Soy wax also burns slower than other wax, so you'll get a candle that lasts longer. And while most candles emit some fumes, quality soy wax burns cleaner and results in lesser soot!\nA British fragrance that needs no introduction, Jo Malone is known for its elegant, luxurious scents. Unique creations crafted from the most unexpected ingredients, each of its perfumes, home scents, and candles come infused with heritage, wit, and whimsy.\nJo Malone has evolved to become synonymous with coveted scents and luxurious products for bath, body, and home.\nIf you are new to their range of scented candles, you won\u2019t go wrong with the Lime Basil and Mandarin Home Candle.

A modern classic, that is built to uplift, wind down, or simply to add an air of luxury.\nAnother bestseller, the Jo Malone Pomegranate Noir Home Candle carries the sensuality of a daring red dress. Ruby-rich juices of pomegranate, raspberry and plum are mixed with pink pepper, Casablanca lily, and spicy woods.

Multiple boutiques island-wide.\nAll HYSSES candles are hand-poured and made with 100% pure beeswax, non-toxic cotton wicks, and 100% undiluted premium essential oils. Beeswax is not oil-based and is naturally non-toxic. Only cotton wicks are used, translating into cleaner burn fumes than when using conventional wicks containing lead.\nEnvironmentally friendly, biodegradable, safe, and non-toxic, HYSSES candles also release negative ions to purify and improve air quality when burned, making them hypoallergenic. Beeswax has a high melting point which takes up to three times longer to burn than paraffin wax candles.\nDifferent scents include Ginger Lemongrass, Lavender, Rose Geranium and Lemongrass. The candles also come in 3 different sizes - 100g, 200g or 650g - making them the perfect mood uplifting gift too.\nIn these stressful times, we could all use a little emotional encouragement and support. The Innerfyre Affirmation Crystal Candles come with compelling \u201cI am\u201d messages such as \u201cI Am Blessed\u201d and \u201cI Am Loved\u201d. These candles are a blend of essential oils and a sustainably sourced vegan coconut wax. The Innerfyre candles not only smell good but also have real aromatherapeutic effects.\nCoconut Wax is one of the most eco-friendly waxes in the market. It is obtained through a natural process in which coconut meat is gathered and cold-pressed until it creates an oil. Furthermore, coconut wax burns cleaner than other types of candle wax. It emits zero soot particles as the wax is petro-carbon soot-free. No more blackened walls or toxic carcinogens in the air.\nAs the coconut wax burns at a lower temperature than other waxes, it will not cause the essential oils to 'burn off'. It holds 10-12% essential oils, which is much more than the typical 5-8% fragrance load of soy wax. So, the scent is stronger and brings about a positive mood boost. The candles also burn slower and longer for the same volume of wax - a better bang for your buck!\nEnhance your experience by listening to Innerfyre\u2019s curated Spotify playlist of songs.

        "passage": " of scents I tend to be drawn to. Anything too floral and too strong smelling are definite nos.\nRecently a new store opened up in town, a store called Diptyque, a fancy french store that sells fancy scented candles, diffusers, perfume and de toilettes. A small candle costs about $28 while a large candle costs $60. So when I say \"fancy\" I mean \"faaaaancy\". I get my usual diffuser at a beauty store for $20, the diffuser lasts for quite a while, well over 6 months has been my experience- and so while $20 is, for me, quite expensive for keeping my bathroom smelling nice it is still worth the price when considering how long it lasts. So having spent $20 on diffusers in the past I decided to get a small candle ($28) to simply try it out. The selling point that worked on me? Scents such as \"fireplace\" and \"fig\", that's right, a candle that smells like you've got the fireplace going in your home, or the \"fig\" scent that smells like my fig tree in the backyard during fig season. The small candles probably will not last even close to 6 months but maybe the scent will turn me on to regularly spending $28 or $60, I suppose we'll see in not too long if Diptyque candles will make the cut, as for now... Here's to trying something new.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "I really dislike Yankee Candles or any that are synthetically fragranced. I'm pretty sure they are made from paraffin wax as well, which I avoid. I have some nice soy based candles that I sometimes burn when I do yoga. One of my favourites is a geranium candle from a company called Pure Thoughts. I have a lavender aromatherapy candle from a company called Irisu, which is also lovely and relaxing.\nI don\u2019t like Yankee candles. They always smell too overpowering. I have quite a few jo malone, jo loves and diptyque in my home. I love them, they\u2019re great smells, not too overpowering or sweet.\nI like the candles from Rituals but now I buy from a local maker who uses soya wax and natural oils. I normally use a diffuser (cold mist one) with oils so I can make my own scents.\nI've been gifted really expensive candles in the past, and honestly they just sit on the side gathering dust because I'm too scared to burn them just for burnings sake. I feel like i should save them for a special occasion which never comes. I'm happy with the cheap Aldi knock off from Jo Malone. Not scared to burn them just for me.\nI am not bothered about candles at all. I don't like the strong smells, and I always worry too much about the safety aspect of candles to find them relaxing. I don't like getting them as gifts, I usually regift them...\nI love a candle. Woodwick are great as they have the crackley sound. I'd love a Jo Malone but they're are waaaay too expensive. Definitely joint gift territory! I don't really like Yankee. Too sweet and sickly. I like fresh smells. No1 from aldi is nice and not too \"girly\" think its lime and Basil? Jasmine scents are nice. Basically I like nothing too floral or perfumey. Something subtle and fresh.\nI hate Yankee candles, they are far too sickly sweet. I love Neom candles and the diffuser scents, they last for ages and the smell lingers well into the next day due to high essential oil content. Jo Malone doesn\u2019t tend to linger unless you get the intense ones and some of them you just can\u2019t smell at all, but IKEA does a great 3 wick dupe of lime, basil and mandarin. Woodwick are great and good value for how long they last but some of the scents can be really overpowering so definitely trial and error.<|endoftext|>"

She even has a little collection of her own, though her favourite is Yves Rocher's Vanille Bourbon.\nOne point to mention is a difference in how we Europeans use colognes to freshen up. In all French bathrooms you will find a bottle of EDC which is used as a splash to cool down the skin during the day and add a little fragrance. I think there is a tradition of anointing babes in the same way, rather than using baby powder on them.\nFrench people tell me that for them, the scent of orange blossoms is the scent of childhood and babies, whereas Americans say it's Baby Powder.\nI have to confess that in my French bathroom I do have a bottle of eau de cologne and it is not Guerlain's but Bien-\u00catre EDC with verbena and vetiver which I use for all sorts of basic purposes including as a cleaning product, but I would not use it myself on a baby on a regular basis. It's one I am not afraid of letting take in the light it's so cheap. Yes, orange blossom is very much evocative of the scent of a nursery.\nI can very much relate to your scented interaction with your daughter. Although my son does not wear perfume he is very much interested in smells. The other day he was playing with a glass globe he was using to snuff out the Diptyque Roses candle to reproduce the experiment they did at school. I then showed him how it smelled inside the globe where the scent had concentrated. He asked if they made a strawberry scent (this struck me as it reminded me of the post on the strawberry-scented aromatherapy blend used to calm down kids' meltdowns). I then went to fish out precisely one of the Yves Rocher Les Plaisirs Nature I have, the closest one to strawberry, the raspberry one, which he enjoyed.\nIt's a very good line for children to play with and the little bottles are darling for kids.\nHaving said that, children can appreciate more sophisticated scents too as I discovered when my son said about Serge Lutens Serge Noire when it came out and he was 5-6 that it was \"very good\" and smelled like \"caramels in wine\"!!\ni am interested in branded baby perfumes.\nDo you mean, prestige baby perfumes? Guerlain have put out a new Petit Guerlain which is like a version of L'Heure Bleue for babies. Dolce & Gabbana have one too, but I haven't smelled it.

        "passage": "As The Kit\u2018s shopping editor, I see a lot of new items every week. I try on or check out all of them. But every so often, a new fashion or lifestyle product crosses my path that I can\u2019t stop raving about over DMs with my friends or at home with my family. I think it\u2019s only fair to also share my thoughts with you, too. Introducing The Kit\u2018s newest column: my shopping faves of the moment.\nScroll down for the new discoveries on heavy rotation in my life, from Mejuri\u2019s charms to Marni\u2019s red-hot collection for Uniqlo.\nEvery summer, I like to bring back something I religiously wore when I was kid. Three years ago it was the choker, two years ago it was the bucket hat, last year was butterfly clips and this year? Personalized beaded bracelets, which my friends and I used to make for each other. Fun and colourful, they\u2019re sometimes not appropriate to wear to a wedding or a semi-formal event, but now we have Canadian cool-girl jewellery brand Mejuri\u2019s newest collection, Collectibles, which is an elevated take on the charm bracelet. There\u2019s a necklace and paperclip bracelet in 14k gold, which you can personalize with various charms, from letter discs to semi-precious stones. I went for the freshwater pearl, the purpley-blue lace agate bead and the pav\u00e9 diamond lightning bolt.\nWith all things vintage and nostalgic at a high, Roots has revived its beloved collection Beaver Canoe, originally created in 1982 for life on the water in Algonquin Park. The new collection features camp-vibe pieces like an oversized crew neck sweatshirt and matching shorts made from super soft and breathable organic French terry. There are men\u2019s and women\u2019s styles, but everything is really gender-neutral, so you can mix and match to suit your style. Available in the classic Beaver Canoe colours, white and green, there are also pops of neon colour blocking as a nod to the \u201980s. These are the perfect pieces for running errands or roasting marshmallows by the fire pit.\nI\u2019ve been very clear on how I feel about white sneakers\u2014they\u2019re my footwear of choice when it comes to casual (and yes, sometimes semi-formal) wear. So when sustainably minded fashion brand Reformation launched its very first sneakers a few weeks ago, I was curious to know how they hold up against the others.\nThere are two styles: the Harlow, which give off Air Force One vibes and are made from responsibly sourced leather; and the Keds-like Hazel, made of recycled cotton canvas. What sets them apart is that these both styles feature the brand\u2019s signature patterns and colours as accents, so you can match them to your fave Ref sundress or let them be the colour pop for your everyday summer uniform. When you\u2019ve worn them out, these sneakers are recyclable through the RefRecycling program and designed so that the soles will be upcycled into future Ref sneakers while the uppers will go on to other non-fashion uses.\nWhen I first caught wind of Uniqlo\u2019s collaboration with Marni, I immediately texted the news to my friends who all love the quirky Italian designer house as much as I do. I got the chance to head to New York City last month to see it up close, and while I was a little wary about how the house\u2019s signatures\u2014 vibrant colours, playful hand-painted prints\u2014would translate, when I saw it styled on real people at the opening party, I wanted every piece in the collection.\nThe very limited-edition collection consists of relaxed dressy pyjama-like sets, statement skirts, pleated boxy tops and printed floral or check outerwear. At decidedly Uniqlo prices, many of the quintessentially Marni pieces have already sold out since the launch last Thursday, but there are still plenty of styles left including this playful, hand-painted striped dress. Act fast!\nDiptyque\u2019s candles have long been at the forefront of making our houses smell intoxicating, so I\u2019m not at all surprised the Parisian fragrance brand is now extending its offerings beyond candles, diffusers and bath and body products into a truly beautiful household cleaning collection called La Droguerie. It includes dish soaps, leather salves and multi-surface cleaners made with 99 per cent natural and biodegradable ingredients.\nAfter my cousin\u2019s baby blessed my carpet with a little spit-up on the weekend, I wiped it up and used the vinegar-based multi-surface cleaner to scrub the remaining traces. It worked quickly and left the scent of a bouquet of lavender behind, rather than synthetic fragrance or worse, bleach. Even an hour later, the floral scent remained in the room, an unexpected joy. Plus, the apothecary-esque glass bottles are not being relegated to underneath the kitchen or laundry room sinks with my other household products\u2014I\u2019m showing them off in plain sight. I\u2019m also obsessed<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " Suede, Indian Wood, Petit Grain, Pink Pepper and Dust. Each perfume, in its hand-blown bottle by Michael Ruh, is typically appealing and wearable, but our personal favourites are Petit Grain and Dust. The first centres on orange, known as \u2018the pig of perfumery\u2019 because every part of the tree yields fragrant oils, and is a very more-ish cologne. Dust is quieter but quirkier, using iris to conjure up the haze of a summer\u2019s day, over a gentle, resinous base.\nBorn in southern Germany but based in Greenwich Village, Ulrich Lang launched his eponymous fragrance brand in 2003, and has since produced seven perfumes inspired by contemporary photography. His latest, 17 Nandan Road, is named after a park in Shanghai that\u2019s noted for its osmanthus trees, whose orange flowers inspired both the perfume\u2019s scent and the colour of the box it comes in (which also features a photograph by Chinese poet Song Yuan). 17 Nandan Road centres on the plush, peachy-apricot smell of Osmanthus fragrans, but adds citrusy top-notes and extends its depth with wood and leather. Delicious.\nTextile design has always held a special place in Diptyque\u2019s heart, especially since the fragrance house\u2019s history is rooted in fabric and wallpaper design before venturing into scents. This backdrop makes its latest collaboration even more poignant. Working with a selection of designs and patterns from storied French fabrics company Pierre Frey, Diptyque has assembled six coffrets of candles containing a pair of complementary scents. Evoking worlds as far reaching as the inside of an artist\u2019s pouch (leather and violet), an Indian flower market (coriander and jasmine) and Laos (benzoin and oud), each coffret is covered in an equally eclectic pairing of prints to bring each olfactory world to life.\nOn 1 April, Aesop is set to launch its latest magic bottle, the Gentle Facial Cleansing Milk. This non-foaming cleanser is a creamy mixture developed to smoothly remove makeup and any impurities from the skin. The first of its kind from the trusted Australian skincare brand, it\u2019s suitable for all skin types thanks to its (Aesop-typical) gentle nature. Being a water based solution, the formula is created to clean without \u2018drying, stripping or perturbing\u2019 the face, providing clear results, and fresh-looking skin. It contains natural based ingredients such as the oils of sandalwood and lavender stem \u2013 known for their soothing qualities, while grape seed breaks down the oil-based components found in make-up, and Panthenol (Provitamin B5) moisturises. We hope it\u2019s not an April fool.\nIn just over ten years, the fashion designer Jason Wu has played a pivotal role in shaping the landscape of American womenswear. His signature mix of tailoring and unabashed femininity has most recently come to life in the form of a new fragrance, Velvet Rouge, which launched during New York Fashion Week. Bottled in a statuesque flacon designed by the architect Andre Mellone that features a thick smoky glass body topped with a golden circular cap, the fragrance is a seductive blend of crushed violet leaves, pepper, magnolia, rose and incense. Created by perfumer Frank Voelkl, the fragrance succinctly distils the duality of Wu\u2019s design ethos.\nThese versatile powder soaps are a new addition to Acqua di Parma\u2019s Colonia range. The Powder Soaps come in three fragrances; Colonia Pura, Colonia Essenza and Colonia. Upon contact with water, the soap forms into a rich silky lather that lightly cleanses and rinses away easily. It will leave your skin feeling smooth and refreshed, the soap aroma subtly lingering on. Presented in a metal container reminiscent of Acqua\u2019s talcum jars of the past, the soap packaging is available in three versions depending on your favourite scent\u2013 white for the citrusy flavoured Colonia, black for the \u2018sophisticated and vibrant\u2019 Essenza and a silver label for the \u2018modern\u2019 Colonia Pura.\nSkincare brand African Botanics launched in 2013 when ex-South African couple Craig and Julia Noik looked to pay homage to the country\u2019s rich cultural heritage and biodiversity. Since, the eco-pioneer has harnessed the powerful properties of indigenous plants across some of South Africa\u2019s most remote locations, all-the-while meeting important sustainability targets. Its latest innovative iteration, Infusion, is a liquid-light micro-serum boosting hydration and supercharging the skin. Filled with pure and sustainably sourced ingredients, including micro-algae, seaweed and anti-pollution oceanic cell shields, this cocktail of age defying botanicals is the skin\u2019s ultimate antidote to the stresses of modern city living.\nThe story behind Brooklyn-based brand Monder began earlier this year when founders Mitch Moondae and Benjy Baptiste set out to reimagine the relationship between fashion and interior design. Their first collection, ANIMA, features a singular colour palette limited to shades of grey and comprises of five key offerings, including two cushions; a pearl suede and brushed wool blanket; a unisex robe, and an alpaca quilt (pictured), which also doubles as a fine art wall hanging. With a focus on growing responsibly, the duo produces all goods in New York with the help of ethical makers who utilise sustainable materials and techniques. As the fashion and design industries are becoming increasingly fast-paced, Monder provides a more conscious alternative for those who favour longevity over trends.\nThe utilitarian accessory brand MZ Wallace is no stranger to collaboration. For their latest undertaking, the Manhattan-based label has teamed up with fellow New Yorkers tenoverten to create the perfect self-care offering that you can take with you always. The stylish nailcare purveyor has filled one of MZ Wallace\u2019s signature quilted cosmetic pouches with its own line of non-toxic essentials, including its natural rose cuticle oil, its rose polish remover cloths, a cuticle filing stone and bottles of its nail strengthening base and quick dry top coat to boot. The limited edition pouch comes in a custom-designed nude pink shade and also boasts extra room to contain one\u2019s other personal favourites.\nGeneva-based specialists in candles and ambient fragrances Mizensir has collaborated with fellow Genevan writing instrument manufacturer Caran d\u2019Ache, on a new edition of pencils, made from fine woods, and scented with Mizensir founder Alberto Marillas\u2019 M\u00e9moire d\u2019Ecolier fragrance. The woody notes naturally produced by freshly sharpened pencils combines with the sweet candy scent of Marillas\u2019 creation, evoking an atmospheric, back-to-school aroma. The collaboration is an example of Caran d\u2019Ache\u2019s commitment to using noble materials in its pencils; here elicited by the use of ayous and linden woods, which are renowned for their solid yet light qualities.\nBarcelona\u2019s long in the tooth design firm Francesc Rife Studio has leant its hand to a chic new dental clinic in Valencia. Seeking to \u2018balance the seriousness of dentistry with the intimacy of design\u2019, a glass box housing the management, communication and planning offices seems to levitate above the resin floor. Treatment rooms and waiting areas are separated by textured glass, defined by its micro-perforated black coating, offering privacy while giving the interiors a sense of openness and light \u2013 not to mention adding a sheen of glamour to your veneer-fitting.\nThe fashion accessories maverick Anya Hindmarch continues her venture into the world of scent with a trio of new fragrance diffusers. This time employing her whimsical signature stamp with scented ceramic reeds masquerading as coloured pencils, sat within personified pots emblazoned with cheeky cartoon faces (harking back to her \u2018Crisp Packet\u2019 handbag and, more recently, a candle collection designed with Lyn Harris). Hindmarch worked alongside two top-tier perfumers on the new scents: Domitille Michalon-Bertier concocts the herbal \u2018Chewing Gum\u2019, whilst former British Society of Perfumers president Marianne Martin conjures up the nostalgic classroom-inspired \u2018Pencil Shavings\u2019 and fruity \u2018Lollipop\u2019 aromas.\nHair removal is rarely enjoyable business, particularly for the fairer sex, but a new body care label with an eye-catching collection of products is helping women get the job done. Flamingo is the latest brainchild from the men\u2019s shaving brand Harry\u2019s and has applied its experience in razors, blades, handles and aftercare to creating a similarly thoughtful range for women. In addition to function and ergonomics \u2013 Flamingo razors have been specifically designed to hug female curves and come equipped with a lubricated shell for added moisture and rubber grips to prevent slippage \u2013 the Harry\u2019s team has also infused its Flamingo range with added benefits. Shaving gels also moisturise and body moisturises also exfoliate. The collection is rounded out by two at-home waxing kits; one for the face and one for the body. In addition to the soft gel wax strips that don\u2019t require heat, each kit comes with a step-by-step guide, so that they can be applied and used in the<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " place, but he was surely searching for a city of the imagination, a mystical and idealised Utopia where were to be found the virtues and freedoms of ancient Greece. In this respect Mayrhofer was a forerunner of both Walt Whitman ('I dreamed in a dream I saw a city invinvible to the attacks of the rest of the world \u2026 the new city of Friends') and A E Housman, another minor poet potent in the history of song. Housman, a character as bleak and private as Mayrhofer, drew solace from a profound knowledge of classical literature, and the mores of a vanished age. He wrote of 'a Grecian lad, one that many loved in vain', and railed against 'the laws of God, the laws of man'. He also saw 'a country far away / Where I shall never stand / The heart goes where no footstep may / Into the promised land'. As an Imperial censor in Metternich's Vienna, Mayrhofer had to administer part of the police-state machinery which he loathed with all his being. His Heliopolis was a place where these restrictive rules would not apply. He hoped that his Greek-inspired poems would have both a political and emotional message for the reader educated and sympathetic enough to break their code. Schiller, H\u00f6lderlin, and Keats, among many others, are better known than Mayrhofer for their praise of Attic virtues and their elegies for the passing of the classical age. But Mayrhofer's poems are often darker than theirs, with more of a personal axe to grind. The obscurity of much of his work is partly because he is a stylistic forerunner of expressionism, and partly because his poems were aimed at a sacred band of initiates. One of these was undoubtedly Schubert. Whatever the composer's own sexuality, he was endlessly empathetic to the human condition in whatever form he found it, and was able to paint in sun-lit tones his friend's dream city.\nA short while after Schubert's death Mayrhofer wrote a most moving poem (Documentary Biography, p 832) where he envisages Schubert, liberated at last, flying from the cold north to the realms of the sun. In death Mayrhofer makes his composer reach Heliopolis. Whatever their quarrels and disagreements had been in life they were reunited either in heaven or Heliopolis, and are now inseparable in the pages of Lieder history.\nVon einer Stadt, der Sonnenstadt.\nDie mich zu jenen Hallen tragen?\nIm Zwiespalt waren sie verworren.\nWandt\u2019 ich mich nun, und ward entz\u00fcckt.\nRuhe findest du im Licht.\nof a city, the city of the sun.\nthat will take me to its courts?\nfor they were entangled in conflict.\nand was enchanted.\nmake your pilgrimage, and do not doubt.\nIn the light you will find peace.\nSeveral new friends were especially important to Schubert after he made his first bid for independence outside the family home at the end of 1816. One was the gregarious dilettante Franz von Schober, who throughout his long life (he outlived Schubert by fifty-four years!) dabbled at everything and stuck at nothing. Another was the opera star Johann Michael Vogl, who quickly became a fervent champion of Schubert\u2019s songs and did more than anyone to spread his name in Vienna. A third crucial figure at this period was the melancholy, taciturn Johann Mayrhofer, by far the most talented poet in the Schubert circle, whose verses, often on classical themes, inspired no fewer than forty-seven Schubert songs, more than any writer except Goethe.\nFlorian Boesch and Roger Vignoles have chosen five Mayrhofer songs, beginning with the pair drawn from a sequence of poems\u2014probably written expressly for Schubert to set\u2014entitled \u2018Heliopolis\u2019: the ancient Egyptian city of the sun as a symbol of the saturnine Mayrhofer\u2019s longing for an unattainable world of light and peace. Both songs date from April 1822, when, not least thanks to Vogl, Schubert\u2019s reputation was rapidly spreading in and around Vienna. Aus \u2018Heliopolis\u2019 I paints the \u2018cold, harsh north\u2019 in bleak, bardic unisons, then slips magically into the major key as the poet turns to \u2018the flower chosen by Helios\u2019 (\u2018Zur Blume, die sich Helios erkoren\u2019).\nPlusieurs nouveaux amis s\u2019av\u00e9r\u00e8rent primordiaux apr\u00e8s que Schubert eut tent\u00e9 une premi\u00e8re fois de s\u2019affranchir du foyer familial, \u00e0 la fin de 1816. Ainsi Franz von Schober, un sociable dilettante qui, pendant sa longue vie (il surv\u00e9cut cinquante-quatre ans \u00e0 Schubert!), toucha \u00e0 tout et ne recula devant rien, ou encore la vedette d\u2019op\u00e9ra Johann Michael Vogl qui, vite devenu un fervent ap\u00f4tre des lieder schubertiens, fit plus que quiconque pour diffuser le nom de leur auteur \u00e0 Vienne. Un troisi\u00e8me personnage central fut, \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, le m\u00e9lancolique et taciturne Johann Mayrhofer, de loin le plus talentueux po\u00e8te du cercle de Schubert, dont les vers, aux th\u00e9matiques souvent classiques, inspir\u00e8rent au compositeur pas moins de quarante-sept lieder\u2014seul Goethe lui en inspirera davantage.\nFlorian Boesch et Roger Vignoles ont choisi cinq Mayrhofer-Lieder, en commen\u00e7ant par le diptyque tir\u00e9 d\u2019une s\u00e9rie de po\u00e8mes intitul\u00e9s \u00abHeliopolis\u00bb et probablement r\u00e9dig\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019intention de Schubert: l\u2019antique cit\u00e9 \u00e9gyptienne du soleil symbolise l\u2019aspiration saturnienne de Mayrhofer \u00e0 un inaccessible monde de lumi\u00e8re et de paix. Ces deux lieder datent d\u2019avril 1822 quand, surtout gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 Vogl, la r\u00e9putation de Schubert gagna rapidement Vienne et ses environs. Aus \u00abHeliopolis\u00bb I brosse le \u00abnord froid, \u00e2pre\u00bb en d\u2019aust\u00e8res unissons de barde avant de glisser magiquement en majeur au moment o\u00f9 le po\u00e8te se tourne vers \u00abla fleur qu\u2019Helios s\u2019est choisie\u00bb (\u00abZur Blume, die sich Helios erkoren\u00bb).\n Einer war der gesellige Dilettant Franz von Schober, der im Laufe seines langen Lebens (er \u00fcberlebte Schubert um 54 Jahre!) alles ausprobierte und bei nichts blieb. Ein anderer war der Opernstar Johann Michael Vogl, der bald ein treuer Verfechter der Schubert\u2019schen Lieder wurde und der mehr als alle anderen den Namen des Komponisten in Wien verbreitete. Die dritte wichtige Figur in dieser Zeit war der melancholische, schweigsame Johann Mayrhofer, der bei weitem begabteste Dichter in Schuberts Freundeskreis, dessen Gedichte (oft mit Themen des klassischen Altertums) den Komponisten zu nicht weniger 47 Liedern inspirierten\u2014nur von Goethe vertonte Schubert noch mehr Gedichte.\n Beide Lieder stammen aus dem April 1822, als Schuberts Ruf, nicht zuletzt dank Vogl, sich zunehmend in Wien und Umgebung ausbreitete. Aus \u201eHeliopolis\u201c I stellt den \u201ekalten, rauhen Norden\u201c mit einem trostlosen, bardischen Unisono dar und rutscht dann wie auf wundersame Weise nach Dur, wenn der Dichter sich der \u201eBlume, die sich Helios erkoren\u201c zuwendet.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Spring is in the air and our highly developed sense of smell is embracing the various aromas of the most alluring season. The intrinsic connection between scent and brain allow us to evoke emotions, change our mood and awake subconscious memories. Pleasant smells activate certain brain cells which send a positive response through our nervous system. On the other hand, unpleasant ones, cause feelings of stress and anger. Studies show that people living in slums, enveloped by filth and decay, lose their sense of smell and taste due to the overpowering surroundings. How lucky are we? This is the season of fragrance, let\u2019s celebrate with the latest in perfume, scented oils, candles and aromatic skincare.\nNoble VII Cosmos Flower from Clive Christian, L\u2019Ombre dans l\u2019Eau de Parfum from Diptyque and Cashmere Aqua from Donna Karan.\nSince its birth, perfume has become a symbol of power only accessible to the royals and the upper class. The rich concentrated liquid gold was synonym of wealth, class, hierarchy and made those who possessed it highly desirable. It\u2019s believed that perfume played an essential role in politics at courts and lords manipulated meetings by bringing seductive smelling wives, daughters, and courtesans into the halls. To this day, passion and seduction are at the root of perfume, and makers like Clive Christian know it. He designed an empire of fragrances inspired by British royalty and Noble VII Cosmos Flower is one his latest. Infused with bittersweet cocoa, jasmine and plum, this scent is sophistication in a bottle. Another masterful scent directly from the French court is L\u2019Ombre dans I\u2019Eau de Parfum from Diptyque.

Mary Kay\u2019s Spring fragrance Enchanted Wish infuses granny Smith apple, orange oil, stargazer lily, peony, brown sugar, warm amber, and illuminating musk to create this delightful new scent. Vera Wang\u2019s Princess of Hearts is as whimsical as its name and incorporates notes of wild strawberry, creamy musk, watermelon, lily, bergamot and cedarwood.\nThe Ritual of Sakura from Rituals, Herbal Bath Oils from Kneipp and Exquisite Vanilla & Violet Flower Bath Shower Gel and Body Lotion from Molton Brown.\nAs we dive into a more holistic lifestyle, more people are leaving behind chemically infused products and are embracing a more natural approach. Brands are relying on mother nature to enhance their formulas and instead of using scientifically developed scents, they are incorporating the whole plant. The results are wholesome products with active ingredients that have an effect on our skin and emotions. Healing through scent is no longer something exclusive of the very few living an organic lifestyle, but fortunately for all. The Ritual of Sakura from Rituals applies the refreshing and nourishing benefits of Asian rice milk and cherry blossoms on your skin. Kneipp is a mostly vegan German brand that infuses only natural ingredients in their products. Their Herbal Bath Oils were created to calm your nerves, relax your muscles, open your sinus and relieve tension with one bath at a time.

        "passage": "Scented candles are a nice touch to any home. Whether you want to create a romantic mood, calm yourself down after a stressful day at work, or simply want to enjoy a scent that you can\u2019t get enough of, there\u2019s a candle for almost any mood or occasion. Unfortunately, not all candles are created equal, as some have scents that don\u2019t last long while others burn too quickly. We\u2019ve picked 10 brands that make quality creations, and five of them are local brands we\u2019re proud of. Whether you\u2019re looking for candles for yourself or as a gift for a loved one, here\u2019s where you should go.\nThis British brand is one of the most popular names among fragrance lovers, be it in the form of colognes or candles. The range of candles are elegantly simple but create a lasting impression once you light them and inhale the scent. Pick something from their Home Collection and go for their signature fragrance, Lime Basil & Mandarin, if you\u2019re unsure of what to choose.\nOther options include the delicious-sounding Sweet Almond & Macaroon, the berry good Blackberry & Bay, or the oh-so-sensual Pomegranate Noir. For a more plush feel, pick a scent from the Luxury Candles selection, such as Wild Fig & Cassis or Peony & Blush Suede, which will give you up to 220 hours of burn time. And if you can\u2019t live without your calming candles, take them wherever you go, with something from the Travel Candles selection, featuring smaller candles with an 18-hour burn time.\nAvailable at various locations such as Tangs Orchard and Raffles City, check website for details. Visit www.jomalone.com.sg.\nThis French brand is one of the most established names in the market, boasting some of the most gorgeous scented candles you can find. The range is massive, with Classic Scented Candles, Small Scented Candles, Coloured Scented Candles, and Indoor-Outdoor Scented Candles. There are also some scented pillar candles, and you can build your own candle set too.\nGift sets are available too, with such pretty packaging that\u2019ll impress anyone. Bestselling scents include Baies (Berries), Feu De Bois (Wood Fire), and Figuier (Fig Tree). If you love their scents, there are diffusers and room sprays to try as well.\nAt Takashimaya Shopping Centre, 391 Orchard Road, #B1-33a Ngee Ann City, Singapore 238872, tel: 6732 0538. Visit www.diptyqueparis.com/en_us/.\nDon\u2019t judge these candles by their simple hand-blown jars, as the scents are something special. Ashley & Co is a brand from New Zealand that calls its candles \u2018waxed perfume\u2019 and we admit we love this moniker. All candles are individually hand-poured using 100 per cent natural biodegradable wax and an unbleached cotton wick.\nThere are only six scents to choose from at the moment but each of them has a name influenced by a story from each unique scent. For example, Parakeets & Pearls is an old-world scent that brings back the glamour of handwritten love letters and dressing for dinner, while Bubbles & Polkadots is a scent that resembles a baby out of a bath. The candles have a burn time of up to 50 hours and the same scents are available as diffusers too.\nAvailable at various locations such as Gallery & Co, Kapok Flagship Store and Red Dot Museum, check website for details. Visit https://ashleyandco.co/.\nWilliam Penhaligon launched this brand in London in 1870 and his work was so iconic that his recipe books are still consulted by the staff today. Both the packaging and the scents are elegant and all candles are hand-blended from naturally derived soy wax, and packed with essential oils.\nWith names such as Linen Cupboard and The Powder Room (from the Portraits collection) and Lily of the Valley and Samarkand (Classic collection), your room will be filled with some sublime aromas indeed. Being an English brand, the scent of tea plays a big part too, with a tea collection featuring luxury candles in three scents \u2013 Earl Grey, Assam and Neroli (Lady Grey). You could also get a Tea Collection Candle Box, with miniature candles of the three scents.\nAt #03-16 ION Orchard, 2 Orchard Turn, Singapore 238801, tel: 6634 1040 & 01-33/34, The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, 10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956, tel: 6688 7520. Visit www.penhaligons.com.\nEvery product is handmade on a farm in the English countryside of Devon and this British brand strives to support local and ethical suppliers. The 100 per cent natural candles are made with an innovative blend of plant waxes and the glass candle jars are gorgeous so remember to recycle them.\nThere are not many to choose from but this small outfit certainly knows how to let its goods do the talking. Delicate Romance is the brand\u2019s signature fragrance and is a feminine scent that\u2019s a symphony of roses laced with warm spices and citrus, while Sweet Lullaby feels like a \u2018hug in a bottle\u2019, a comforting scent with a blend of lavender and ylang ylang at its heart. They ship internationally so get on their website and place your order now. Visit https://lolasapothecary.com.\nRecognising the fact that we can\u2019t always control the circumstances of our daily lives, To Be Calm wants to help to create an atmosphere that calms our minds and embrace happy thoughts. The local brand hopes its fragrances evoke happy memories in our homes and offices, as well as those of our<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": ", DM seems to have got into posh candles so was thinking of a nice set for Christmas and Jo Malone were the only luxury ones I knew of but was a little at \u20ac60 odd per candle. I'm happy to spend around \u20ac100/\u00a390 but want more than one candle and possibly a hand cream to show for it.\nAny other good brands I should look at?\nAs far as I know jo malone have a set with 3 candles, travel sized. Would that be better?\nPeople who are into luxury candles know their price and would rather have one posh one than a travel set IMO.\nWhat makes these candles better than cheaper ones?\nDiptique are a trillion times better quality than Jo Malone.\nPenhaligons are excellent.\nLike for like quality wise, Jo Malone is on a par with Neom, White Company etc. They're good, and if you want a particular fragrance of theirs, then obviously you want theirs but there are better ones out there.\nThis is interesting. JM are the least \"polluting\"\nI bought this one from Sophie Allport for DDIL. It\u2019s beautiful. There\u2019s 15% off everything atm.\nI really like St Eval candles. Also Porthdune which I think you can only buy online but they smell amazing, even when not lit, in that way Jo Malone ones do.\nOoh that reminds me, there's a Scottish brand we all bought from on the bargains thread last year. Amazing. Skye candles or something.\nLiz Earle puts one out every year and it was without a doubt the nicest mid range candle I've ever had. Rosemary and lavender.\nI got some of these for birthday, smell lovely and crackle like a fire really lovely on these cold dark evenings.\nI wouldn\u2019t buy paraffin wax candles like Diptyque.\nAnother vote for St Eval from me. Their spring flowers fragrance is one of my absolute favourites.\nAround the same price, I also recommend to everyone the Bearded Candlemaker. The candles come in tins so not as luxe looking as others, but the fragrances are amazing.\nJo Malone had a special offer last year in the first week of November, where you get a lucky dip free gift if you spend a certain amount. Last year it was \u00a3100, and I got a free candle, so 3 for the price of 2.\nNeom has a free candle with a \u00a335 spend on Black Friday.\nObviously there\u2019s no guarantees that these offers will be repeated but it might be worth while hanging on another few weeks if you can.\nThese are probably not posh enough for your mum, but my favourites are True Grace and St Eval for nice, but everyday candles.\nAny Jo Malones I have had have been quite smoky, so I don\u2019t rate them much, but I do like Diptyque.\nDiptyque have amazing fragrance but I find they smoke. I really like Jo Loves candles too.\nI agree with St Eval. So much cheaper and potentially better.\nAlso really like essential oil diffusers.\nSt Eval Bay and Rosemary is lovely. Also Tranquility and we currently have Bergamot and Nettle burning.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Candles from Diptyque, Frederic Malle, Byredo, and 12.29 come in attractive glass or porcelain vessels, which are then repurposed to hold fresh flowers and writing utensils,\" says Jennifer Sunwoo, an executive vice president and general merchandise manager of Barneys. Some people even buy empty containers on eBay.\nAlso contributing to this uptick in sales has been the evolution of the industry's scent offering, notes NPD's Karen Grant. Today's most popular scents \u2014 Diptyque's Baies, Nest's Bamboo, Cire Trudon's Balmoral, Voluspa's Baltic Amber, Jo Malone's Lime Basil & Mandarin \u2014 are multi-faceted and complex. This is not a market hinging on simple vanilla votives. Brands are veering towards options that have a more \"esoteric meaning,\" as Cire Trudon's Dang puts it, and customers are taking the bait.\n\"Even if you're spending $80 on a candle, that's still an experience most can afford to bring home.\"\n\"Everything was so floral and mature. I wanted a punchy, modern take,\" Jonathan Adler says. His brand's popular candle scents include hashish, champagne, and tomato; the latter \"reminds me of gardening with my grandfather when I was a kid,\" he explains.\n\"The fragrances today are more gender-neutral, and I believe this is what's driving the market,\" Grant says. \"If everything smelled like flowers and daisies, it wouldn't appeal to everyone. But the combinations out there today \u2014 richer scents with musky and oriental adaptations \u2014 are much more inventive and don't rely on the hyper-masculine or hyper-feminine consumer.\"\nThis especially resonates with younger consumers.\n\"Nowadays, millennials are driving luxury candle sales with their desire for a new and unique experience and their willingness to spend more to buy less,\" Freysinger says. \"They want an experience that is fun, curious, and worthy of talking, blogging, tweeting about. Deliver on that, and they will pay for it and tell their friends.\"\nIn order for these candle brands to continue to thrive though, Freysinger says they must keep making \"a distinctive product that speaks to being artisan, local, imaginative, and spirited,\" as well as figure out what other product categories make sense for them to explore. For their part, Cire Trudon is debuting melted wax diffusers in the spring, and Diptyque is experimenting with vases and other household ceramic objects. Because as popular as Baies is, there's certainly even more money to be made in the world of luxury candles.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "So here I am, back with part 2 of my Christmas Gifts, you can see the wonderful presents my family got me here! As I said before, some people don't like these but my first one has gone down really well. I decided to split my post in two simply because I was overwhelmed by everything I received and one post wouldn't do everything justice!\nAgain, I'll start with makeup and blogger bits purely because they were the main focus of my Christmas list. Firstly, I received the Urban Decay Junkie Vice Palette, we actually picked this up in Sephora whilst at Disneyland because it was sold out everywhere in the UK. Another palette I opened was the Tom Ford Honeymoon Quad which is so beautiful, I've wanted this for so long. Alongside that, my boyfriend also picked out Jared from the Tom Ford Lips & Boys collection. I also ordered myself the Lime Crime lipstick from the beauty bay sale before Christmas but he very kindly bought it for me. There's the standard Snow Fairy purchase which I love and Marc Jacobs Decadence was a complete surprise. I love Marc Jacobs scents and this one I didn't own so i'm glad it's now part of my collection. His mum and dad also picked me up Kiehls' Creamy Eye Cream too!\nMoving on to less beauty focused presents and I received my first ever Diptyque candle in the scent Baies, this smells incredible! Louise Live has been on my wishlist for so long too, I just find her hilarious. I watched this on Boxing Day and it didn't disappoint. I also unwrapped the HP Sprocket which is so lovely. It looks amazing and is so easy to use, there will be a whole blog post about this soon!\nSimilarly to my family presents, I received a fair few books. I actually knew about all of these except for the Jungle themed Dot to Dot which was off my boyfriend's mum and dad. Face by Pixiwoo is brilliant, it also came with a free brush which is brilliant! Scarlett Moffatt is taking over the world so I thought i'd find out a bit more about her by reading her book. Again, Khloe Kardashian is killing it lately and i'm so excited to read about her lifestyle and fitness routines etc. I also got a Youtuber Dot to Dot but I was half way through one when I took the pictures!\nFinally, moving on to bath and homey stuff. I got 2 bath bombs from Lush Northern Lights and Never Mind.I then picked the candle and reed diffuser myself, I picked the Winter Collection from Next as it smells incredible. It honestly smells the same as Jo Malone's Pomegranate Noir, I haven't opened either of them yet and they smell so strong already. I can't wait to start burning them!\nWhat did you receive for Christmas? If you've done a What I Got For Christmas Post then please link it below, I love them!\nThe Tom Ford palette is gorgeous!!!\nSo many incredible presents - especially the tom ford palette!<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "I\u2019m starting to view my life in This is Us style flashbacks. Two years ago, I boarded an early flight to Minneapolis, filling out Drake-themed valentines on board for my friends. I was out of town for the weekend but was enjoying texting with a guy I\u2019d yet to meet. Tonight, I expected to be home watching the Valentine\u2019s Day episode of This is Us (and totally crying, because every week without question it happens) but my boyfriend has other plans. I have no idea where we are going but I suspect it might be the spot where we had dinner together for the first time almost two years ago. Life is crazy and love is wild and I\u2019m getting swept up in the emotion of it all.\nToday is special because we say it is. Not because it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day but also appreciating that this is the time of year our story began. Scent is the most powerful memory trigger so this week, I resurrected a favorite fragrance of mine that happens to be what I was wearing two years ago. I could not get enough of Diptyque Vetyverio \u2013 I wore it nonstop. I am certain I wore it exclusively the first six months of our relationship. I don\u2019t hear enough about this fragrance and that\u2019s actually fine by me. I like being different. You all can have your Santal 33 and Gypsy Water (j/k \u2013 I totally need some Byredo in my life) Vetyverio is the ultimate masculine meets feminine perfume with the earthy, woodsy vetiver and a burst of floral bouquets. I get a wave of rose and when it dries down, there\u2019s a spice to it that clings to my skin. I feel sexy wearing this perfume. And every time I get a whiff, I remember so vividly falling in love. I don\u2019t take that for granted.\nAin\u2019t no party like a 312 Beauty (re)launch party! But not because it doesn\u2019t stop. It\u2019s because we have candles and Social!\nIf you\u2019re local, I hope you\u2019ll come join me at diptyque for a special soiree on November 4. There will be plenty of my new favorite sparkling bev to toast with and treats and raffles from diptyque. It\u2019s always a good night when I can step away from the internet and interact with you in real life! Swing on by and we\u2019ll all collectively swoon over diptyque\u2019s new holiday collection. The fun starts at 5pm. See ya there?\nOne of the most beautiful boutiques in all of Chicago is certainly diptyque in Bucktown. And, ya know, it happens to smell pretty nice in there, too. I stopped in there a few weeks ago to peek at the new 34 Collection, an homage to the original diptyque at 34 Saint Germain in Paris. The vibe was different, in a good way. I was surprised to see colorful and vibrant patterns of cards and notebooks, fragrance diffusers shaped as birds, a marbled clay candle, bronzed candle holders and the most perfect vintage-esque bottle of perfume that looked like it could have been plucked from Catherine Deneuve\u2019s vanity in the 60s. Note on the latter \u2013 in prepping for this collection, they went on a massive treasure hunt to source the bottle and found one of the only master glassmakers in France still working traditionally by hand. The collection \u2018Le Bazar\u2019 is a modern take on diptyque\u2019s market-like beginning. Before I even stepped in the boutique I was welcomed by the scent of the Le Redoute candle, a reincarnation of the potpourri filling the air on opening day at 34 Saint Germain. Like most diptyque candles, it\u2019s a bold aroma that can envelop your entire home immediately. This is a good thing \u2014 I put it to test at my house! It\u2019s a cozy woodsy scent made of cinnamon, clove, orange, rose, cedar and amber. The mat porcelain exterior is special, albeit a departure from the diptyque aesthetic I love so much. Each candle is made by hand using a mixed clay method which makes them all one-of-a-kind. But really, it\u2019s the stories and creativity behind every item in this collection that stands out.\nHow do you apply your perfume? I\u2019ve always been a spray through the air and walk through it kind of girl, which the lovely ladies at Diptyque informed me is the French way. Instantly my haphazard ways are Parisian chic! A few weeks ago, I visited the Bucktown Diptyque boutique\u2014 always a wonderful treat for the senses. I was in search of a new perfume and let my nose lead the way.\nDiptyque approaches the scent selection, be it home or personal, in a very experiential manner. Starts with a chat on your likes and dislikes and continues with a \u201clast man standing\u201d style smell test. No worries if you don\u2019t know your scent profile \u2014 mine is admittedly vague and ADD. They have a way of challenging your instincts and introducing you to notes you didn\u2019t even know you would like. I am all rose all the time, but my favorite candle is Baies (it\u2019s actually the top seller) and I\u2019m wildly attracted to the Vetyverio perfume. OK\u2026yes, both of those have rose, but vetiver in its pure form is a rooty, earthy scent. Turns out, I love it.\nBecause it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day and I adore you all, I\u2019ve got a giveaway courtesy of of the Diptyque Bucktown team!\nIf you\u2019re in Chicago (or plan to travel to Chicago!), Diptyque is inviting one of you to come in and pick out a candle of your choice from the classic collection. Leave me a comment by Sunday 2/23 and I\u2019ll pick at random!\nAlso, I\u2019ve got a mini Rose candle and Eau de Rose sampler set to give to away as well.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " to be PF Candle Co - another soy candle! Our hands down favorite scent from the range is Amber & Moss. PF Candle Co has a variety of scents in many different sizes. I\u2019ve actually seen a lot of people taking mini candles when traveling since it helps bring a place of home with you when you aren\u2019t in your familiar place. I love that the PF candles have a lid so it makes it a bit more friendly to travel with and your items won\u2019t *completely* smell like the candle itself. They specifically have a travel candle with 2.5 oz of product which is a decent size!\nA brand I\u2019ve also had my eye on is Sunday Forever. I\u2019ve seen numerous people talking about their coconut scent - both their fragrances and their candles. I picked one up during Sunday Forever x @DirtyBoysGetClean collab for their Woodcox candle (which is temporarily sold out). The throw on the Woodcox candle is insane and it would honestly make a great unisex gift!\nOne of my standout favorite candle brands right now has to be Overose. From their picturesque pink candles to their swoon-worthy holographic candle jars, you can bet these candles are on the envy list of every beauty influencer out there. Any gal would be over the moon to receive an Overose candle! And don\u2019t even get me started on their scents - they are undeniably beautiful with a scent that throws without even being lit. These candles are made from Rapeseed Wax and they burn quickly and evenly! Tbh I haven\u2019t yet had the guts to burn my holo candle, but I haven\u2019t seen anyone mention any issues with the outer sticker melting at all.\nI already mentioned Diptyque above, but if you aren\u2019t looking to buy the minis you can go full-fledged fancy with a full-sized Diptyque candle. The votives are iconic as re-purposed jars and I\u2019d say Diptyque candles are luxurious \u201calive\u201d or \u201cdead.\u201d Diptyque candles are iconic and people of all ages can enjoy them. Their scent range is quite wide so you\u2019re sure to find something for any of your loved ones. I wouldn\u2019t even say that Diptyque is gender specific - I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty gender neutral.\nAnother gender-neutral luxury candle brand is Byredo. Byredo candles are probably the priciest of them all but 100% worth it for any candle fanatic out there. I bought two almost 2 years ago now but am only halfway through one of them. These candles are extremely potent and the smell on these are so strong that the one I have yet to burn is still emitting it\u2019s scent throughout my room whenever I take it out. When I visited NY in October, I stopped by the Byredo store and sniffed all the candles. It was pretty much a hit with so many of them with the exception of I think two. These candles take 5-ever to burn and pool evenly so know that these ones will last a long time. I\u2019m actually keen on getting some of the mini candles as I think that those will last a hell of a long time. I\u2019m also super excited that Byredo is now carried at Nordstrom! Especially since Neiman Marcus stopped carrying them in-store. Hopefully the Nordstrom near me starts carrying them in-store soon (although that\u2019ll be quite tempting).\nALTERNATIVE SCENT // I know a lot of people actually keep candles around to burn for the scent, but for those that don\u2019t exactly like the burning carcinogens around them (like my family, lol) - there are reed diffusers / wall plug diffusers around. While I\u2019m not a fan of plug-in diffusers anymore, I do still love the reed diffusers. My friend recommended NEST Fragrances Reed Diffuser in Grapefruit which I snagged during the Spring Sephora VIB sale. I saved it until I moved into my new place and I\u2019ve had it cracked open for about 2.5 months now and I\u2019d say there\u2019s still 90% left. I probably should\u2019ve kept the plug for it somewhere so I can cap it when it\u2019s time to move.\nEXTRA // I think there are definitely some great candle tools that would make perfect gifts to those who are candle lovers or alongside a candle. My favorite tool has to be a candle wick trimmer. Whenever T\u2019s friends come over, they all ask what type of torture device this is. A few people have also mentioned how it\u2019s so unnecessary because scissors can do the job. My answer? Yes and no. When you get down bottom to a deep jar, it\u2019s quite hard to get the candle and if you like to do it right after you blow out the candle, you can\u2019t tip the jar at an angle. If you\u2019re investing money into some quality candles, you eat be taking good care of them! I just got a quick pair over on Amazon, but many brands are starting to sell their own. I ended up getting a black one because I didn\u2019t really want to be able to see any black wick remainders lol. Aside from the wick trimmer, there\u2019s also a wick dipper and snuffer. The wick dipper lets you dip a blown out wick that\u2019s smoking into melted wax to stop the endless cloud of smoke. I\u2019m not sure how I feel about this but I can see this working well in theory. The snuffer actually is something that has been on my list and I think I\u2019ll be looking into one to get. I did find a trio on Amazon that is actually quite affordable and comes with all three tools mentioned!\nWhat do you think of candles as a gifted item?\nWhat are your favorite brands / scents when it comes to candles?\nAll products mentioned in this post have been purchased by myself with my own money.\nThis post contains affiliate links.

It embodies the creative freedom and eclecticism that are the hallmarks both of Diptyque and of its original address.\nFormerly only available in extra large size, 34 boulevard Saint- Germain candles now also come in the two iconic smaller formats. On the one hand, the medium size candle, its pot a translucent, opaline white, contains the emblematic oval rendered in toneon- tone. On the other, the large candle, with its engraved white biscuit pot and its three wicks, progressively releases the notes of the signature scent. Meanwhile, the limited edition 34 boulevard Saint-Germain scented oval \u2013 ideal for fragrancing small spaces such as drawers, closets and other enclosed places.\nFor a diffusion method that is both original and poetic, the hour glass in the 34 Collection allows the owner to enjoy the uniqueness of the iconic fragrance in their immediate surroundings for the space of an hour. Meanwhile, the home fragrance diffuser, designed to perfume large spaces on a long-term basis, allows it to unfold over time. Thanks to this beautiful object, designed in a perfect Diptyque oval, it is now entirely possible to savour the 34 experience non-stop in your own home.<|endoftext|>"

As we do every year, we're sharing our gift guides that cover the multitude of people in your life, from luxury fanatics to beauty gurus and trends setters, we'll be launching a new gift guide every week up until Christmas. Think of it as an early Christmas gift.\nToday in order to kick off our gift guides we're sharing the top gifts for the health and wellness lover in your life, because let's face it choosing a gift for them can be tricky. You have to be thoughtful and particular because for the wellness lover, ingredients in products matter. So, without further ado, here is our gift guide for the health and wellness lover in your life.\nTreat your health and wellness lover to a luxurious spa experience in their own home.

With a comforting blend of scents these products have been meticulously crafted to help quiet the mind, relieve tension and cocoon the senses. Not to mention, these timeless and beautifully designed products are perfect to use as everyday decor. Our favorite of the trio? We love the soothing mist before bed, made with essential oils you can spritz on your face or your pillow before bed to have a calming and relaxing effect.\nFor the person who believes in wellness and pampering themselves - this limited edition gift set is one that will leave your wellness lover speechless. Featuring two powerhouse lifestyle brands; Dyson and OUAI it contains 3 OUAI hair products and 1 Dyson blow dryer.

We've talked about essential oils before and broke down their functions as well as the multitude of benefits that come from regular use. From clearing acne to reducing stress to improving your immune system, it's a gift that will keep on giving way after Christmas is over. This specific kit by Saje is a great introduction to the world of essential oils, including 5 products - 4 of which being essential oils you can bring with you on the go or keep at home.\nFor the person in your life who practices self care by pairing a late night read with a nice smelling candle - the DIPTYQUE set is the perfect gift. Made from the iconic luxury Paris perfumer, this collection contains 5 timeless and elegant scents. We love the idea of a mini set instead of a single candle because for many, scents can be a hit and miss. Give the gift of choice this season - with many alluring scents your wellness lover will be calling for a night in more often.\nGive the gift of mindful moments this holiday season with a mediation certificate or class pass at Toronto's very own Hoame. Recently launched this studio is meant for the person in your life trying to get into wellness or whose already well versed.

Today, I\u2019d be sharing with you this reed diffuser and candle that I always light up during Christmas season.\nSince there is no Diptyque store near my area, I always end up with the next best home scent from Rustan\u2019s \u2013 Voluspa. They have a wide selection of home scents and interesting packaging too. For the diffuser, I use the scent Pomegranate Blood Orange from their signature home collection. It sounds bold but surprisingly this one has a very relaxing roomy scent. The glass candle, on the other hand, is a Clove Pomander. Very Christmas-y because of red cloves blended with nutmeg and pear beargamot scent. That is Christmas, for me at least!\nOh, I truly missed writing in my blog like this. Just sharing my everyday discoveries without thinking about sponsorship, deadlines and deliverable. Sometimes I feel like blogging and trad media don\u2019t have differences anymore. It\u2019s now a full-time profession! Within a span of a few months, I\u2019ve been reading complaints about lootbags, payments, event venue, requirements etc. from my blogger friends. Like, are we starting to prioritize advertisers over good stories? Things that we really discover online and not those pr kits that were sent over? Blogging used to be raw. No doubt that this industry is rapidly changing. While I understand that writers are doing it for survival (to pay for bills that we consume to come up with a good articles), I feel like we\u2019re no longer different from stations who get paid advertisements, biased stories and such. I may be just highly sensitive lately but I feel like everything now is a pressure.\nI miss the old times. When you simply write down your thoughts and not even call it a \u201cblog\u201d. Anyway, I wish you guys are embracing the holiday season well. Sorry for the random thoughts. Merry Christmas in advance!\nOo nga noh Ms Carizza, may point ka dyan. There are some din na mukhang paid talaga when they create stories pero still may natutunan din talaga ang readers. Ganun talaga ang life, nag aadapt sa mga changes at least this one no pressure na. Just keep on writing kasi mas nakaka happy naman when you express your thoughts.\nCute btw ng combination, too curious ng Pomegranate Blood Orange.

        "passage": "This one was under the radar until we heard from a couple of other bloggers (thanks Practically Haute and Holy Mundane!) about the Diptyque sample sale at Century 21\u2019s Dey Street location downtown.\nBy Wednesday evening, much of what we saw in other reports were gone. No surprise that the sale was already picked over. But there are still some merchandise left such as random fragrances, Holiday candles and candle sets as well as diffusers.\nThere were no more Standard Candles or minis in the signature scents. As for beauty products, there was only a handful of items.\nPricing is about 50% off retail. In the crowded space, it was not always clear what items cost so I asked one of the helpful staffer to scan my products for the sale price. Check out the various pricelists in the gallery below to get an idea of the markdowns.\nSale ends today at 3pm (June 7th). Although, C21 has been known to extend sales in the past.\nWhere: Century 21, 21 Dey Street (off Church Street).\nI totally thought C21 was out of the sample sale business.\nSo did many of us... but we'll have to keep an eye out!<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "The reality is I am usually lathered in a scent I have created the night before - it is the best way for me to test a creation and decide whether it has a future in the collection. When you make perfume, you also start to understand that the brands charging hundreds for their scents are usually paying ten fold for the box and bottle compared to the oil contained within them. It therefore takes A LOT for me to buy a perfume.\nSites like Fragrantica and Basenotes have their uses - on the whole though, reviewing is an art that not many people are skilled at. Unfortunately the loudest voices have often declared themselves the masters of taste and drown out some of the more helpful reviews. That is right folks, reviews are supposed to be helpful. These sites are however a huge catalogue of what is out there and an amazing place to discover the houses you never knew existed.\nComme des Garcons produce some of my favourite scents. What they do with synthetic notes is marvellous to me and though not everything is necessarily what you would reach for daily, they are bottles of art. \"Zagorsk\" reflects my love of green scents and in my opinion is the best in the Incense series. The pine note is electrifying and the incense here is cold and metallic. I also regularly wear the scent \"Tar\" from the Synthetic collection. It does what it says on the tin. Think warm, hard tennis court and you are about there. Linear and predictable yet beautiful simplicity. A pet peeve of mine is when someone says \"It smells amazing, but not as a perfume - I would like it as a candle or room-spray.\" In the end perfumes fragrance the space around you - whether the vessel to do that is a candle, diffuser or your skin, does not matter at all to me. I frequently use Feu de Bois room spray from Diptyque on my skin and clothes - if they made a perfume I can guarantee the oil content would be less and the price much higher! Yes it does not diffuse as well (room diffusers use a base which evaporates less rapidly) but it is still beautiful and one of my favourite woodsmoke scents.\nTalking of woodsmoke that takes me on to one of the best out there (other than Rook by Rook that is). I tend to buy a new fragrance whenever I visit a new city. Call it an olfactory fridge magnet. On my first trip to the Vatican I found a beautiful perfumery and that is where I bought \"Bois d'Ascese\" by Naomi Goodsir. This throws out a wonderfully rich plume of warm and aromatic smoke. Is it balsamic and ambery and has a wonderful oakmoss in the base.\nLet's move on to a couple of dislikes. My first would be \"Santal\" by Le Labo. An element of this is probably from over exposure. The other is a possible reformulation. After the Lauder take over It seems to have lost its journey and the dill pickle vibe really turned up. The house of Le Labo has some lesser worn but wonderful scents. Their \"Patchouli\" is challenging and complex and on the more gentle end of the scale, their \"Guaiac\" from the city specials series is superb. My next big dislikes are \"Neroli Portofino\" by<|endoftext|>"

All this at a very reasonable price. Any oils can be used with it - our favourites are from Tisserand, robustly scented essential oils at a fair price.\nWho says aromatherapy must be restricted to your home? This travel diffuser is perfect for creating calm atmospheres wherever you go.\nThe Travel Diffuser from This Works comes in a nifty pouch, which includes all you need to set up a piece of peace within your hotel room.\nThe USB power cable can connect to any power device, and unlike others we tested, the diffuser does not require water.\nIt comes with absorbent pads which you add a few drops of the oil to, making it even more hassle free to install. The accompanying Love Sleep Bedroom Blend oil is a 100% natural mix of ylang ylang, patchouli and frankincense, which smells like a warm hug.\nScientifically designed to help de-stress, promote good sleep and even encourage intimacy, this oil ensures your hotel room is a home away from home.\nWhile we love the indulgent aroma of this oil, this compact diffuser can be used with other oils too.\nBoth USB and battery powered, the Aromaworks Aroma Diffuser can be used in the comfort of your own home or on the go for a peaceful atmosphere.\nThe design is an oval shape but is compact enough to fit into any space within your home. Similar to the other travel diffusers we tested, this diffuser works with an absorbent pad rather than water, so takes a little longer to infuse its surroundings.\nIt also features a multi-coloured soft mood lighting which meant it complemented any room or mood we found ourselves in.\nWhile this diffuser does not have multiple time settings, it comes with two essential oils which makes it brilliant value. The petitgrain and lavender oil left us feeling truly relaxed while the lemongrass and bergamot oil invigorated our senses.\nLovers of Diptyque fragrances and candles are rightly devoted to the French perfume house, and will undoubtedly adore this electric plug diffuser, which releases the scent of Diptyque\u2019s signature fragrances gently across the room.\nThis plug-in is pricy, but has great throw, and we found within minutes of deployment our living room was sumptuous with the scent of our favourite Diptyque scent, Baies - delicious rose and blackcurrant.\nThere are no aromatherapy claims to be made here, but if you want your house to smell great, nothing will do the job more thoroughly or quickly. Be warned, though: the diffuser comes without any cartridges, so you have to buy them to go worth it. If you\u2019re serious about room scents, its well worth it.\nStylish, high-performing, and reasonably priced, the Marks and Spencer diffuser is an excellent option for a touch of class in your living room.\nThis silent diffuser provides a fine, steady mist for up to eight hours, and will switch off automatically when it has finished refreshing a room. Much better looking than the price tag would suggest, it lights up via LED in the dark to add warmth to the atmosphere.\nWhile the Marks & Spencer diffuser can be used with any essential oils, this gift set comes with their highly-popular Calm scent, a proprietary mix of cedarwood, bergamot, and lavender, that is especially soothing. We were impressed with this reliable choice.<|endoftext|>"

The only time I have moved slower in my life was when I was 12 and went out of control, downhill in rollerskates. You can guess how that ended.\nThe collection also includes reed diffusers and a coffret of mini candles in all 3 scents. The candles are \u00a33.99 each for the full sized version, and \u00a33.99 for the coffret. In Diptyque money, a full sized candle is \u00a347 and the equivalent set of 3 is \u00a370.\nInevitably, it\u2019s in the scent that the biggest difference is apparent. For starters, the Berries candle smells nothing like Baies and is in fact very figgy. At my local Aldi the Fig candle was almost sold out, so if you miss this then the Berries candle is very similar.\nThe throw of the scent is also far less. You could scent a whole house with a Diptyque candle, whereas with these you\u2019ll just about scent a room. I would say it\u2019s about 40% of the scent of a genuine Diptyque, but then it\u2019s less than 10% of the price so fair enough.\nThey\u2019re very elegant and the set of three little candles in particular would make a good gift. Each comes in a white gift box, and whilst they\u2019re not fooling anybody that they\u2019re the real deal, I can think of worse things to spend \u00a33.99 on. True confession: I ended up making two trips to Aldi and have stocked up for the apocalypse.\nAlso in the Aldi special buys this week you\u2019ll find an Urban Decay Naked Palette dupe. It\u2019s all sealed so you won\u2019t be able to check the colours until after purchase, but from the swatches I\u2019ve seen it looks alright. And there\u2019s a reappearance of Aldi\u2019s dupe for Liz Earle Hot Cloth Cleanser, which really is good and worth stocking up on, apocalypse or not.\nYou can view the Diptyque candle dupes online here Some products are available online, but mostly you will have to go into an Aldi store. I bought mine from Aldi Brighton. They didn\u2019t have masses in stock, and they were hidden under some Royal Wedding towels so if you rummage you might find some.<|endoftext|>"

And they\u2019re having a moment in the home.\nIn kitchens, iridescent tiles work beautifully as backsplashes, wall paneling, or as a surface detailing behind open-shelving units. \u201cIn this type of space, iridescent tiles, like those in our GLOW Collection, create an aesthetic that contrasts with the classic all-white kitchens we often see,\u201d Michael-Battaglia says. \u201cInstead, the tiles take advantage of the larger color scheme at play within the space, reflecting and mimicking what else is in the room.\u201d With that effect in mind, these tiles also work well on fireplaces, where they can pick up the shimmering light of a fire, or on a ceiling where they \u00ad\u00adplay with light and form a creative focal point overhead. They can also add visual interest when used as detail work, bordering, or as an accent feature\u2014particularly in an all-marble kitchen or bathroom\u2014 by breaking up large expanses of the same material with a different texture, Strickler says. \u201cIt creates an element of surprise; since most people use a matte backsplash, using an iridescent tile makes your space stand out,\u201d she explains. For even more of a statement, apply iridescent tiling to an entire wall in the bathroom. As an artistic expression, Livingston prefers to outfit the bottom of a pool with iridescent tiles, create shimmering 3-D-like effects on ceilings, or craft decorative pathways on flooring. She also uses them as logos on the walls to delineate his-and-her bathrooms or as accents just inside the shower to define the soap and shampoo nook. The ideas for creative applications are endless.\nThe iridescent tiles, shown at top and at left, are from Nemo Tile + Stone\u2019s new GLOW collection.\nDazed &amp; Infused not difficult to infuse a spirit. Simply pick your poison\u2014 whiskey, tequila, rum\u2014fill up a bottle or a jug with it, Iandt\u2019svodka, add some stuff. There are no rules.\nSome infused spirits have become a staple that we hardly even recognize them as such, for example, gin (a neutral spirit infused with juniper) and amaro (a neutral spirit or wine infused with herbs). The practice extends across cultures. In China, many restaurants will have jugs full of infused spirits, such as goji berries. And throughout the Caribbean, one finds bars loaded with bottles of rum infused with various sorts of local plants, fruits, and herbs, such as cinnamon or peanuts. Traditionally, infusions were concocted for medical purposes, the alcohol a simple means to extract whatever healing properties a plant was thought to possess as well as a means to preserve it. Today, in mixological circles at least, infusion is done mostly for reasons of flavor and effect. And as drinkers\u2019 tastes and preferences expand, there are more producers offering infused varieties of their spirits, some quite experimental (think bacon-infused bourbon). Here is a collection of some of the more impressive and tasteful infusions on the market today.\nChili pepper is a popular tequila infusion. Tanteo, an award-winning artisanal brand based out of Jalisco, infuses, by hand, various pepper varieties into blanco tequila to winning effect. For another hot sipper with top quality, there is Soltado, a 28-monthold a\u00f1ejo tequila infused with serrano peppers and cinnamon.\nPlantation\u00e2&amp;#x20AC;&amp;#x2122;s Stiggins\u00e2&amp;#x20AC;&amp;#x2122; Fancy rum serves as a perfect base for a pineapple punch.\nBitterman Salt Co. ups the ante on the everyday food seasoning.\nTop right, macro images of salt from Salted, by Mark Bitterman. Below, hand-harvested Icelandic sea salt from Saltverk, a boutique company.\nIf you want to make one single salt upgrade in your pantry, it should be to make sure you always have kosher coarse flake salt at the ready, especially if you\u2019re a pasta aficionado, since it\u2019s just right for salting pasta water as you\u2019re bringing it to a boil, says chef Moosah Reaume, executive chef of the Virgin Hotels Chicago. \u201cBecause it doesn&#39;t have iodine, kosher salt dissolves easily and the texture is perfect for pinching and sprinkling onto anything that just needs an extra hint of salt,\u201d he says.\nFor Kevin Adey, chef and owner of Faro, a Brooklyn restaurant, Maldon sea salt flakes, made in England since 1882, are the ultimate finisher and work wonders to enhance the flavor of grilled meats, especially. \u201cI use these flakes since they\u2019re so full-flavored on my New York strip, venison, and duck breast,\u201d he says.\nAn aerial rendering of the D.C. mall that Bjarke Ingels, shown top right, has plans to renovate.\ncenter and headquarters of the Smithsonian.

In addition to expanding visitor services, Ingels\u2019 master plan includes new Mall-facing entrances to the National Museum of African Art and the National Museum of Asian Art. He also proposes reconfiguring the Hirshhorn Museum\u2019s sculpture garden by adding two double-height contemporary art galleries and a new auditorium beneath it. When his original plan was presented, it drew protests from preservationists. Of particular concern was his proposal to address the aging building\u2019s mechanical systems beneath the Haupt Garden, a 4.2-acre green space in front of the Castle that\u2019s designed to look like a richly landscaped 19th-century garden, by adding a glass roof on the Quadrangle Building under it and building a new subterranean auditorium, gallery, cafe, and shop. Under the revised plan, a new Haupt Garden, which maintains many of the original characteristics, will be moved to the Quadrangle Building\u2019s new roof. According to Linda St. Thomas, chief spokeswoman for the Smithsonian Institution, the first phase of the South Campus master plan, which will include the Castle, will begin in about three years.\nThe Meade LX90-ACF telescope promises the universe with the most advanced ACF Coma-Free Optics to ensure far-off images do not appear distorted for viewers.

That said, a great-smelling home never hurt anyone.\nAhead, we\u2019ve rounded up our favorite diffusers for anyone looking to imbue their living space with the restorative vibes of their choice, whether they\u2019re relaxing or invigorating ones. Read on to figure out which diffuser is right for you.\nThis diffuser is about as straightforward as they come. Ultra-quiet and compact, it can infuse a room with a scent of your choice for up to six hours.\nYou set your coffee maker to switch on when you wake, so why not have an essential oil diffuser that does the same? This Grove Collaborative model can be set for continuous misting over 4 to 5 hours, or for 1-, 2-, or 3-hour intervals.\nAlmost out of sight, but definitely not out of mind. This giftable set comes with one sleek Pura diffuser (which plugs into a wall outlet) and two refill pods of fragrance brand Capri Blue\u2019s Volcano scent.\nIn addition to the mood-boosting effects that accompany any diffuser, the tranquil design of this compact bamboo device seamlessly blends into your room\u2019s decor and adds a touch of elevated simplicity to any room.\nThis no-mist diffuser does double duty as a humidifier, making it a perfect pick for the dry winter months, when your sinuses and skin are constantly craving hydration.\nThis cupholder-friendly, USB-chargeable diffuser was made for long rides in the car, when the air can start to feel a little stale.

With that in mind, this isn\u2019t a great pick if your favorite oils tend to be thicker or more viscous (like vetiver oil), as these can easily clog nebulizing diffusers.\nIs it a diffuser, or a dramatic sculpture?

        "passage": " could use and how to diffuse them properly.\nCan I Diffuse Fragrance Oils And Perfumes?\nYes, you can diffuse fragrance oils and perfumes, but only if they are oil-based.\nFragrance oils are pretty self-explanatory (though we will discuss them in just a bit), but alcohol-based perfumes do not work well in a diffuser.\nAlcohol-based perfumes may smell divine, but they aren\u2019t so great for our skin or diffuser devices. These kinds of fragrances often have harsh chemicals that can harm our skin (such as strip it of moisture) and cause damage to diffusers.\nAlcohol-based fragrances evaporate quickly, therefore requiring the use of strong, synthetic, and often harmful fixatives. Fixatives help stabilize a fragrance and slow down the evaporation rate in some of the more volatile ingredients in one, allowing only a continuous and gradual change in the aroma as it fades away on your skin.\nFixatives also carry notes throughout the stages of evaporation, so you can continue smelling them as you wear your favorite scent.\nThese synthetic fixatives and the alcohol base in a perfume do not make for a great diffuser experience. By nature, alcohol is highly flammable, so it is advised not to put alcohol-based fragrances and perfumes in your diffuser.\nIf you\u2019ve ever tried to buy alcohol-based perfume online and ship it overseas to you, you\u2019ve probably realized that airmail carriers won\u2019t ship perfumes containing alcohol by plane. It\u2019s too flammable, and the same goes for your scents with the same base.\nGo online, and you\u2019ll find different answers on this one, but furniture industry and home decor experts like Kristina from Letti and Co., mostly agree that fragrance oils are safe to use in your diffuser, so long as you water them down.\nIt should be noted, however, that fragrance oils typically contain carrier oils \u2014 such as coconut oil or Jojoba oil \u2014 for topical purposes. They help \u201ccarry\u201d the scent into the skin when applied.\n\nShould you want to extend the life of your diffuser, you should forgo using fragrance oils or perfumes and stick to essential oils. Essential oils do contain carrier oils, but they are used to help dilute the essential oil mixture, unlike for their topical purpose in fragrance oils to help keep the scent in the skin.\nNow before we go any further, maybe you\u2019re new to fragrance diffusing in general. What is diffusing?\nDiffusing is the process of dispersing essential oils so that the aroma from them fills the entire room with its scent. This is often done with a diffusing device, but sometimes wooden sticks are used to disperse the scent.\nMany people opt to go the more natural route and use essential oils in their diffusers, like lemon, peppermint, eucalyptus, tea tree, rosemary, sage, or grapefruit. These oils are naturally anti-microbial and help keep cold and flu germs away when introduced into the air via a puff of mist from a diffuser.\nDon\u2019t be surprised to find calming oils like lavender, chamomile, and clary sage warming up in people\u2019s diffusers in times of stress. These naturally have a soothing effect, which is why so many people gravitate towards flowery scents \u2013 they\u2019ve been proven to help us feel calm.\nOther individuals, on the other hand (you, perhaps, since you\u2019re reading this article?), like to enjoy their favorite wearable scents in a diffuser.\nIf you do this, make sure that you double-check that your fragrance is not an alcohol-based one (it must be oil-based), and remember to add some water when pouring into the diffuser. At the end of this post, I discuss what oil-based fragrances you could use.\nStop longing for your house to smell like Maison Louis Marie No. 4 Bois de Balincourt or Diptyque Philosykos!\nWhen Should I Clean My Diffuser?\nIt\u2019s suggested that you regularly clean your diffuser regardless of what kind of product you use. However, if you use a fragrance oil or perfume, you\u2019ll want to clean it more often to help sustain the lifespan of the diffuser.\nIt is recommended to clean your diffuser every time it runs out of its scent. Regardless of what product you use, regular cleaning is a good practise. It will keep your diffuser running smoothly and it prevents different scents from mixing.\nOnce you\u2019re finished diffusing the fragrance, ensure that you remove all traces of oil or water inside the device. Regular cleanings prevent the accumulation of water, oil, or minerals left behind on the vibrating disk.\nThe vibration from the disk creates the mist or steam that comes out of your diffuser, dispersing the scent. It\u2019s a critical part of your unit, so do take proper care of it by rinsing and drying everything off once done \u2014 or else you may be spending money on a replacement vibrating disk rather than a new fragrance for your machine.\nNow that you\u2019ve used one of your favorite perfumes or your go-to fragrance oil in your diffuser, you need to clean it to ensure your device keeps working correctly.\nYou can easily make a natural solution using vinegar and warm water for a good clean. It only takes a few hours to do, and most of the time is spent with you getting other things done while the solution is soaking and cleaning in your diffuser\u2019s water container.\nMix 60ml of vinegar (\u00bc cup) with some warm water.\nPour the solution into the water container inside the diffuser.\nLet the solution soak inside the water container for 3 hours. Keep the machine off.\nAfter 3 hours, pour the water out.\nUse a cotton swab to gently rub loose and clean off any build-up on the vibratory disk. Be gentle; you don\u2019t have to use much pressure.\nRinse the diffuser and fill it with clean, cold water.\nPlug the unit back in.\nTurn it on to start the misting process.\nWhat Oil-Based Fragrances And Perfumes Can I Use?\nYou\u2019ve learned about which types of scent forms you can use in your diffuser and how to clean it, but now it\u2019s time to talk about what fragrance oils and perfumes would be suitable for diffusing.\nYou can diffuse any oil-based fragrance you like. Most of the typical fragrances you can buy in a store are alcohol-based, but there are different companies that exlcusively sell oil-based fragrances. These usually come in much smaller bottles, as the oil-based perfumes are much more concentrated.\nThere are also a bunch of companies that recreate popular scents into an oil-based version. This is an easy way for you to still diffuse your personal favorite perfume or cologne.\nThe main rule with diffusing is that as long as it isn\u2019t alcohol-based, you\u2019re good to go!<|endoftext|>"

What\u2019s more, any floral waste made in the creation of this product is sold on and upcycled, so it\u2019s kinder to the environment, too.\nThis niche candle brand has been on our radar for some time, and now it\u2019s expanded its range with a new fragrance \u2013 Rhubarb Smoke. Designed to embrace masculine and feminine scents simultaneously, expect to sample unique notes across their vast offering \u2013 from tomato vine to honeysuckle, smoke and rose. We love the impressive burn time, too, as well as how long the fragrance lingers in any room long after the flame has gone out. A great gift for Christmas \u2013 for you, or a loved one.\nScandi designer Anine Bing always gets it right when it comes to fashion, and now, she\u2019s expanding her skillset with a cult new fragrance. Pure Noir delivers all the warmth and sensuality you\u2019d expect. Created to embody the \u2018modern woman\u2019, it balances notes of black rose with nutmeg and black pepper \u2013 sophisticated, feminine and every bit as cool as Anine herself.\nDiffusers don\u2019t come much more stylish than this. Designed to sit on the wall, Diptyque\u2019s new launch is simple and sophisticated, allowing you to scent a large space with their bestselling fragrances. Just slot in one of their clever inserts \u2013 which contain beads saturated with scent. It makes for a beautiful gift, too \u2013 for yourself or a friend.\nBitter Peach may not sound all that synonymous with winter, but the fruity notes are tempered slightly by blood orange and rum-infused oils. Meanwhile, patchouli adds a hint more musk, too. At first spritz, it feels light and citrus-y, but as it dries down, you\u2019ll soon see how it develops into something much cosier. Different to other Tom Ford perfumes, we predict this will be a huge hit.\nCar diffusers just got a whole lot chicer again \u2013 this time, thanks to Jo Malone. The clever design of their car diffuser allows you to attach them to your air vent, and comes filled with one of the brand\u2019s three signature fragrances \u2013 Lime, Basil & Mandarin, Peony & Blush Suede or Wood Sage & Sea Salt. The scent is potent, too, so you get proper bang for your buck, without it being too overpowering. A great gift for anyone this Christmas.\nWhen it comes to self-tanning, our motto is 'the easier the better', which explains why we\u2019re loving Vogue Williams mists. Available in light, medium and dark, the pump makes it easy to ramp up your tan without worrying about overdoing it. Simply spray over your face for a light, gradual glow that builds up over a few hours. Added oatmeal and chamomile means skin gets a hydrating boost, too, while antioxidants combat redness caused by pollution or UV.\nWe found this niche deodorant brand this year via wholesale marketplace site Curate Beauty and have been huge fans ever since. Aluminium-free and antibacterial, each one is made with a crisp, fresh scent that belies any stigma surrounding natural formulas. Unlike others on the market, they don\u2019t wear off quickly and there\u2019s zero powdery residue left behind. We love the chic packaging, too.\nHydrating body oils don\u2019t get much better than this. Luxurious and thick in texture, it glides over the skin with a moisture-rich formula. Cold-pressed hazelnut oil (which is rich in fatty acids) and organic botanical oils keep dryness and irritation at bay, while ensuring limbs stay supple and velvety-soft. Despite its unguent consistency, it sinks in fast, with zero greasy residue left behind. The orange blossom scent adds an uplifting feel, too.\nIt can be hard to get excited about something like a razor, but we love cool brand Estrid. It works as a monthly subscription that starts from \u00a37.95, however, you can choose how often you want new blades, so you\u2019re never forced to overspend. Available in four Instagram-worthy shades, each razor uses aloe vera and vitamin E to nourish and moisturise, while the weighted steel handle has a rubber underside for a steady grip. What\u2019s more, for every razor you buy, Estrid donates a portion to Kvinna till Kvinna \u2013 a Swedish organisation supporting women\u2019s rights in more than 20 conflict-ridden countries.\nPromising effective results without compromising the environment, Biossance is completely recyclable, cruelty-free and uses 100% plant-based ingredients. Our favourite from the range is this does-it-all oil which can be used on the body, the face and even as a soothing shave oil. Formulated with squalane, just a few drops massaged into the skin will encourage speedier cell turnover, boost elasticity and add extra moisture. It\u2019s lightweight too, so it works well when blended with a foundation for a dewy finish.\nCult brand Sol de Janeiro have added to their body care line with this heavy-duty scrub. Brimming with sugar and salt, it feels like rubbing sand onto your skin, but in the most satisfying way. Making light work of dead skin cells, dry patches and red bumps, it quickly lends a softening, silky boost, while cupua\u00e7u butters help to firm skin over time. Plus, the signature summer scent is guaranteed to transport you to the nearest beach.\nWe love this new SPF brand, which has made its way over from California. Aiming to create formulas that are safe for everyone to use \u2013 especially children \u2013 the products are full of vitamin E to strengthen and protect, while the creams, sprays and blocks cover all individual protection needs. This spray is our favourite \u2013 by covering a wide surface area, it offers optimum protection. What\u2019s more, the whole range is reef friendly, meaning they don\u2019t bleach the corals. Plus, the coconut, banana scent is heaven.\nFoaming shower gels are everywhere right now, and this one from Rituals is our favourite of 2020. On first pump, the formula dispenses as a milky oil, but soon foams up into a satisfying lather. Not only is the scent divine, it also works to deeply hydrate and nourish parched limbs with botanical extracts. Use it with your razor for a snag-free shave.\nNew brand, The Solution, dropped at Superdrug this year and it\u2019s seriously good. Affordable and efficacious, we can\u2019t get enough of their Salicylic Acid (SA) Body Gel, which uses salicylic to gently exfoliate and buff away dead, dry patches of skin. Ideal for those suffering with bumps or under-the-skin spots, it quickly softens limbs while absorbing fast with zero sticky residue. Added niacinamide counteracts any harsh effects, too, keeping inflammation to a minimum.\nErgonomically designed, this no-mess body scrub has been designed to fit comfortably in your hand for a gentle, but effective exfoliation. Packed with finely milled biodegradable bamboo powder to buff dead skin cells with ease, it leaves behind a softer surface area immediately. Keep one in the shower and by the bath so you\u2019re never without. We simply can\u2019t get enough of the aesthetically pleasing pink bar and the cult \u2018Glossier\u2019 embossing \u2013 brilliant for those seeking eco-friendly body care alternatives, too.\nWe\u2019ve mentioned our love for fuss-free, efficacious skincare brand CeraVe before, and now, they\u2019re adding a rich foot cream to their cult line. Just like everything else the brand has launched, it\u2019s brimming with nourishing ceramides to keep dryness at bay, while salicylic acid removes bumps and stubborn dry skin without irritation. For best results, use a generous amount before bed, popping on some lightweight socks to lock in the formula overnight. You\u2019ll notice how conditioned and soft they feel in the morning, thanks to a healthy dose of hyaluronic acid.\nCreated for those who prefer a gradual tan, Dove\u2019s Body Mousse works over a few days to build realistic-looking colour that lasts. With a stain-free formula, apply it and sleep in it \u2013 you still won\u2019t see any remnants of dark, orange streaks on your bedding. The best bit is you can completely control the colour: apply a few pumps for just a hint of tan or layer it up over a couple of days for a deeper, vacation-like glow. Ideal for tanning novices.<|endoftext|>"

The exact value of the royal estate is not publicly available, but it was renovated in 2019 for around $ 3.1 million in taxpayer money, which the couple pledged to repay in January when they announced for the their first desire to be financially independent.\nWhen the couple moved from the UK to Canada in November, the couple stayed at the $ 14 million oceanfront Mille Fleurs mansion in Vancouver and stayed there until March. The accommodation was reportedly secured by the husband of Meghan\u2019s best friend, Ben Mulroney, who was able to strike a deal between the royal couple and the landlord for monthly rent that was \u201cwell below market value\u201d.\nMost recently, Prince Harry and Meghan stayed at Tyler Perry\u2019s $ 18 million hilltop mansion in Beverly Hills before moving to Santa Barbara. The couple are said to have stayed in the eight-bedroom house for free.\nWhen the royal couple are not living in luxury accommodation, they tend to travel the world via private jets owned by their famous friends, the biography says. Meghan\u2019s best friend Jessica Mulroney, George and Amal Clooney, and Elton John are said to have provided the two private plane trips from 2016 to 2019, which cost tens of thousands of dollars each.\nHigh-end transportation came under fire last year when the then-active Duke and Duchess launched their green initiative, Travalyst, under their Sussex Royal brand. The organization has encouraged \u201cthe adoption of sustainable practices around the world; and to balance this growth with the needs of the environment and the local population, \u201daccording to a statement on the Travalyst website.\nFox News did not immediately receive a response from the public relations firm that had been hired to represent Travalyst.\nOther notable lifestyle gifts that may or may not have been fully compiled for the couple include the $ 170 Diptyque Berries diffusers that were provided for their wedding ceremony in St George\u2019s Chapel as well as the shower of $ 400,000 baby that was hosted by Clooney and Serna Williams.\nWhen it comes to the Royal Family\u2019s stance on foreigners giving gifts to members, there is a clear policy that was last updated in 2002.\nNelly Korda Wins First Major Title, World Ranking With KPMG Women\u2019s PGA Win \u2013...<|endoftext|>"

Fabulous way to try out the candles as they are just the right size. It\u2019s a brilliant way of trying to find out which scent you would like and maybe you\u2019ll decide to buy the bigger size. Enjoying it thoroughly as I find I am drawn to candles most specially during the winter time. Great idea as a gift, too.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Ciara90 from Great gift I purchased this set of mini candles to give to my Mum in her Christmas stocking and she was delighted with it. The set is a lovely way to sample those classic Diptyque scents and the Christmas packaging is beautiful as always! It's a great gift to give to any candle lover.\nRated 4 out of 5 by Bath lover from Decent set, good for gifting I bought this partly to try Diptyque myself, and party for adding to Christmas gifts for friends. The size is very cute, good for taking a bath or at your desk. The packaging is beautiful. The baies is by far my favourite scent and the throw was good, though not on the first light, only on lighting subsequently. So I\u2019d say a bigger size is actually better value (that works out per weight too). This is a good way to try different scents or gift to multiple people.\nRated 5 out of 5 by 5Cats from A Gorgeous Gift This candle set is an absolutely gorgeous gift ( or self-gift!). Diptyque candles are, in my opinion, the finest scented candles on the market. Having a little assortment of the fragrances in this set is lovely. The festive packaging is very attractive and the price point very reasonable given the quality of the products. I wish Diptyque would make these seasonal packages more often.\nRated 4 out of 5 by Nastasja from Small candles but they do pack a punch I've never bought expensive candles before. The fanciest I bought were White Company diffusers (don't like candles with kids around), but Diptyque doesn't do reed diffusers.I thought I'd buy the trial set of candles during lockdown to see what the hype is about. I'm glad the set included best selling Baies, I've used Baies and Tuberose from this set - small candles that absolutely packed a punch and filled the room with lovely scent. Decent longevity too. I've purchased Tuberose candle for myself as result and Baies for my friend. Figuier did not really work for me - pretty weak and the scent seems generic. Must be something wrong with the batch. Have not tried other candles in the set yet. This set is more pricey per weight than their single 190g candle and only 5 candles with other bestsellers like Mimosa and De Bois missing - not sure it's worth it.<|endoftext|>"

Loewe\u2019s Tomato Leaves, Jo Malone London\u2019s almond-scented Pastel Macaroons and Tom Dixon\u2019s earthy, woodsy Underground diffuser are more offbeat fragrance trails to pursue.\nChoose candles for instant atmosphere, but only, of course, if you are able to keep a watchful eye while they\u2019re burning. After lighting the candle, don\u2019t extinguish it until the top layer of wax has melted or eventually the wick will sink lower, wax will rise around it and you will lose many hours of burn time. Diptyque\u2019s candles are perennial dinner party favourites, especially the classic fig tree fragrance Figuier and sublime Tubereuse. More unusual choices could be Lumos Apothecary\u2019s Cuban Tobacco & Oak, Jo Loves\u2019 Smoked Plum & Leather and Balmoral, offering the scent of \u2018mist, soil and meadows\u2019, from Cire Trudon, the revered centuries-old French candlemakers that supplied the court of Louis XIV.\nReed diffusers provide a constant and subtler scent, but these are more recently rivalled by electronic diffusers that hold aromatic oil and release puffs of fragrance mist into the air at pre-set intervals, rather like the overhead wires above the streets of Grasse. Their sleek, scuptural shapes make them a tabletop asset, too, as in The White Company\u2019s tall white ceramic diffuser, Aromatherapy Associates navy ceramic bowl and This Works Scent Well Portable Diffuser, which is handily powered by USB.\nThere are other ways, though, to introduce touches of fragrance into your home. Jo Malone CBE spritzes her bedlinen with cologne while the white floorboards in her Chelsea home are washed with Pomelo, a fresh grapefruit-infused citrus creation from Jo Loves. The tired image of potpourri has been invigorated with fresh components such as seashells and coconut husks in the Seychelles collection from the White Co, while Agraria\u2019s Bitter Orange potpourri is a chunky mix of cloves, bitter oranges and cypress. This celebrated spicy scent also translates into incense-style Burning Sticks as well as the elegant TasselAire, a long, orange silk tassel to hang on a doorknob or armoire key. If money is no object, however, L\u2019Artisan Parfumeur provides the ultimate home fragrance accessory to display prominently on tabletop or console: a hand-carved amber ball; yours for a mere \u00a31500.<|endoftext|>"

Most use paraffin wax\u2014a chemically bleached petroleum waste product\u2014which means your flame churns out carcinogens when lit. Which then just means a whole different level of stress (if the coronavirus doesn\u2019t kill you, cancer will) and the whole point of this exercise is to lower your stress levels.\nEnter Vancouver-based MIFA and Co., a plant-based, all-natural (free from fillers, toxins, fragrances and synthetics) bath-and-body-care line, with their new soy wax Cardamom Noir candle. Scented with 100% pure essential oils means zero synthetic smells\u2014one whiff of its pure cardamom and you\u2019re instantly transported to the western ghats of southern India.

Vetiver and cedarwood round out the journey.\nIn pre-COVID times, more people used to visit Hawaii in one week than all year in Bora Bora. But with Tosca\u2019s Bora Bora room diffuser, you can book your one-way ticket to paradise all without having to brave public transit over the Pacific.\nThe warm vanilla diffuser evokes the heady scent of French Polynesia with its hints of jasmine, peony, floral bergamot and white tea flower all married with velvety vanilla and sandalwood. Infused with a mandarin aquatic note that\u2019s inspired by turquoise lagoons, the only thing missing now is the overwater bungalow.\nIf you\u2019re suffering from Coronasomnia, you\u2019re not alone. Managing the macro stress (will we all die from this world pandemic?) to the micro (will there be enough toilet paper to go around?) means the ability to hit the hay soundly often takes a hit.\nWith L\u2019Occitane en Provence\u2019s new Cocon de S\u00e9r\u00e9nit\u00e9 Relaxing Pillow Mist, sleep the sleep of angels in southern France\u2019s lavender fields. Mixed with sweet orange and geranium, this 100-percent-natural botanical spray features essential oils that help promote relaxation, well being and fragrant bedtime bliss.\nWith Diptyque\u2019s Dos Son perfumed bird brooch, you can take those basic errand runs and turn them into flights of fancy.\nInspired by Renaissance perfumed jewellery like rings and pomanders (when opportunities to shower were scant, after all), this little pin hides a perfumed disk that discreetly slides in behind. All day long, enjoy the diffused scent of Do Son, a scent imagined by one of Diptyque\u2019s founders. Yves Coueslant spent his childhood summers in Do Son in Along Bay, Vietnam, where a sea breeze carried the spicy nose of tuberose; this fragrance evokes the delicateness and persistence of that childhood memory.\nThe bright lights of the big city have all but dimmed of late with theatres closed everywhere. But if you\u2019ve been binge-watching The Crown recently, you\u2019ve undoubtedly been enjoying a peek behind the dramatic curtain of the royal family. And the Jo Malone English Pear & Freesia Room Spray captures just the right Anglophile note\u2014upper crust without the uppity.\nThe sensuous but mellow freshness of just-ripe King William pears and delicate white freesia dovetail with amber, patchouli and woods for an autumn scent straight from the heart of the English countryside. Close your eyes and take a jolly good walk in an orchard all without having to don wellies or a waistcoat.\nIf you\u2019ve been wearing the same sweat suit for the past week, we wouldn\u2019t fault you. If you\u2019ve been wearing the same underwear, however, it may be time for a talk. Or, rather, time for Effleure\u2019s new scented lingerie.\nCanadian founder Virginia Marcolin brings her role as former lingerie buyer for London\u2019s tony Selfridges department store to the table in her new venture as lingerie designer. These lacy underthings elevate standard-issue sex shop fodder to upscale goods suitable for undergarment drawers everywhere\u2014in lieu of scented drawer sachets, your undergarments become the sachet themselves.\nSubtly perfumed with 100% natural essential oil free of carcinogens and metals\u2014think of it as safe as taking a bubble bath\u2014means your unmentionables become sexy talking points. Or sexy points of departure: black coconut evokes the sun-kissed feeling of a tropical vacation 2020-style.\nSometimes getting away from it all is as simple as hopping in your car. With BC-based Saje\u2019s car diffuser, your staycation becomes a breath of fresh air with the scent of just the right essential oils.\nIn limited-edition holiday packaging, the Road Trip Kit car diffuser clips on your car vent (and works both in hot and cold air) to blow the fragrant Refresh mix of spearmint, lavender, lemon, eucalyptus and cedarwood. Stay sharp and uplifted on those long drives\u2014or just the drive back from the grocery store.<|endoftext|>"
