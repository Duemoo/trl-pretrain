        "passage": "Daesung is a main vocalist in the YG Entertainment Kpop group BIGBANG. Though his parents were initially against him becoming a singer, Daesung pursued his passion and successfully passed his audition at YG Entertainment. He debuted with BIGBANG on August 19, 2006 alongside Taeyang, G-Dragon, T.O.P, and Seungri.\nSoon after his debut with BIGBANG Daesung developed vocal chord nodules, which led him to struggle with his voice and develop stage fright. With the help of then-label mate Gummy, who suffered the same condition, Daesung eventually overcame his condition. Along with various group activities with BIGBANG, Daesung also pursued a solo career, interestingly enough, as a trot singer. He released his first trot single, \"Look at Me, Gwisoon\" in 2008 followed by \"Big Hit\" in 2009.\nIn August 2009, Daesung was injured in a car accident while returning to Seoul from filming a reality show. The accident occurred when the van hit the guard rail and skidded in the pouring rain. Daesung, who was sitting in the passenger seat, suffered a broken nose, a back injury, and sustained minor contusions on his arms and legs. Daesung was fully covered by October 2009, and rejoined BIGBANG for promotions starting then.\nOn May 31, 2011, Daesung was involved in another car accident, this time while at the wheel. The accident occurred while Daesung was driving home at approximately 1:30am one night. An intoxicated motorcyclist crashed his bike on Yanghwa Bridge, and while the car immediately in front of Daesung swerved to avoid the man laying in the street, Daesung did not have time to react and ran over him and hit a parked taxi that had seen him and pulled over. The motorcyclist had a high blood-alcohol content level of 0.18, likely the cause of his crash. For some time time it was unsure as to whether or not he was already dead when Daesung hit him. However, after a long period of deliberation and an extensive autopsy, forensic specialists found that the motorcyclist was indeed alive before Daesung hit him, and that Daesung was responsible for his death. Despite this, the investigation cleared Daesung of all charges, finding that the accident was not his fault as he was not intoxicated, though he was speeding.\nFollowing the accident, Daesung remained underground for 6 months, making no appearances and releasing no new material. He made his first public appearance at the MTV European Music Awards in November 2011, and made a comeback with BIGBANG in March 2012 with their new mini album, Alive.\nDaesung released his first Japanese solo album in February 2013, and has been consistently successful in Japan since. He has released 3 solo albums (two of which peaked at #1 on the Oricon chart) and headlined multiple Japanese tours as a solo artist over the past three years.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "\nJust down the path, find parked boats and jet skis and a little blue building (road view) bobbing on the water. Like Ttukseom Hangang Park, Mangwon hosts water warriors, from windsurfers to yachters.\nPedal further down and spot the\u2026 Okay. Okay. Very funny, guys. Who left their frigate parked on the Han?\nThat 102-meter long, 1900-ton Ulsan Class frigate docked (road view) on the river bank is Seoul Battleship Park\u2019s (\uc11c\uc6b8\ud568 \uacf5\uc6d0) flagship\u2026 flagship.\nFirst opened in 2017, the naval museum includes three decommissioned Korean naval vessels.\nFrigate (Battleship) Seoul (1900-ton, 102-meter) is the museum\u2019s largest. Korea built the vessel in 1985. It served in the ROK\u2019s navy for 30 years.\nMounted on land beside the museum, you\u2019ll find the Patrol Killer Medium, a 37-meter long coast guide ship first deployed in 1978.\nThe last vessel, a 25-meter long, 190-ton dolphin-class submarine, wedges halfway into the glass wall of the museum. Deployed from 1991 to 2016, the sub patrolled and surveilled from behind enemy lines. Inside the museum, curators bisected the sub and exposed its innards to the paying public.\nBut why build a naval museum in Mangwon Park?\nFrom the birth of kingdoms to the Korean War, armies and navies wrestled for control over the Han River. Whomever controlled the waterway ruled the peninsula.\nAnd the Joseon Dynasty\u2019s navy once used this section of river to practice with their warships.\nHow much is a museum ticket? For \u20a93,000, you can tour all the vessels and the museum.\nFinished with your nautical excursions? Mount up and hit the cycling path!\nThe river gleams on your right. On your left, tennis and basketball courts fade into a set of jagged concrete steps (road view).\nHungry? An underpass (road view) offers the best route to Hongdae and Sinchon.\nNot hungry? How about some history? Take the same underpass (road view) near the concrete steps.\nShoved against the expressway and flanked by apartments (road view) in a nondescript neighborhood sits Mangwon Park\u2019s namesake, the 600-year-old Mangwon Pavilion (\ub9dd\uc6d0\uc815\ud130; Mangwon-jeong).\nBuilt for his brother in 1424, King Sejong the Great (\uc870\uc120\uc138\uc885) and other royals would frequent the pavilion, grab a bit of lunch, and watch the naval exercises in the Han River.\nWhile time and war destroyed the Han River\u2019s many pavilions, Seoul restored and designated Mangwon a cultural heritage site in 1989.\nWith bellies and heads topped off, hop back on Mangwon Park\u2019s bike path.\nCut through flora and find Yanghwa Bridge (\uc591\ud654\ub300\uad50; good crossing point). It connects with Seonyu Island Park, an old water treatment plant converted into a sculpture park, and Yanghwa Hangang Park.\nAfter Yanghwa Bridge, Gangbyeon Expressway\u2019s eastbound lanes, hitherto crawling along an inland embankment, rise on concrete pylons and swerve over the Han\u2019s waters.\nGlance up (road view) once the expressway weaves overhead. On your left. It\u2019s \u201cbeheading hill,\u201d or Jeoldu Mountain (\uc808\ub450\uc0b0).\nHere, thousands of Korean Catholics suffered martyrdom in the 1860s. Today Jeoldusan Martyrs\u2019 Shrine stands to commemorate their sacrifice.\nJust northwest of the shrine lies Yanghwajin Foreign Missionary Cemetery (\uc591\ud654\uc9c4\uc678\uad6d\uc778\uc120\uad50\uc0ac).\nEstablished in 1890 to accommodate a growing foreigner community, prominent Protestants, like Korea\u2019s first Methodist and Presbyterian missionaries, reside in the cemetery.\nShelling from the Korean War blew holes in some headstones. Caretakers left the damage as a reminder of the war\u2019s devastation.\nMangwon Hangang Park collapses between the encroaching city and river, but continues on, filling any slice of land with trees, benches, and outdoor gyms.\nBoth east and westbound expressway lanes lift on concrete pylons and flank the bike path, shading park goers from the summer sun.\nSlide down a narrow concrete bridge (road view), then peek under the overpass and across the Han. The red arches of Seogang Bridge (\uc11c\uac15\ub300\uad50; an okay crossing point) hop first to Bamseom Island (\ubc24\uc12c), then to Yeouido on the river\u2019s south bank.\nKeep pedaling. You\u2019ll spot underpasses, one on either side of Seogang Bridge. The first grants (road view) good access to hoppin\u2019 Sinchon Neighborhood.\nThe park regains girth as we enter Mangwon\u2019s end. Bushels of green droop over concrete retaining walls. A jokgu (\uc871\uad6c; hand & foot volley) court sneaks into (road view) the narrow park.\nA few hundred meters down from Seogang Bridge, swirling on and off ramps merge onto Mapo Bridge (\ub9c8\ud3ec\ub300\uad50). On both sides of the bridge, notice layers of sloping ramp (road view).\nBolted onto the side of Mapo Bridge you\u2019ll find the Bamseom Ecological Experience Center (\ubc24\uc12c\uc0dd\ud0dc\uccb4\ud5d8\uad00), one of ten bridge observatories in Seoul. This platform offers the best view of the uninhabited Bamseom Island (\ubc24\uc12c).\nThe last kilometer of Mangwon Hangang Park opens onto green slopes and crosses into the Yongsan District.\nUp ahead, arriving at the heart of old Seoul, the simple V-shaped pylons of Wonhyo Bridge (\uc6d0\ud6a8\ub300\uad50) mark Ichon Hangang Park\u2019s start line.\nYes, those switchback ramps (road view) lead to the Mapo Bridge\u2019s main deck, providing an excellent point to cross the south side of the Han.\nAfter crossing, a ramp on the south side (road view) leads to Yeouido Hangang Park\u2019s bike paths.\nAre you a stamp seeker? Seoul\u2019s north side bike path contains a fatal flaw. It doesn\u2019t stop by every certification center.\nYes. The south side hits two thirds of Seoul\u2019s red booths. But the Ttukseom and Gwangnaru certification centers are interchangeable.\nYeouido Certification Center isn\u2019t. You\u2019ll need to cross. If you\u2019re in a hurry, we recommend crossing at Mapo Bridge. Ride the last half of Yeouido Island, grab Yeouido\u2019s stamp (map), then shoot back to the north side on Hangang Bridge (directions).\nIchon Hangang Park (\uc774\ucd0c\ud55c\uac15\uacf5\uc6d0) spans the middle of Seoul along the north side of the Han River.\nMost of Ichon Park lies in Yongsan, a historic district just outside the ancient Joseon capital\u2019s fortress walls.\nLet\u2019s view a snapshot of the area\u2019s history, then roll some pavement.\nIchon Hangang Park gets its name from Ichon Neighborhood (\uc774\ucd0c\ub3d9; Ichon-dong), where the park\u2019s facilities sit.\nIn the past, the river banks here held a wide sandy beach. Countless generations of Seoulites bathed in the blazing summer sun.\nHowever, 1960s\u2019 boom brought development. Now high-rise real estate and high-income mortals haunt the grounds north of Gangbyeon Expressway.\nLet\u2019s dig a little more into Yongsan\u2019s history.\nModern Seoul sprang from the Joseon Dynasty\u2019s (\ub300\uc870\uc120\uad6d; 1392 ACE ~ 1897 ACE) old capital, called Hanseong (\ud55c\uc131), which translates to: Han (\ud55c; Han River) Fortress (\uc131; seong).\nBugaksan (\ubd81\uc545\uc0b0): north (\ubd81; buk) mountain (\uc0b0; san).\nInwangsan (\uc778\uc655\uc0b0): west mountain.\nNaksan (\ub099\uc0b0): east mountain.\nNamsan (\ub0a8\uc0b0): south (\ub0a8; nam) mountain (\uc0b0; san).\nTo enhance the natural fortifications, engineers threw up walls and gates around the capital.\nInside the walls (\uc0ac\ub300\ubb38\uc548) sat the kingdom\u2019s inner sanctum, including royal palaces and government offices. Outside (\ud55c\uc131\ubd80), commoners, farmers and traders dwelled.\nYong Mountain (\uc6a9\uc0b0; Yong-san), which sits in the middle of the district. Its name means Dragon (\uc6a9; Yong) Mountain (\uc0b0; san).\nA fable from the Baek<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "I enjoy cycling. Not enough to own a bike at home but enough to hire one or join a tour on most of my trips. When planning my trip to South Korea, I decided that I wanted to give cycling in Seoul a try. I thought it would be a great way to get my bearings and explore the city. So as soon as I dropped my bags at the hostel, I headed out for my first adventure. I decided to follow my guidebook\u2019s advice and hire a bike to head on a self-guided tour of Yeouido and the Hangang River area.\nI jumped on the subway and made my way to Yeouido \u2013 a huge island that\u2019s home to Seoul\u2019s main financial district. Some of the city\u2019s (and even South Korea\u2019s) tallest skyscrapers are located on Yeouido but I wasn\u2019t here for the buildings. I headed towards the river and the Yeouido Hangang Park \u2013 a sprawling green space along the banks of the Hangang River.\nI found the small bike rental hut after a few minutes strolling the park\u2019s clean paths. There was a price list in Korean and English and I decided that two hours would be enough for me to complete the 15km route I planned to do. 5000 won (\u00a33.50/$4.70) would get me a \u201csingle\u201d classic bike while splashing out 10000 won (\u00a36.70/$9.40) would land me an \u201cadvanced\u201d bike which I soon figured out was a hybrid bike. I decided I was advanced enough to go for the latter.\nAfter handing over my passport as a deposit (you can use any photo ID), I was handed my shiny bike and I was on my way! It was sunny and warm \u2013 I avoided the worst of the midday heat \u2013 as I set off to explore.\nI cycled west through Hangang Park past strolling couples, friends relaxing in inflatable donuts and kids splashing around in the stream. I stopped to check out a sculpture of a monster from a famous Korean movie \u201cThe Host\u201d that visitors are encouraged to climb. The nearby \u201cI SEOUL U\u201d sign \u2013 the capital\u2019s official slogan \u2013 offered great views of the city skyline across the river. The park seemed like a great place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. UPDATE: The I SEOUL U sign location has changed a number of times since March 2018. Let me know if you spot it somewhere different in the city!\nI headed out of the park and up the ramp onto the busy Mapo Bridge. I cycled across and took the ramp down to the North bank of the Han River. There were a lot more cyclists on this side and a dedicated cycle lane that went along the river. Biking in Seoul appeared to be just as popular as it is in London!\nI was surprised to notice an outdoor gym just a little further. As it turned out, Koreans love to keep active and this became a common sight throughout my visit! I couldn\u2019t resist a mini workout and did a few sets of the bench press! I also got talking to some locals who came up to me and asked me questions about where I am from and what I was doing Korea. I\u2019ve only been in the country a few hours and was already experiencing its incredible hospitality!\nI continued my riverside bike ride, passing a gym every couple of minutes. If I stopped at every single one, I\u2019d be packing some serious muscle by the end of the ride! There were also locals playing something resembling bowls and croquet but I couldn\u2019t really figure out what they were doing! The views on this side of the river weren\u2019t as good, as the path traced a busy carriageway but once in a while I caught a glimpse of Yeouido and its skyscrapers and greenery on the other side.\nAfter a few kilometres I reached a cliff with a building adorned by a cross. This was the Jeoldusan Martyrs Shrine, where in 1866 up to 2000 Korean Catholics were executed and thrown into the Han River. Jeoldusan means \u201cBeheading Hill\u201d in Korean \u2013 I am glad I wasn\u2019t visiting during the night as I can imagine it would be quite creepy.\nIt was time to cross the river back to the south side and after carrying the bike up the steps to Yanghwa Bridge, I cycled past the entrance to Seonyudo Park which occupies an island in the middle of the river. I didn\u2019t have time to explore it but I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s a great place to wander around or enjoy a drink at the caf\u00e9.\nOnce on the other side, I stopped to check another outdoor gym right under the bridge. Among the fitness equipment, pillars supporting the bridge each sported colourful music and film themed murals. I thought it was a really cool way to utilise what would otherwise be a drab space that you wouldn\u2019t give a second glance.\nI rode on down the tree-lined lane and soon made it back to the western tip of Yeouido. There was a fork in the road. Before continuing along the route, I took a detour to check out the Seoul Marina and the National Assembly building (heading down the right path in the photo). Back at the fork, I turned left and headed under the bridge you can see on the left side of the photo.\nThe route heads down the quieter southern part of Yeoudo island along the greenery of Yeouido Saetgang Ecological Park. It\u2019s the first eco park of its kind in Korea and was designed to preserve the ecosystem of the area and educate visitors about flora and fauna in the area. I stopped a few times to wander along the boardwalks that take you closer to nature. I really enjoyed the peace and quiet of the area, even with the towering skyscrapers visible in the background.\nAfter the relaxing stretch through the Eco Park, I reached the eastern end of Yeouido and started heading back towards Hangang Park and the start of my ride. This part of the island is notable for 63 SQUARE, a towering skyscraper and one of Korea\u2019s tallest and most recognised buildings. There is an observatory deck offering impressive views of Seoul, restaurants and even an aquarium!\nI was soon back in Hangang Park, cycling past ice cream stalls and restaurants set just offshore on a pier. Visitors could also hire swan boats to explore the river.\nI managed to cover 15 km in my two allotted hours and still had a few minutes spare when I handed my bike over. I stretched my legs with a stroll through the park, enjoying the late afternoon sun and multiple iced coffees I bought to rehydrate! As first days go in a foreign country, this was a pretty good one!\nIf you liked this post, check out my other blogs on South Korea!\nWhere: Yeouido, Seoul, South Korea.\nGetting There: Subway Line 5 to Yeouinaru, take exit 3 and follow signs to Hangang Cruise Terminal in Yeouido Hangang Park.\nThis entry was posted in South Korea and tagged bike, bike rental, cycling, Han River, riding, seoul, south korea, Yeouido.\nIt\u2019s awesome exploring a new city on a bicycle! Gives you a different perspective of a place.\nThe music and film themed murals are awesome.\nThanks for sharing for this weeks #TheWeeklyPostcard and #FeetdoTravel!\nThanks Vicky \u2013 so colourful aren\u2019t they!?\nSeoul has done some incredible work on transforming spaces to make them more green and people-friendly. There are loads of initiatives like that in the city! Really refreshing to see!\nWe\u2019ve never rented bikes while we travel although I say it would be nice! I don\u2019t know why we don\u2019t! I\u2019ve only done a bike tour is Barcelona and that was hectic! Hills and traffic don\u2019t mix well when you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going! Thanks for linking up with #TheWeeklyPostcard!\nAh I can understand when it\u2019s busy and you are riding in built up areas but this was pretty relaxing and I never felt intimidated by other cyclists and there were no roads to cross! Hopefully you will get a chance to rent a bike someday soon!\nWe walked the parks along the Han River when we were there in May \u2013 but we saw lots of<|endoftext|>"
