        "passage": "I wasn\u2019t shocked when they told me that my student had committed suicide.\nThere had been 11 cases of student suicide in my city \u2013 Daegu \u2013 at that point, and two further attempts. It was also the top cause of death for youth in 2011. Every day, around 40 people kill themselves in South Korea, which has the highest suicide rate amongst the 30 OECD countries and is second in the world according to the most recent WHO research. It was a matter of time before it happened to someone I knew.\nMy 15-year-old student jumped out of her seventh story apartment window. This method of suicide seems to be common, presumably because most middle class Koreans live in apartment buildings. My knowledge of the details surrounding her death was limited: I knew she was worried about her grades, and that she had fallen out with some of her friends. Following the incident, the school put teachers and parents on alert for copycat suicides, a Korean trend that had been particularly prevalent among Daegu students that year.\nSince the suicide of a middle school boy in this city late 2011, the Daegu Metropolitan Office of Education had taken feeble measures to address the issue, including restricting access to school roofs and barring windows. Some of my colleagues told me that teachers were asked to limit open windows to 20 cm wide. Apart from the fact that Daegu summers (which are notoriously sweltering) rendered this a preposterous request, it seemed absurd to treat the symptoms of this social problem rather than address its root causes.\nWhat is Killing Daegu\u2019s Children?\nThe city has long been reputed as the most conservative in Korea, and psychology Professor Choi Seung-Won argues that this leads to a lack of communication between students and teachers, which causes students to feel isolated. However, with the advent of mobile technology and social media, it seemed to me that teachers are more connected to their students than ever before. When I first started working at the school, I was surprised by the close relationship that teachers \u2013 particularly homeroom teachers \u2013 have with their students. When I was a pupil, we didn\u2019t know our teachers\u2019 first names, and definitely not their phone numbers. Many of the teachers in that school seemed to have regular contact with their students online. And, since they spend much more time with the students than parents do, teachers occupy a far greater role in students\u2019 lives in Korea. So, while I agree that a conservative approach to school and government policy is one of the roots of this problem, it doesn\u2019t seem fair to associate conservatism with a lack of communication in this case. Rather, I think that Daegu\u2019s conservatism tends to put strain on the relationship between students \u2013 who live in an increasingly liberal world and have access to information unlike any generation before them \u2013 and their authority figures. In addition, conservative schools are more likely to conform to the status quo \u2013 a social climate that currently gives young people the huge responsibility of driving the country\u2019s rapid development.\nThe pressure to succeed at school (and thus enter a prestigious university and get a job at a prestigious company) originates in the country\u2019s competitive education system and is supported by parents. I wish I had told my student that grades were not the only measure of success, but I doubt it would have made a difference. Considering the hours dedicated to studying at most high schools, it\u2019s no wonder that it was difficult for her to imagine anything outside of her life at school being of any importance. Where I worked, students study for between 13-15 hours a day, and some don\u2019t go home at all \u2013 the school had recently unveiled its new dormitory, which accommodates those who want to cut down on time spent commuting so they can study for longer hours.\nApart from the Korean education system\u2019s overemphasis on grades, Human Rights Monitor South Korea suggests that teaching methodologies are also compound the problem, as they focus on \u201cstrict teaching styles such as memorizing knowledge including cramming education and ranking all the students from top to bottom. Moreover, schools do not teach students creative thinking and how to respect others well.\u201d If students are constantly shown that perfect scores are the only means to succeed, and are all competing for a position in the same universities and companies, they inevitably disregard alternative philosophies.\nA Culture of Suicide?\nIt\u2019s not just high school students that are feeling the desperation for escape from contemporary Korean society. In 2011, four students at the Korean National University of Arts committed suicide in the space of five months. In the same year at Daejeon\u2019s KAIST, four students and a professor took their own lives. In Seoul, six residents of an apartment block killed themselves in a three-month period in early 2012.\nWith South Korea\u2019s economic boom and rapid development in social welfare, it seems odd that contemporary Koreans are more likely to take their own lives than their ancestors \u2013 who survived war and great poverty. I struggled to understand how a country like South Africa \u2013 my home \u2013 has a lower suicide rate amidst a host of social problems and an economy that puts most people below the breadline. After some research on global wellbeing, I discovered that some of the world\u2019s happiest nations are developing countries. Social and cultural pressure seems to affect the human psyche in ways far different than poverty. As \u201cThe Korean\u201d of Ask a Korean says, it is precisely this rapid development that breeds an environment conducive to suicidal impulses. His astute analysis of suicide amongst middle-aged men, celebrities and socio-political leaders explains this phenomenon in detail. However, while The Korean argues that there is nothing specifically cultural about suicide in Korea, I would say that the national obsession with education and massive emphasis on social image \u2013 both of which are fundamental to contemporary Korean culture \u2013 are large contributors.\nDaegu\u2019s suicides have alerted Korean society to the problems that an education system geared towards preparing students\u2019 for one university entrance exam \u2013 the CSAT \u2013 has caused. Parents have called for the resignation of Woo Tong-Ki, superintendent of the Daegu Metropolitan Office of Education, and \u201cfor changes in the competition driven system centered on university admissions\u201d, saying that \u201cchanges must be made to the current college admission system, [in which] students fiercely compete for admission to elite universities\u201d.\nAs a cog in the machine that drives this system, I have often observed that students are well-aware of its flaws. This has caused a mistrust and resentment for those in authority, and I can see why. I have spoken to many individual parents and teachers that disagree with the education system, and yet take steps to support it \u2013 none of them feel able to take an individual stand. Parents continue to send their children to hagwons in fear that they may deprive their children of the tools to compete in contemporary Korea if they don\u2019t. Teachers and principals continue to use methods they don\u2019t support, as they feel unable to challenge the status quo.\nThe students cannot rely on their guardians to ensure their wellbeing, and they know it. For now, students are resorting to suicide as a means to take control of their lives. When they reach adulthood, I suspect that their mistrust of the previous generation will be a foundation for some dramatic changes in the education system \u2013 and Korean culture at large.\n\u2190 A Multicultural Korea: Inevitable or Impossible?\nNice article bringing attention to this important issue at the ground level.\nHowever, Korea\u2019s social welfare is also one of the worst in<|endoftext|>"

We will send our a WebEx meeting link to the registrants before the meeting to test your connection ahead of time.\nWebEx Meetinng Recording: Play recording Meeting actually starts at 6:30 into the recording.\nWireless power transfer (WPT) is one of the most promising technologies in recent years, which is expected to provide ultimate convenience and safety of electronic systems and to create huge market in mobile devices, electric vehicles, biomedical implants, and IoT sensor network applications in the near future. However, as the power of the WPT system increases and the distance from Tx to Rx increases, the interference to other electronic system and the electromagnetic field effect on the human body becomes a serious problem. The electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) issues of WPT systems are very critical in the commercialization of the wireless power devices. In this lecture, the EMC aspects of magnetic resonant and microwave WPT systems are discussed in terms of electromagnetic field generation and solutions in different applications. Although the research on the various EMC solutions for general electronic systems has been done for decades, most of EMC techniques for the reduction of unwanted electromagnetic fields are not applicable due to physical limitation of the WPT system. Instead, recent advances in electromagnetic field reduction methods for WPT systems such as magnetic field shaping, active/passive/reactive shielding, field cancelling, and harmonic filtering techniques for a magnetic resonant WPT system are investigated. In addition, retro-directive and time reversal techniques for microwave power transmission are developed, as well as traditional electromagnetic interference reduction methods. This lecture also covers the trend of standardization of WPT technology as the EMC problem of the WPT system is the key issue in industry. The future direction of EMC standard issues of a WPT system such as on frequency allocation, field regulation, and standard measurement of electromagnetic field from a WPT system is explained.\nSeungyoung Ahn received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 1998, 2000, and 2005, respectively.

        "passage": "Despite political tensions, research ties are resilient.\nJapanese and South Korean scientists conduct collaborative research aboard the Korean icebreaker ARAON.\nOn 31 March 2020, just before South Korea imposed a mandatory two-week self-quarantine for all incoming travellers amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Shik Shin, at the University of Tokyo, managed to ship one of his six laser photoelectron spectroscopes to the country.\nThe spectroscope is installed at a new laboratory at Seoul National University (SNU), jointly set up in 2019 between his university\u2019s Institute of Solid State Physics (ISSP) and the Center for Correlated Electrons Systems (CCES) of the Institute for Basic Science of Korea. Shin says the lab was established thanks mainly to his 20-year friendship with Se-Jung Oh, president of SNU, and other Korean collaborators at the CCES.\nSince Shin pioneered ultra-high resolution laser photoelectron spectroscopy in 2005, Japanese researchers have been using the equipment to uncover novel magnetic and superconducting properties of various materials that could lead to the development of new electronic devices.\nHe wanted to introduce the equipment to South Korea \u201cbecause I felt something exciting will happen by combining both countries\u2019 scientific strengths\u201d, says Shin, who was elevated by the president of the University of Tokyo to the special title of \u2018university professor\u2019 in physics on his retirement in 2019.\nThe ISSP and CCES, along with collaborators from Taiwan\u2019s National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center, have held annual seminars in one of their three locations since 2000.\nShin\u2019s efforts are illustrative of the way collaborations between South Korean scientists and their Japanese colleagues have developed, based on personal relationships, rather than as a result of a government-led initiative.\nThe two countries have the sixth most productive collaborative partnership in the Asia-Pacific region in the Nature Index. Compared with other regional partnerships, it is stagnant, with the quantity of their shared output relatively unchanged since 2015. Both Japan and South Korea have much faster-growing, more productive collaborative partnerships with their mutual neighbour, China.\nDiplomatic relations between South Korea and Japan have deteriorated over the past few years, especially since 2018, when South Korean courts ruled in favour of compensation for Japan\u2019s use of forced labour in 1910 to 1945, when the Korean peninsula was a Japanese colony. In 2019, Japan imposed new trade restrictions on South Korea, and South Korea responded with controls on exports to Japan.\nThere are no current government-led large scientific frameworks to promote bilateral collaboration. Science and technology ministers of South Korea, Japan and China met for the first time in seven years in 2019, but they only agreed to tackle issues of common concern, such as climate change, through existing mechanisms.\nA trade dispute between the two countries occurred in 2019, when the Japanese government tightened controls on exports of three semiconductor materials (fluorinated polyimide, photoresists and hydrogen fluoride) to South Korea.\nThat move hit South Korea\u2019s high-tech industry hard because its chip manufacturers relied on imports from Japan. It prompted South Korea to strengthen its R&D practices to boost self-reliance, especially in research on new materials and parts, says So Young Kim, director of the Korea Policy Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, a research group at KAIST in Daejeon.\nTakahiko Sasaki, a materials scientist who also oversees research ethics at Tohoku University, says the Japanese government\u2019s action has little impact on academic research. His university\u2019s relationships with South Korea have been unaffected by political manoeuvring, he says.\nAccording to the latest Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development figures, Japan spent 3.28% of GDP on science and technology in 2018, compared with 4.53% in South Korea. Both countries plan to drive their economies through the pandemic with innovation.\nFor 2021, Japan\u2019s main budget on science and technology research edged up 0.8% from 2020 to \u00a51.35 trillion (US$12.8 billion). Last July South Korea announced its \u2018New Deal\u2019 plan to spend 160 trillion won (US$133 billion) by 2025 on a green and digital economic transformation, boosting spending on science and technology beyond the allocation that is set to double the National Research Foundation of Korea\u2019s (NRF) budget for basic research to 2.5 trillion won in the five years to 2022.\nThe relatively modest international collaboration frameworks already in place work well, says Hiroshi Nagano, a visiting researcher specializing in international scientific policies at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo.\nFor example, since 2005, the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) and the NRF, along with the National Natural Science Foundation of China, have been operating the A3 Foresight Program to support two trilateral projects every year. Projects under way include empowering eastern Asian elders to use the Internet of Things, and the application of atomic-scale organic and inorganic materials.\nThe JSPS and the NRF manage small-scale funding schemes to support collaborations. \u201cGovernment-led frameworks do not always lead to good papers,\u201d Nagano says. He says promoting individual-based activities is less sensitive to politics and leads to productive research.\nThey felt that combining their interests \u2014 Koh in vascular biology and Suda in haematopoietic stem cells (blood-cell formation from stem cells) \u2014 could pave the way for finding new molecular mechanisms of angiopoietins and their receptors, which are linked to the process of blood-cell production and vascular stabilization. They then started to visit each other\u2019s labs about once a year, eventually publishing eight joint papers.\nThe first one, published in 2004, has been cited more than 2,000 times (F. Arai et al. Cell 118, 149\u2013161; 2004).\nNow that Koh is the director of the Center for Vascular Research at the IBS/KAIST in Daejeon, and Suda is the director of the International Research Center for Medical Sciences at Kumamoto University in Kyushu, Japan, the two scientists can see that their friendship and cooperation is inspiring further collaborations among the next generation of researchers.\nFor example, Pilhan Kim at KAIST, a specialist in cellular resolution imaging of vital organs, is developing techniques to enable young investigators at Kumamoto to clearly observe their chick-based model and mouse model for human tumour growth, as well as to investigate how cells multiply and move through the body.\nMeanwhile, geneticist Young Seok Ju at KAIST visited Kumamoto University in 2018 and saw a naked mole-rat being actively studied with conventional cellular and biochemical techniques. Ju recognized that by applying his high-throughput genomic technologies, which allow for the sequencing of multiple DNA molecules in parallel, they could work together to find molecular mechanisms underlying the species\u2019 well-known but little understood longevity.\n\u201cProfessor Koh showed me how international collaborations should work. Knowing each other is the baseline for strong collaborations,\u201d Kim says.\n\u201cThe strong tie between KAIST and Kumamoto can be a seed for us to further expand this kind of global collaboration,\u201d Ju adds.\nFusion research is one of the most active fields for bilateral collaborations. The National Institute for Fusion Science (NIFS) in Gifu, Japan, and the Korea Institute of Fusion Energy in Daejeon call for new proposals every year for jointly operated collaborative programmes that have run since 2005.\nKatsumi Ida, coordinator of the Japan\u2013Korea bilateral programme at the NIFS, says the fact that researchers in both countries don\u2019t tend to change jobs between research institutions has been an advantage in establishing a long-term relationship. Another benefit is the comparative ease of exporting research equipment to South Korea. Such exports to China, by contrast, are subject to strict controls.\nTerritorial issues often cause headaches for marine scientists, however. For example, the shallow channel between Japan and South Korea is called the Tsushima Strait by Japan and the Korea Strait by South Korea.\nLast year, Naoki Hirose, a researcher in marine current monitoring at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan, wanted to use \u2018the Tsushima/Korea Strait\u2019 in the title of a paper written with South Korean collaborators.\nIt\u2019s less fraught in the Antarctic Ocean, where Jinyoung Jung, an oceanographer at the Korea Polar Research Institute in Incheon, South Korea, is working with Japanese scientists to understand the impact of global climate change on polar oceans. He collected sea-water samples and sent them to Shigeru Aoki, one of his collaborators at Hokkaido University in Japan, who measured stable oxygen isotopes to estimate glacial meltwater fractions. Their first joint paper is under review.\nIn it, they suggest fluorescent dissolved organic matter is a useful tracer to identify glacial meltwater and circumpolar deep water, a mixture of the world\u2019s oceans, which causes glacial melting in the Amundsen Sea in western Antarctica, where other widely used chemical tracers such as stable oxygen isotopes are absent.\nMeanwhile, Japanese researchers are often aboard South Korea\u2019s advanced icebreaking research vessel ARAON, conducting collaborative research in the Arctic Ocean. \u201cCombined use of our expertise and capacities brings mutual benefits, which we would not have otherwise,\u201d Jung says.\nKoji Shimada, a climate oceanographer at the Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology and a pioneer of Japan\u2019s Arctic research, favours grassroots collaborations between individual researchers over international consortia driven from the top down.<|endoftext|>"

After completing the AI course, graduates will be hired by KT.\nKT has been making aggressive advancements in non-telecom businesses, vowing earlier this year to double its non-telecom revenues by 2025.\nAccording to KT, companies that do not adapt to the digital era will fail to survive radical industrial change. The company will offer its technologies to local companies for a smooth transition into the future, KT President Park Jong-ook said Tuesday at a tech conference in central Seoul.\n\u201cDigital transformation is essential for a company to strengthen its industrial competitiveness but it\u2019s also a challenge that could end some for good,\u201d Park said.\nPark emphasized that AI, big data and cloud networks will be keys to a digital transformation that, if not implemented properly, will lead to a company\u2019s extinction. KT\u2019s digital transformation agenda is, therefore, not just for the company itself but for the good of Korea and Korean companies, according to Park.\nThe conference, called \u201cDigital Transformation & AI Ecosystem for Future Industries,\u201d was co-organized by KT and the Korea Information Society Development Institute (Kisdi) and featured tech experts from Korea and abroad.\nCompanies that are pushing their own digital transformations shared their experiences, including Siemens Digital Industry Software Korea and Canadian tech company Scale AI, as well as companies from overseas such as Germany\u2019s Fraunhofer IGD and France\u2019s GE Healthcare.\nThe essence of digital transformation lies in the subversion of the work hierarchy, meaning that what used to be considered the means becomes the end, according to Huh Suk-zoon, senior vice president of the KT Institute of Economics & Business Research.\nKT has chosen 14 fields of industry to develop its ABC technology including finance and national defense, and will be providing expertise to the government and local companies. To make sure that companies take the path, the government needs to loosen regulations and encourage companies to change themselves, Huh said.\n\"Local companies are aware that digital transformation is necessary, but only 30 percent are making actual efforts,\" he said. \"The government needs to encourage companies to move toward a transition through different promotional policies. And in that process, KT hopes to be the company that helps make Korea the digital leader in the world.\"<|endoftext|>"

John Kim received his Ph.D. from Stanford University and B.S/M.Eng from Cornell University. His research interests include computer architecture, interconnection networks, security, and mobile systems. Prior to graduate school, he worked on the design of several microprocessors at Intel and at Motorola.\nCurrent and future many-core processors in HPCs demand highly efficient on-chip networks to connect hundreds or even thousands of processing cores. While router-based networks-on-chip (NoCs) offer excellent scalability, they also incur significant power and area overhead due to complex router structures. In this talk, we present a new class of on-chip networks, referred to as Routerless NoCs, where costly routers are eliminated. An example design is proposed that utilizes on-chip wiring resources smartly to achieve comparable hop count and scalability as router-based NoCs. To explore the large design space of routerless NoCs more effectively, we further develop a novel deep reinforcement learning framework that learns the optimal loop selection for routerless NoCs with various design constraints. Compared with a conventional mesh, the proposed design is able to achieve 9.5X reduction in power, 7.2X reduction in area, 2.5X reduction in zero-load packet latency, and 1.7X increase in throughput. These results demonstrate the viability and promising benefits of the routerless paradigm, and call for future works that continue to improve the performance, reliability and security of routerless NoCs.\nLizhong Chen is currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Oregon State University.

Epub 2021 Mar 26.\nQuantum wells (QWs), enabling effective exciton confinement and strong light-matter interaction, form an essential building block for quantum optoelectronics. For two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, however, constructing the QWs is still challenging because suitable materials and fabrication techniques are lacking for bandgap engineering and indirect bandgap transitions occur at the multilayer. Here, we demonstrate an unexplored approach to fabricate atomic-layer-confined multiple QWs (MQWs) via monolithic bandgap engineering of transition metal dichalcogenides and van der Waals stacking. The WO/WSe hetero-bilayer formed by monolithic oxidation of the WSe bilayer exhibited the type I band alignment, facilitating as a building block for MQWs. A superlinear enhancement of photoluminescence with increasing the number of QWs was achieved. Furthermore, quantum-confined radiative recombination in MQWs was verified by a large exciton binding energy of 193 meV and a short exciton lifetime of 170 ps. This work paves the way toward monolithic integration of band-engineered heterostructures for 2D quantum optoelectronics.\nEpitaxial Single-Crystal Growth of Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Monolayers via the Atomic Sawtooth Au Surface.\nAdv Mater 2021 Apr 10;33(15):e2006601. Epub 2021 Mar 10.\nCenter for Integrated Nanostructure Physics (CINAP), Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, 16419, Republic of Korea.\nGrowth of 2D van der Waals layered single-crystal (SC) films is highly desired not only to manifest the intrinsic physical and chemical properties of materials, but also to enable the development of unprecedented devices for industrial applications. While wafer-scale SC hexagonal boron nitride film has been successfully grown, an ideal growth platform for diatomic transition metal dichalcogenide (TMdC) films has not been established to date. Here, the SC growth of TMdC monolayers on a centimeter scale via the atomic sawtooth gold surface as a universal growth template is reported. The atomic tooth-gullet surface is constructed by the one-step solidification of liquid gold, evidenced by transmission electron microscopy. The anisotropic adsorption energy of the TMdC cluster, confirmed by density-functional calculations, prevails at the periodic atomic-step edge to yield unidirectional epitaxial growth of triangular TMdC grains, eventually forming the SC film, regardless of the Miller indices. Growth using the atomic sawtooth gold surface as a universal growth template is demonstrated for several TMdC monolayer films, including WS, WSe, MoS, the MoSe /WSe heterostructure, and W Mo S alloys. This strategy provides a general avenue for the SC growth of diatomic van der Waals heterostructures on a wafer scale, to further facilitate the applications of TMdCs in post-silicon technology.\nA Flash-Induced Robust Cu Electrode on Glass Substrates and Its Application for Thin-Film \u03bcLEDs.\nAdv Mater 2021 Apr 26;33(13):e2007186. Epub 2021 Feb 26.\nDepartment of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), 291 Daehak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea.\nA robust Cu conductor on a glass substrate for thin-film \u03bcLEDs using the flash-induced chemical/physical interlocking between Cu and glass is reported. During millisecond light irradiation, CuO nanoparticles (NPs) on the display substrate are transformed into a conductive Cu film by reduction and sintering. At the same time, intensive heating at the boundary of CuO NPs and glass chemically induces the formation of an ultrathin Cu O interlayer within the Cu/glass interface for strong adhesion. Cu nanointerlocking occurs by transient glass softening and interface fluctuation to increase the contact area. Owing to these flash-induced interfacial interactions, the flash-activated Cu electrode exhibits an adhesion energy of 10 J m, which is five times higher than that of vacuum-deposited Cu. An AlGaInP thin-film vertical \u03bcLED (VLED) forms an electrical interconnection with the flash-induced Cu electrode via an ACF bonding process, resulting in a high optical power density of 41 mW mm. The Cu conductor enables reliable VLED operation regardless of harsh thermal stress and moisture infiltration under a high-temperature storage test, temperature humidity test, and thermal shock test. 50 \u00d7 50 VLED arrays transferred onto the flash-induced robust Cu electrode show high illumination yield and uniform distribution of forward voltage, peak wavelength, and device temperature.\nSynthesis of metallic mixed 3R and 2H NbS nanoflakes by chemical vapor deposition.\nFaraday Discuss 2021 Apr 1;227:332-340. Epub 2021 Feb 1.\nInstitute of Microengineering and Nanoelectronics, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 43600 UKM, Bangi, Malaysia.\nIn this work, we report the synthesis and characterization of mixed phase NbS nanoflakes prepared by chemical vapor deposition. The as-grown samples show a high density of flakes (thickness \u223c50 nm) that form a continuous film. Raman and X-ray diffraction data show that the samples consist of both 2H and 3R phases, with the 2H phase containing a high concentration of Nb interstitials. These Nb interstitials sit in between the NbS layers to form NbS. Cross-sectional Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy analysis with transmission electron microscopy suggests that the 2H NbS region is found in thinner flakes, while 3R NbS is observed in thicker regions of the films. The evolution of the phase from 2H NbS to 3R NbS may be attributed to the change of the growth environment from Nb-rich at the start of the growth to sulfur-rich at the latter stage. It was also found that the incorporation of Nb interstitials is highly dependent on the temperature of the NbCl precursor and the position of the substrate in the furnace. Samples grown at high NbCl temperature and with substrate located closer to the NbCl source show higher incorporation of Nb interstitials. Electrical measurements show linear I-V characteristics, indicating the metallic nature of the NbS film with relatively low resistivity of 4.1 \u00d7 10\u03a9 cm.\nEnhanced Photoluminescence of Multiple Two-Dimensional van der Waals Heterostructures Fabricated by Layer-by-Layer Oxidation of MoS.\nACS Appl Mater Interfaces 2021 Jan 23;13(1):1245-1252. Epub 2020 Dec 23.\nDepartment of Materials Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Korea.\nMonolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising for optoelectronics because of their high optical quantum yield and strong light-matter interaction. In particular, the van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures consisting of monolayer TMDs sandwiched by large gap hexagonal boron nitride have shown great potential for novel optoelectronic devices. However, a complicated stacking process limits scalability and practical applications. Furthermore, even though lots of efforts, such as fabrication of vdW heterointerfaces, modification of the surface, and structural phase transition, have been devoted to preserve or modulate the properties of TMDs, high environmental sensitivity and damage-prone characteristics of TMDs make it difficult to achieve a controllable technique for surface/interface engineering. Here, we demonstrate a novel way to fabricate multiple two-dimensional (2D) vdW heterostructures consisting of alternately stacked MoS and MoO with enhanced photoluminescence (PL). We directly oxidized multilayer MoS to a MoO/1 L-MoS heterostructure with atomic layer precision through a customized oxygen plasma system. The monolayer MoS covered by MoO showed an enhanced PL intensity 3.2 and 6.5 times higher in average than the as-exfoliated 1 L- and 2 L-MoS because of preserved crystallinity and compensated dedoping by MoO. By using layer-by-layer oxidation and transfer processes, we fabricated the heterostructures of MoO/MoS/MoO/MoS, where the MoS monolayers are separated by MoO. The heterostructures showed the multiplied PL intensity as the number of embedded MoS layers increases because of suppression of the nonradiative trion formation and interlayer decoupling between stacked MoS layers. Our work shows a novel way toward the fabrication of 2D material-based multiple vdW heterostructures and our layer-by-layer oxidation process is beneficial for the fabrication of high performance 2D optoelectronic devices.\nProbing One-Dimensional Oxygen Vacancy Channels Driven by Cation-Anion Double Ordering in Perovskites.\nNano Lett 2020 Nov 28;20(11):8353-8359.

Margolis, 1 C. Tom A. Brown, 2 Patrick Gill, 1 and Giuseppe Marra 1* Abstract: We demonstrate an amplitude-to-phase (AM-PM) conversion coefficient for a balanced optical-microwave phase detector (BOM-PD) of rad, corresponding to AM-PM induced phase noise 60 db below the single-sideband relative intensity noise of the laser. This enables us to generate 8 GHz microwave signals from a commercial Er-fibre comb with a single-sideband residual phase noise of 131 dbc Hz 1 at 1 Hz offset frequency and 148 dbc Hz 1 at 1 khz offset frequency.

However, until now it has not been shown that the BOM-PD can suppress AM-PM conversion efficiently. Jung and Kim measured for their BOM-PDs to be between 0.06 rad and 0.3 rad depending on the offset frequency [11], values which are very similar to those for photodiodes and which correspond to an AM-PM induced phase noise between 11 db to 24 db below the single-sideband RIN of the laser. In this work we report a modified BOM-PD design that results in a significantly improved AM-PM conversion coefficient of rad. 2. Balanced optical-microwave phase detector and residual phase noise measurement A schematic of the BOM-PD setup is shown in Fig. 1. The BOM-PD synchronizes an 8 GHz dielectric-resonator oscillator (DRO) to the 80 th harmonic of the 100 MHz repetition rate of an Er-fibre comb. After the erbium-doped fibre amplifier the optical power is approximately 40 mw and spans a bandwidth of about 30 nm centred at 1545 nm. The DRO signal is applied to a unidirectional travelling-wave high-speed phase modulator within a Sagnac interferometer. The phase error e between this signal and the pulse train in the optical domain is detected by converting it into an intensity imbalance between the two output ports of the Sagnac interferometer. The powers P 1 and P 2 at the two output ports are given by P P 2 cos ( / 2) and P P 2 sin ( / 2) where P avg is the average output power of the 1 avg 2 avg Sagnac interferometer and is the phase difference between the counter-propagating beams. To lock the DRO frequency to the repetition rate of the optical pulse train requires the intensity at the two outputs to be balanced. This is achieved by introducing a non-reciprocal phase shift of /2 between the two counter-propagating beams using two Faraday rotators and a quarter waveplate. P 1 and P 2 are detected using a balanced photodetector and the difference between the two photocurrents is fed into a transimpedance amplifier to yield an error signal proportional to e. Fig. 1. Schematic of BOM-PD. EDFA: erbium-doped fibre amplifier; FR: Faraday rotator; QWP: quarter waveplate; DRO: dielectric-resonator oscillator; VOA: variable optical attenuator. All fibres after the polarizer are polarization maintaining. The inset shows the phase error e between the microwave signal and the pulse train in the optical domain.\n4 In order to achieve high AM-PM suppression we have made two key changes to the BOM-PD setup described by Jung and Kim [10]. Firstly, we have introduced variable optical attenuators (VOAs) at each output of the Sagnac interferometer. These compensate for the loss in the optical circulator and ensure that the balanced intensity condition is met, which is crucial for effective suppression of AM-PM conversion. Secondly, we add a DC voltage to the error signal to compensate for unwanted offsets in the loop filter electronics. Since only fairly coarse adjustments could be made using our VOAs, this DC voltage is also used to fine tune the balanced condition. In order to measure the residual phase noise of the extracted microwave signal we built two nominally identical BOM-PDs. BOM-PD1 is locked to the 80 th harmonic of the comb repetition rate while BOM-PD2 is used as an ultra-sensitive phase detector fed with the 8 GHz signal from the locked system as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Phase noise measurement set-up. EDFA: erbium-doped fibre amplifier; AOM: acoustooptic modulator; PD: photodiode; DRO: dielectric-resonator oscillator, BOM-PD: balanced optical-microwave phase detector. Also shown is the setup used to generate and measure amplitude noise for the experiments described in section 3. In Fig. 3 we plot the single-sideband (SSB) phase noise versus the offset frequency in the range 1 Hz to 100 khz. From the data shown, it can be seen that residual phase noise levels of 131 dbc Hz 1 at 1<|endoftext|>"

This should come as little surprise, such is the length of time it will take to bring the technology to fruition. According to the Korea Herald, Samsung has begun it\u2019s 6G mission as part of the wider Samsung Research business unit.\nWhat 6G actually is remains to be seen, but such are the rewards in leading each generation of mobile technology, it would appear it is never too early to cast an eye on the horizon.\nUnfortunately for Samsung, it is not the first to the party. In January, LG Electronics and KAIST announced a joint 6G Research Centre in Daejeon. LG has said it wants to use the research centre to pre-emptively secure technology for 6G.\nWork has already started for 6G standards. In March, a small group of scientists gathered in Levi, Finland, to host one of the first global summits on the 6G Wireless standard. This was not the most of complex of meetings, though it was aiming to start work on the most important questions; why does the world need 6G?\nThe answer is relatively simple for the moment; we don\u2019t know.\nThe technological and business case for 6G will emerge eventually as 5G gains more traction around the world. As with 5G in the 4G era, forward-thinking engineers predicted the demand for increased speed, more efficient spectrum use and efficiencies to drive profitability. 5G does of course offer more, but you only need a framework to build on to start with.\nThis is what the initial 6G forays will be based upon, but it is important to understand what the short-comings of 5G are. The problem needs to be understood before a solution can be crafted, otherwise, what\u2019s the point?<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Abstract: The physiological studies about visual cortex from the investigation of cat\u2019s striate cortex by Hubel and Wiesel have confirmed the consensus of foundation knowledge about biological intelligence in the nature. We proposed the new way of implementing the neuromorphic VLSI and processing for mimicking the robust biological intelligence of visual detection, inspired by the ideas on the visual cortex and the implementation of neurophysiological neuron model by Hodgkin and Huxley formalism. The neuromorphic synaptic connections and neurons were investigated for implementation of the visual signal selectivity of cortex, based on the controlled CMOS conductance. The feasibility of neuromorphic device and system approximating biological intelligence was demonstrated by the robust detection of human objects or vehicles. The neuromorphic simple cell based on CMOS conductance and Hodgkin-Huxley formalism showed the corresponding spike bursts in the visual cortex. We show how the neuromorphic system can be implemented using the orientation selectivity and the neural computing to detect the human object or other objects under the limited illumination conditions, regardless of using the fixed camera or mobile camera. The early stage investigation demonstrated the feasibility in various applications, such as the intelligent monitoring of vehicle passengers for the extended emergency service of eCall, the automotive active safety system of object detection and avoidance, or the smart user experience by detecting the human behaviour. Our conclusion is that the neuromorphic mimicking of the visual cortex, coupled with neural networks, suggests it as the new feasible and robust device for the convergence of biological neural system and information technology.\nBrief Biography of the Speaker: Il Song Han was born on 1st February 1956.

They agree that addressing these dual challenges requires pushing for innovations to rebuild the competitive edges of universities.\nThis summit is one of KAIST's series of events to envision the future of KAIST and higher education in celebration of its 50th anniversary. The online summit will be live streamed on KAIST's official YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/c/KAISTofficial) on February 3, 2021, from 10 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. Korean time (February 2, 7:00-9:00 p.m. CST and 8:00-10:00 p.m. EST, respectively).\nThe KAIST Summit titled \"The Roles and Responsibilities of Universities in a Global Crisis\" will discuss a range of issues affecting many aspects of universities in the coming decades.\n\"This summit will allow us to measure the level of risk that universities face today and will face in the future. Although there will be varying views on what a post-COVID world might look like, one thing for sure is that universities cannot go back to the way they used to exist and operate. Moreover, the 4IR continues to infiltrate and shake up our daily lives. Changes are inevitable, and universities must pursue bold and innovative responses to remain sustainable and relevant to society,\" said KAIST President Sung-Chul Shin on the background of hosting the event.\nThe keynote speakers include KAIST President Shin, MIT President L. Rafael Reif, Tokyo Tech President Kazuya Masu, and Northwestern University President Morton Schapiro.

        "passage": "Systemic reform backed by strong investment has brought rapid and long-lasting results.\nLeigh Dayton is science and innovation writer based in Sydney, Australia.\nSouth Korea\u2019s position as one of the world\u2019s most innovative nations is a remarkable achievement considering that, for the first half of the twentieth century, it was an agrarian-based Japanese colony, then a battle ground.\nIt is second only to Germany in Bloomberg\u2019s 2020 Innovation Index, having reigned at the top of the 60-country list for the previous 5 years. In the separate 2019 Global Innovation Index, published by Cornell University, INSEAD and the World Intellectual Property Organization, South Korea is at number 11 and Germany is in 9th place among the 129 countries ranked.\nBoth indices highlight South Korea\u2019s outstanding performance in research and development (R&D) intensity, an indicator based on R&D investment by government and industry and the number of researchers working in and between both sectors. For example, South Korea had the greatest share of researchers who moved from industry to academia in 2017 to 2019 among 71 countries, data from academic recruitment firm, League of Scholars, show.\nThe high R&D intensity that helped South Korea become a global leader in information and communication technologies has emerged from a historically \u2018top-down\u2019 innovation system that promotes \u201cclose collaboration between government, industry, and the academic community in the process of nation building\u201d, says Tim Mazzarol from the University of Western Australia in Perth, who specializes in innovation and entrepreneurship.\nPresident Park Chung-hee drove South Korea\u2019s economic development between 1961, when he took power in a military coup, until 1979, when he was assassinated. Park shifted the economy from its post-war dependence on technology imports and the construction of industrial facilities by foreign companies to focus on home-grown labour-intensive industries, such as clothing and textiles. Crucially, strong support for R&D was central to his first Five-Year Economic Development Plan in 1962 and manifest in his establishment of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) in 1966, and the Ministry of Science and Technology the following year.\nThese instruments supported the emergence of large industrial groups called chaebols, which were owned and controlled by South Korean individuals or families. The government pushed the chaebols to invest heavily in R&D while shielding them from competition. With increased R&D intensity that focused on applied knowledge, chaebols such as LG, Lotte and Samsung were driven towards new heavy industries, including petrochemicals, car manufacturing and shipbuilding, as well as consumer electronics.\nSamsung is a case in point. The company that started life as a grocery trader in 1938 is now South Korea\u2019s largest chaebol, operating in industries as diverse as electronics, insurance, construction and shipbuilding. In 2018, it produced roughly 15% of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product.\nIts founder, Lee Byung Chul, with help from government protectionist policies, expanded into textiles after the Korean War, electronics in the 1960s, then heavy industries, aerospace and computing during the 1970s and early 1980s. By the 1990s and 2000s, Samsung was a world leader in tablets and mobiles, and in the design and manufacture of computer chips. The company is South Korea\u2019s leading corporate institution in the Nature Index by far, based on contributions to research articles published in the 82 high-quality natural science journals tracked by the Index. With a Share of 10.36 in 2019, it ranked 28th among the country\u2019s institutions overall, eclipsing its nearest rival in the corporate ranks, LG, which had a Share of 1.99. Samsung also features in each of South Korea\u2019s nine leading corporate-academic collaborative pairs in the Nature Index.\nThe most productive pairing is with Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) in Seoul, with 159 joint articles between 2015 and 2019. Their collaboration is particularly strong in electrochemistry and the development of new energy sources such as lithium-ion batteries (J. K. Shon et al. Nature Commun. 7, 11049; 2016). Other partnerships include Seoul National University in Seoul, (41 articles) and the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in Daejeon (35 articles).\nSamsung Group\u2019s top ten collaborating academic partners on articles in the Nature Index journals are split between United States and domestic institutions. Here they are ranked by bilateral collaboration score (CS), 2015\u201319. CS is derived by summing each institution\u2019s Share on the papers to which authors from both have contributed.\nPark\u2019s successors continued to promote research and innovation as the driver of national economic and social advance. Government and industry investment in R&D soared, and basic-research capabilities were expanded. By the mid-1980s and early 1990s the government\u2019s attention had shifted to high-tech industries such as semiconductor design and manufacture. For instance, in 1971 it founded KAIST, which remains a leading national research university (see \u2018Manipulating brains with smartphones\u2019).\nA team of researchers at KAIST \u2014 not to be confused with the KIST, with which it was initially integrated \u2014 has fulfilled a dream of neuroscientists worldwide.\nWorking with colleagues at the University of Washington in Seattle, they have built a novel device capable of remotely controlling the brain circuitry of mice, via a smartphone. It is the first wireless neural device that can continuously deliver multiple drugs and coloured light beams to control brain circuits. Until now, researchers needed rigid metal tubes and optical fibres to accomplish the task.\nThe device could speed up the study of diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s, addiction, depression and pain, says team leader and electrical engineer, Jeong Jae-Woong. Weighing 2 grams, it uses LEGO-like replaceable drug cartridges, a probe the thickness of a human hair, and powerful, low-energy Bluetooth to deliver the drugs and light, which turn neurones on or off without hurting the rodents. This \u2018plug-and-play\u2019 interface was the major challenge, Jeong says.\nAfter two years of laboratory and animal trials, the proof-of-concept paper was published in Nature Biomedical Engineering (R. Qazi et al. Nature Biomed. Eng. 3, 655\u2013669; 2019) by the team of neuroscientists and engineers from electrical, mechanical and software backgrounds. Jeong plans to commercialize the device and technology.\nTargeted nation-building programmes were also established. In 1995, for example, the government began a US$1.5-billion, ten-year plan to build up the national broadband infrastructure and provide public programmes about maximizing its use.\nThe 1997 Asian Financial Crisis prompted many chaebols to shift from the reliance on low-value added exports characteristic of a \u2018tiger\u2019 economy towards technology and knowledge-intensive products and services such as semiconductors, mobile phones and mobile applications.\nWorking with chaebols, the government began developing regional innovation centres such as Gyeonggi, an area of nearly 13 million people surrounding Seoul, which is now regarded as the nation\u2019s economic and innovative powerhouse.\nThe centre brought industry R&D and production infrastructure together with local and national universities and research facilities.

LSA used KVH\u2019s DSP-3000 FOG in its BASE enclosure using sensor fusion to provide autonomous navigation.\nWith its expertise in dynamic sensing-related projects and proven track record with Carnegie Mellon University, KVH was the ideal choice, and its sensors performed flawlessly during the race.\nWhile DARPA set out to expedite the research and development of the military use of autonomous ground vehicles in this demanding race, the 2005 DARPA Challenge also highlighted the value, precision, and affordability of KVH sensors.\nAs a result, KVH FOG technology and FOG-based inertial systems are now a cornerstone of successful and accurate autonomous navigation and stabilization, logging more than one million miles of autonomous driving.\nTen years later, KVH played a critical role in another DARPA autonomy project. The 2015 DARPA Robotics Challenge sought to promote innovation in human-supervised robotic technology for disaster response and to create robots more capable of intervening for and even replacing humans in high-risk situations such as the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, earthquakes, natural disasters, and other crises.\nOf the 25 finalists, 11 integrated KVH\u2019s 1750 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) into the robots\u2019 navigation and stabilization systems, improving their ability to fulfill challenge tasks such as walking up and down stairs, opening a sealed door, driving a vehicle, using a drill, etc.\nAmong the 11 robots relying upon KVH\u2019s IMU was the winning entry, robot DRC-HUBO by Team Kaist of Daejeon, Republic of Korea.\nUsing those systems and experience as a foundation, KVH recently developed a breakthrough in FOG technology with its photonic integrated chip (PIC)-based FOG.\nFOG technology is based on the Sagnac Effect, which uses light to measure rotation and is known for its precision and stability.\nAlthough incremental advancements had been made over time in fiber quality, diameter, and gyro coil size, major technological breakthroughs in the basic technology were few and far between until 2019, when KVH introduced a FOG-based sensor with PIC Inside.\nThis groundbreaking design improves reliability and repeatability \u2013 qualities essential to accurate autonomous navigation of all types of platforms, from driverless cars to autonomous inventory control robots \u2013 and represents a renaissance in FOG technology.\nOffered with a range of high-end accelerometers, KVH\u2019s new P-series IMUs and PIC-enhanced gyros deliver precise, reliable, and affordable navigation data in all environments and weather conditions.\nIn addition, when GPS/GNSS is unavailable due to terrain or artificial blockages, KVH\u2019s superior photonic FOG-based inertial systems enhance GPS/GNSS by filling in the navigation data gaps until the satellite signals are available once again.\nLarge outdoor Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) uses the KVH DSP-3000 for corrections to track its heading between embedded magnet-in-the-road waypoints.\nIt\u2019s easy to understand Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) appeal given their low cost and small size. However, small and cheap can\u2019t mask the challenges MEMS<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "I have a very special relationship with Korea and the ITTP program in particular. I have always considered Korea to be my second home country and I have good reasons for thinking like that. It is a place where I re-discovered my life in ways I wouldn\u2019t have even imagined. It all began in the Spring of 2008 when my elder brother was accepted into Global ITTP program for pursuing a Ph. D degree. At that time, he was working in the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology back in Afghanistan while I was in high school. In early 2009, my brother sent us a recorded video of his life in ITTP. My entire family and I really loved the video in which he showed us his lab at Munji campus, his Hwaam dormitory, and some areas around Jeonmin Dong. It was my first time seeing the streets of Korea and it enchanted me right away. I was mesmerized by the beauty of Korea and I just loved how organized the system and everything else looked in the video. My brother told me to study hard in high school, get good grades, and apply for a university in Korea. This was really motivating. I pictured myself walking in the streets of Jeonmin Dong, someday, like my brother did. However, it was only a dream at that time. A dream that I didn\u2019t know would become a reality in exactly one year after seeing the video. Motivated and driven by the idea to study in Korea someday, I worked really hard in high school and got very good grades. I applied for the Korean Government Scholarship Program (KGSP) and impatiently waited for the results for two months. Then, one evening I got a call from my brother saying to check the KGSP website for the results because I got the scholarship. This news was unbelievably euphoric and I couldn\u2019t hold back my tears of joy. Thus, I came to Korea in 2010 to attend one year of preparatory Korean language program and 4 years bachelor\u2019s degree at Chungnam National University.\nFrom April 2010 until February 2011, I studied Korean language. It was probably one of the most challenging things I ever did in my life. I didn\u2019t even know the basic Korean alphabets. I had to start completely from the scratch. The people I attended class with already had some knowledge of Korean language, but I didn\u2019t. This meant I had to work twice as hard. My hard work paid off and, by December 2010, I was almost fluent in Korean. I passed TOPIK level 4 in January 2011 and started my bachelor\u2019s degree in March of the same year. For the next four years I strengthened my Korean skills further and enjoyed my student life in Daejeon. By the time I graduated, my Korean language skills had reached TOPIK level 6. After graduating in 2015, I got another KGSP scholarship through the recommendation of Korean embassy in Afghanistan. But this time I didn\u2019t attend the one-year language program as I was granted exception from it because of my TOPIK level. For my master\u2019s, I attended Chonnam National University in Gwangju city where I had wonderful times. I developed further and got to know the ins and outs of the business world. I graduated in February 2017 and went to Afghanistan in March of the same year. Given my academic background, I was able to land a job at the Office of the President of Afghanistan in just two weeks after arriving there. It was a wonderful experience working at the top national institute. I learned a great deal about politics, policy, and how things work at a national level. This job matured me by 10 years in just a matter of a few months. However, it was not without risks or dangers. I survived two suicide bombing attacks while working there. The details of which are too gruesome to be shared. Anyways, after working there for a year, I joined a special team appointed by the President of Afghanistan at the Ministry of Transport for digitalizing the transport sector. The job was very important and fulfilling but Korea kept pulling me back. This was when I applied for ITTP program and got accepted for a Ph. D degree. Professor Rho interviewed me and, I have to say, it was very intense because he asked very to the point and challenging questions.\nSo, after a little over two years in Afghanistan, I came back to Korea in August 2019. This was another dream come true as I always wanted to do a Ph. D. The first semester in ITTP was truly magical; from experts\u2019 seminars, to forums and conferences. Also, from cultural trips, to internal collaboration events \u2013 these all had profound impacts on my personal and professional life. The intensive Korean classes by Professor Chun and Taekwondo classes by Master Jang were wonderful in terms of practicing Korean and extracurricular activities. And, then COVID-19 pandemic hit; an unprecedented event which affected the entire globe and its impact is still felt to the day. This pandemic literally transformed everything around us. Yet, while others saw threats and fear, I saw opportunities. I worked on my health losing a lot of weight (20 kg), completed two research papers, (one of which got published in an SSCI level journal), worked on my Korean skills and the most significant of it all - I met my wife. Yes! I met the love of my life in the midst of the pandemic. I thank the Korean language and ITTP for that. Let me tell you how that happened. It all began about a year ago when I saw a post on Facebook. This post was from Jessica, my wife, but of course at that time I had not even imagined that we would end up marrying. Jessica posted that she had recently come to Korea and was looking for someone to help her with practicing Korean. I wanted to socialize and figured that it wouldn\u2019t hurt to meet new people. So, I nervously sent a message to her. I was apprehensive because it was not easy to just randomly send someone a message without knowing how the other person would react. I told Jessica that I had lived in Korea for about 9 years and spoke Korean well. I told her that I did my bachelor\u2019s, Master\u2019s and, was doing Ph. D in KAIST then. She responded to me very positively and we started communicating. There was no hidden agenda from either of our sides. We were both very sincere and honest with one another - no lies, no drama, and no games. We just wanted to be friends and practice Korean, oblivious to the fact that we would get married in the future. So, we met about two weeks after chatting for the first time. When we met for the first time, we knew from the very beginning that we were more alike than either of us had thought. Our relationship developed very nicely and, in a few months, we got engaged and after that we got married. A lot of things had to go right for that to happen and a lot of things did go right in our favor. Jessica and I believe that it was fate that brought us together. I love her with all my heart and she loves me the same. The best part is that both of our families have accepted us and love<|endoftext|>"

Now it is gaining prominence on the global research scene, as it strives to nurture the economic leaders of the future.\n\nFounded by the government decades ago, the institution calls the central city of Daejeon home and operates outside the regular education system. Among its notable recent achievements: A KAIST team won the top prize at last year's DARPA Robotics Challenge, a competition organized by the U.S. Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.\n\nThe team was one of 24 groups from prestigious colleges and labs in five countries and a territory. The competition included Carnegie Mellon University of the U.S. and the University of Tokyo. The goal was to demonstrate how humanoid robots can assist with disaster relief efforts.\n\nThe KAIST team won $2 million.\n\nThe school's endeavors are drawing interest from some of the world's biggest technology players. \"We have provided two humanoid robots of this type to Google,\" said a postgraduate student at KAIST.\n\nThe lab the student belongs to was packed with tools, along with debris for testing the robots' rubble removal capabilities. A cat was sleeping nearby.\n\nFREEDOM TO EDUCATE KAIST was established in 1971 by the government of President Park Chung-hee, the father of current President Park Geun-hye. The country was undergoing a growth spurt that became known as the Miracle on the Han River.\n\nFor centuries, those who studied the humanities were the ones who reached the top in South Korea. But the Park Chung-hee government saw heavy chemicals and machinery as essential industries that could drive the country's economy. The government asked a renowned Stanford University professor to draw up plans for a science and technology college that could support the country's industrialization and prevent a brain drain.\n\nThe government crafted special legislation to govern KAIST, freeing it from the constraints of the conventional education system. Unlike other schools, which operate under the Ministry of Education, KAIST falls under the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning.\n\n\"Our advantage is to be able to design unique education programs freely,\" college President Kang Sung-mo said.\n\nFor example, the school launched an initiative called Education 3.0 about five years ago. Under the program, students are expected to view video lectures before classes. This way, they can spend class time asking professors questions and debating among themselves.\n\nThe school's residence hall has a special area to accommodate students who are interested in starting businesses. An adviser who graduated from Stanford and launched a business is on hand.\n\nAt one point, the college was accepting large numbers of competitive high school students in their second year before graduation, though it has scaled down such recruiting.\n\nTuition is free for all students. Male enrollees are typically exempted from the compulsory two years of military service. The government allocates exemptions to colleges each year, and KAIST is usually given the most, according to Korea's Military Manpower Administration.\n\nLast year, some 300 first-year doctoral students at KAIST sought to be exempted; all of their requests were approved.\n\nThe college has produced a number of high-profile businesspeople. The list of graduates includes Kwon Oh-hyun, who serves as vice chairman and CEO of Samsung Electronics and is the highest-ranking executive outside the founding family. Another example is Lee Hae-jin, founder and chairman of internet search company Naver, the parent of messaging app operator Line.\n\nIn addition, some 1,400 businesses have been launched by the college's students, alumni and lecturers. As of 2014, nearly 60 of these companies were listed on stock exchanges.\n\nQuacquarelli Symonds, a British university evaluation agency, ranked KAIST sixth among Asian colleges this year. That is higher than Seoul National University, in 10th place, and the University of Tokyo, in 13th.\n\nStill, KAIST has a ways to go. Despite efforts to provide most classes in English, it has struggled to attract foreign students, who account for just 5% of the total. Its next mission is likely to be globalization.<|endoftext|>"

The highly light-sensitive property of photoactivatable Flp recombinase will be ideal for controlling genetic manipulation in deep mouse brain regions by illumination with a noninvasive light-emitting diode (LED). This optogeneticmodule made by Professor Won Do Heo and his team will provide a side-effect-free and expandable genetic manipulation tool for neuroscience research.\nIn the study, the team featured photoactivatable Flp recombinase by searching out split sites of Flp recombinase that were not previously identified, being capable of reconstitution to be active. The team validated the highly light-sensitive, efficient performance of photoactivatable Flp recombinase through precise light targeting by showing transgene expression within anatomically confined mouse brain regions.\nThe study is the result of five years of research by Professor Heo, who has led the bioimaging and optogenetics fields by developing his own bioimaging and optogenetics technologies. \"It will be a great advantage to control specific gene expression desired by LEDs with little physical and chemical stimulation that can affect the physiological phenomenon in living animals,\" he explains.\nResearchers have demonstrated a significant enhancement of brain-machine interface performance using an optical neural interface to photostimulate neurons.\nDrawing inspiration from optogenetics, a team of researchers has developed a chip that replicates the way the brain stores and loses information.\nThe work could lead to a way to noninvasively control transplanted neural progenitor cells with light to restore lost functions in stroke recovery.\nAn optogenetics technique showed that a group of hormone neurons increase REM sleep when the need for body temperature defense is minimized.\nThe brain imaging method is based on a recent bioluminescence-based indicator of membrane voltage to record brain activity simultaneously in multiple, freely moving mice.\nThe confocal microscopy system could better observe how large networks of neurons interact during various behaviors.\nIdentifying these neurons opens the door to developing drug therapies or even gene therapies for alcohol addiction.\nThe team has been using optogenetics to focus on genes whose expression occurs in a neural activity-dependent manner.\nThe photoswitchable molecule that the researchers used bends when exposed to IR light.\nCombining the two microscopy techniques could potentially offer rapid, detailed images of wide swaths of brain tissue.<|endoftext|>"

However, realizing it has been a difficult challenge not only from the roll-based manufacturing perspective but also for creating roll-based packaging for the interconnection of flexible LSI with flexible displays, batteries, and other peripheral devices.\nTo overcome these challenges, the research team started fabricating NAND flash memories on a silicon wafer using conventional semiconductor processes, and then removed a sacrificial wafer leaving a top hundreds-nanometer-thick circuit layer. Next, they simultaneously transferred and interconnected the ultrathin device on a flexible substrate through the continuous roll-packaging technology using anisotropic conductive film (ACF). The final silicon-based flexible NAND memory successfully demonstrated stable memory operations and interconnections even under severe bending conditions. This roll-based flexible LSI technology can be potentially utilized to produce flexible application processors (AP), high-density memories, and high-speed communication devices for mass manufacture.\nPicture 2: The flexible silicon NAND flash memory is attached to a 7 mm diameter glass rod.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " shading ring keeps the solenoid retracted, eliminating the bothersome chatter.\nWhile any solenoid will run on AC or DC, care needs to be taken to observe the coil\u2019s specs. Solenoids represent an inductive load, and so their impedance is much higher in AC applications. So if a solenoid rated for 24 VAC were powered by 24 VDC, it would probably burn out quickly as the current through it would exceed the design specs. This could be avoided with a current limiting resistor or by lowering the DC supply voltage.\nLike their cousin the relay, solenoids have the potential to damage whatever circuit is controlling them. When the current flowing through a solenoid or relay coil is removed, the voltage spikes as the magnetic field collapses. If that spike gets into sensitive components, like a transistor driving the coil, the device could be destroyed. The classic remedy for this with DC coils is the snubber diode, connected in parallel across the coil with the anode on the negative side. The snubber gives the induced current somewhere to go when the power is removed from the coil to prevent it from inducing the high voltage spike. Snubber diodes won\u2019t work on AC coils, so an RC snubber, with a small resistance and capacitance in series with each other placed in parallel across the coil, serves the same purpose.\nThis is only a brief look at what solenoids are and do, and how to incorporate these mechanisms into your designs.\nWe describe a new training methodology for generative adversarial networks. The key idea is to grow both the generator and discriminator progressively, starting from low-resolution images, and add new layers that deal with higher resolution details as the training progresses. This greatly stabilizes the training and allows us to produce images of unprecedented quality, e.g., CelebA images at 1024\u00b2 resolution. We also propose a simple way to increase the variation in generated images, and achieve a record inception score of 8.80 in unsupervised CIFAR10. Additionally, we describe several small implementation details that are important for discouraging unhealthy competition between the generator and discriminator. Finally, we suggest a new metric for evaluating GAN results, both in terms of image quality and variation. As an additional contribution we construct a higher quality version of the CelebA dataset that allows meaningful exploration up to the resolution of 1024\u00b2 pixels.\nThis orange battery was built by photographer Caleb Charland (previously) as part of his ongoing alternative energy photographs using fruit, vegetables, and other objects to create light for his long-exposure photographs. The electricity powering the lightbulb inside the orange is generated through a chemical reaction between citric acid and the zinc nails inserted into each wedge. I think this is by far the most lovely piece he\u2019s done in the series, but before you start work on a bunch of orange lights to keep on the nightstand, the light generated was so dim this particular photograph required a 14 hour exposure.\nTeam KAIST hat mit dem DRC-Hubo gestern in Pomona/Kalifornien die DARPA Robotics Challenge gewoonen, einen von DARPA (einer Beh\u00f6rde des US-Verteidigungsministeriums) organisierten Wettbewerb f\u00fcr humanoide Roboter.\nKAIST steht \u00fcbrigens f\u00fcr \u201cKorea Advanced Institute for Science and Technology\u201d und ist die f\u00fchrende Technische Universit\u00e4t in Korea.

The process might lead to scaffolds for repair or replacement of load-bearing tissues, such as cartilage. It could also allow for tough but flexible actuators for future robots, the researchers say.\nZhao says the process can produce complex hydrogel structures that are \u201cextremely tough and robust,\u201d but still allow for encapsulating cells in the structures. That could make it possible to 3D-print complex biostructures.\nHydrogels are defined by water molecules encased in rubbery polymer networks that provide shape and structure. They are similar to natural tissues such as cartilage, which is used by the body as a natural shock absorber.\nWhile synthetic hydrogels are commonly weak or brittle, a number of them that are tough and stretchable have been developed over the last decade. However, making tough hydrogels has usually involved \u201charsh chemical environments\u201d that would kill living cells encapsulated in them, Zhao says.\nThe new hydrogel materials are generated by combining polyethylene glycol (PEG) and sodium alginate, which synergize to form a hydrogel tougher than natural cartilage. The materials are benign enough to synthesize together with living cells \u2014 such as stem cells \u2014 which could then allow high viability of the cells, says Zhao, who holds a joint appointment in MIT\u2019s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.\nPrevious work was not able to produce complex 3-D structures with tough hydrogels, Zhao says. The new biocompatible tough hydrogel can be printed into diverse 3-D structures such as a hollow cube, hemisphere, pyramid, twisted bundle, multilayer mesh, or physiologically relevant shapes, such as a human nose or ear.\nThe new method uses a commercially available 3D-printing mechanism, Zhao explains. \u201cThe innovation is really about the material \u2014 a new ink for 3-D printing of biocompatible tough hydrogel,\u201d he says, specifically, a composite of two different biopolymers.\nThe PEG material provides elasticity to the printed material, while sodium alginate allows it to dissipate energy under deformation without breaking. A third ingredient, a biocompatible \u201cnanoclay,\u201d makes it possible to fine-tune the viscosity (how easily it flows) of the material, improving the ability to control its flow through the 3D-printing nozzle.\nSuch materials might eventually be used to custom-print shapes for the replacement of cartilaginous tissues in ears, noses, or load-bearing body joints, Zhao says. Lab tests have already shown that the material is even tougher than natural cartilage.\nThe technique could also be applied to printing a variety of soft but tough structural materials, he says, such as actuators for soft robotic systems.\n\u201cThis is really beautiful work that demonstrates major advances in the utilization of tough hydrogels,\u201d says David Mooney, a professor of bioengineering at Harvard University who was not involved in this work. \u201cThis builds off earlier work using other polymer systems, with some of this earlier work done by Dr. Zhao, but the demonstration that one can achieve similar mechanical performance with a common biomedical polymer is a substantial advance.\nThe work was supported by the National Institutes of Health, the Office of Naval Research, AOSpine Foundation, and the National Science Foundation.\nA 3D printable and highly stretchable tough hydrogel is developed by combining poly(ethylene glycol) and sodium alginate, which synergize to form a hydrogel tougher than natural cartilage. Encapsulated cells maintain high viability over a 7 d culture period and are highly deformed together with the hydrogel. By adding biocompatible nanoclay, the tough hydrogel is 3D printed in various shapes without requiring support material.\nThe Strandbeest: Art and Engineering.\nCreated by Dutch artist Theo Jansen, the Strandbeest is created by rudimentary objects such as PVC piping, wood and sails and contains no electrical or motorised parts; it is instead powered by the wind.\nThe Strandbeest has steadily evolved into more complex working structures. Some even having the ability to store wind power in the absence of a breeze, being able to nail pins into the sand when wind power becomes too great, and even sensing when they have entered the water or encountered an object so they can then avoid the obstruction.\nTheo Jansen is ever improving and changing these creatures, and does have a final plan for them saying: \u201cover time, these skeletons have become increasingly better at surviving the elements such as storms and water, and eventually I want to put these animals out in herds on the beaches, so they will live their own lives\u201d.<|endoftext|>"

When we measured the accuracy of localization at an E-Mart, Seoul, Korea and a KAIST Library, Daejeon, Korea with and without uncaught signal imputation, the imputed signal resulted in around 30% better accuracy improvement than the signals without imputation. In addition, the imputation methods using WRM information showed significantly better accuracy than using a fixed value for uncaught AP signals.

We would like to form a cooperative, commercialization agreement with McAllen and UTPA,\u201d Patridge explained.\nThe Miguel Patridge refers to is Professor Miguel Gonzalez, dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science at UTPA. Gonzalez accompanied the MEDC officials on the trip.\nPatridge explained the rationale for developing relations with KAIST.\n\u201cWe have been rightly focusing on education and training and UTPA and STC do excellent job. But, if we keep doing a good job with our educational institutions but there are no jobs it is a zero sum game. Forty years from now we will still be in the same place we are today.\nThe City of Daejeon has a population of 1.5 million people, not much more than the Valley. However, it is much wealthier. It has an annual budget $2.8 billion a year. Its gross domestic product is $27 billion. \u201cThe national government has put a lot of money into research in Daejeon,\u201d Patridge said.\nPatridge said the City of Daejeon only has about two Sister City agreements. \u201cThey are very guarded about who they enter into agreements with. We feel honored to have been selected.\u201d McAllen Mayor Jim Darling and UTPA President Robert Nelsen had hoped to be on the trip to Daejeon but were prevented from doing so by pressing matters at home. They hope to go on a future trip. Darling did appear in a video about McAllen that was presented to Daejeon officials.\nThe City of McAllen and McAllen EDC have been making regular visits to Korea since 1990. On the first trip were then McAllen Mayor Othal Brand, then McAllen City Commissioner Jan Klinck, then McAllen EDC President Mike Allen, and Patridge. Patridge said it was because of the beautification of the Korean cities they visited that made Brand insist on his city be spruced up by its parks and recreation department.\n\u201cKorea was much different back in 1990. It was an emerging country. It was still a bit wild and wooly. We were told not to drink the water in the hotel room. But it was absolutely beautiful, as clean as can be. It was just after Korea hosted the 1988 Summer Olympics,\u201d Patridge remembers.\nThe relationships forged on that and subsequent visits are starting to pay off now, Patridge said. In fact, one of the reasons for the latest trip was so that Korean officials could learn about the rapid response project being undertaken by the North American Advanced Manufacturing Research and Education Initiative, which McAllen EDC and UTPA are part of.\n\u201cThere is a whole strategic plan behind this that I am not going to get into but it would make a lot of sense if we could tell you about it. The folks from KAIST come over once a year, bringing companies that may be interested in building a manufacturing operation here, and then, once a year, we go over there and take our companies to see Daejeon,\u201d Patridge said.\n\u201cWe have to develop our research park. We have to have a top quality university, which we are developing, and we have to have a research component. And, we have to get our first building for the research park. It costs money and so the question is, how do we fund it? It is unlikely that it will come from the federal government. How do we get the citizenry of McAllen to invest in this? How do we explain we could be the KAIST of Texas?\n\u201cWe have to tell people what the potential is and see if they want it. This is another of those watershed moments, like the maquila concept. It is up to the citizenry of this region but we believe it is an investment in our grandkids. That is what we have got to think about it,\u201d Patridge added.<|endoftext|>"

The device is capable of multiplexed detection of Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus. The limit of detection for each bacterium was characterized, and then, the detection of bacteria from contaminated fresh lettuces was demonstrated for two representative foodborne pathogens. We employed a sample pretreatment protocol to recover and concentrate target bacteria from contaminated lettuces, which can detect 1.87 \u00d7 10 CFU of E. coli O157:H7 and 1.47 \u00d7 10 CFU of S.

Previous research indicates that the roots of growing leafy greens and berries internalize human NoV. However the effect of plant type and inoculum level on internalization rates has not been directly compared. In this study we compared the internalization and dissemination rates of human NoV and its surrogate, Tulane virus (TV) in green onion, radishes, and Romaine lettuce. We also evaluated the effect inoculum level and plant growth matrix on the rate of viral internalization. In the hydroponic growth system, we detected internalization and dissemination of human NoV RNA in green onions. In hydroponically growing green onions inoculated with high titer TV, we found higher rates of internalization and dissemination compared to green onions inoculated with low titer TV. In soil growth systems, no infectious TV was detected in either green onion or radishes. However, in Romaine lettuce plants grown in soil approximately 4 log PFU/g was recovered from all tissues on day 14 p.i. Overall, we found that the type of plant, growth matrix, and the inoculum level influences the internalization and dissemination of human NoV and TV.\n[Ad] Endere\u00e7o: CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Research Centre Pantnagar, Udham Singh Nagar, Uttarakhand, India.\n[Ti] T\u00edtulo: Chemical composition and antibacterial, antifungal, allelopathic and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities of cassumunar-ginger.\n[So] Source: J Sci Food Agric;98(1):321-327, 2018 Jan.\n[Ab] Resumo: BACKGROUND: Zingiber montanum (J.Koenig) Link ex A.Dietr. (Zingiberaceae), commonly known as cassumunar-ginger, is a folk remedy for the treatment of inflammations, sprains, rheumatism and asthma. The aim of the present study was to assess the chemical composition, and antibacterial, antifungal, allelopathic and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities of the essential oil of Z. montanum originating from India. RESULTS: The hydrodistilled essential oil of Z. montanum rhizome was analyzed using gas chromatography-flame ionization detection and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 49 constituents, forming 98.7-99.9% of the total oil compositions, was identified. The essential oil was characterized by higher amount of monoterpene hydrocarbons (32.6-43.5%), phenylbutanoids (27.5-41.2%) and oxygenated monoterpenes (11.4-34.1%). Major constituents of the oil were sabinene (13.5-38.0%), (E)-1-(3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene (DMPBD) (20.6-35.3%), terpinen-4-ol (9.0-31.3%), \u00ce\u00b3-terpinene (1.1-4.8%) and \u00df-phellandrene (1.0-4.4%). The oil was evaluated against eight pathogenic bacteria and two fungal strains. It exhibited low to good antibacterial activity (minimum inhibitory concentration: 125-500 \u00b5g mL ) and moderate antifungal activity (250 \u00b5g mL ) against the tested strains. The oil reduced germination (69.8%) and inhibited the root and shoot growth of lettuce significantly (LD : 3.58 \u00b5L plate ). However, it did not demonstrate acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity up to a concentration of 10 mg mL. CONCLUSIONS: The essential oil of Z. montanum can be used as a potential source of DMPBD, terpinen-4-ol and sabinene for pharmaceutical products. The results of the present study add significant information to the pharmacological activity of Z. montanum native to India. \u00a9 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.\n[Ad] Endere\u00e7o: Agricultural Clean Watershed Innovation Group, Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture, CAAS; Key Laboratory for Agricultural Environment MOA, Beijing, 100081, China.\n[Ti] T\u00edtulo: Performance of five plant species in removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from an experimental phytoremediation system in the Ningxia irrigation area.\n[So] Source: Environ Monit Assess;189(10):497, 2017 Sep 10.\n[Ab] Resumo: Agricultural non-point source (ANPS) pollution is an important contributor to elevated nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in surface waters, which can cause serious environmental problems. Considerable effort has therefore gone into the development of methods that control the ANPS input of N and P to surface waters. Phytoremediation has been extensively used because it is cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and efficient. The N and P loads from agricultural drainage are a potential threat to the water quality of the Yellow River in Ningxia, China. Yet, phytoremediation has only rarely been applied within the Ningxia irrigation area. In an experimental set-up, five species (Ipomoea aquatica, IA; Lactuca sativa, LS; Oryza sativa, OS; Typha latifolia, TL; Zizania latifolia, ZL) were evaluated for their ability to reduce N and P loads over 62 days and five observation periods. Total N and P concentrations, plant biomass, and nutrient content were measured. The results showed that OS, LS, and IA performed better than ZL and TL in terms of nutrients removal, biomass accumulation, and nutrients storage. The highest overall removal rates of N and P (57.7 and 57.3%, respectively) were achieved by LS treatment. In addition, plant uptake contributed significantly to nutrient removal, causing a 25.9-72.0% reduction in N removal and a 54.3-86.5% reduction in P removal. Thus, this study suggests that OS, LS, and IA would be more suitable than ZL and TL for controlling nutrient loads in the Ningxia irrigation area using phytoremediation.\n[Ad] Endere\u00e7o: Western Triangle Ag Research Center, Montana State University, Conrad, MT, United States of America.\n[Ti] T\u00edtulo: Role of the aphid species and their feeding locations in parasitization behavior of Aphelinus abdominalis, a parasitoid of the lettuce aphid Nasonovia ribisnigri.\n[Ab] Resumo: Aphid species feeding on lettuce occupy distinct feeding sites: the lettuce aphid Nasonovia ribisnigri prefers to feed on heart leaves, whereas the potato aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae feeds only on outer leaves. The aphid parasitoid Aphelinus abdominalis, known to be able to regulate M. euphorbiae on many crops, has recently been indicated as a promising biocontrol candidate also for use against N. ribisnigri, a major pest of lettuce. This study therefore examined A. abdominalis parasitization preference between N. ribisnigri and M. euphorbiae and its ability to parasitize aphids feeding on different parts of lettuce plants. In addition, life history traits of A. abdominalis on these aphid species were investigated. In no-choice laboratory experiments on leaf discs and 24 h exposure, A. abdominalis successfully parasitized 54% and 60% of<|endoftext|>"

While a number of previous studies have reported the mental bene\ufb01ts of green space, most had been conducted in the affluent parts of the world like the United States and Europe, and only a few involved a multi-country setting.\nLack of data had been the main limitation in carrying out these studies because there is no global medical dataset that can provide reliable and standardized mental health surveys from different countries. Another challenge involves a systematic method to measure the amount of green space across countries. Various methods of measuring green space \u2013 questionnaires, qualitative interviews, satellite images, Google Street View images, and even smartphone technology still rely on individual-level measurements and hence are not scalable to the global level. These challenges left the question of the association between the positive effect of green space on mental health open and unanswered for many countries with different socioeconomic conditions.\nLed by the Chief Investigator and an Associate Professor CHA Meeyoung at the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) and Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in Daejeon, South Korea, an international collaboration of researchers from POSTECH, Max Planck Institute, New Jersey Institute of Technology, and the National University of Singapore set out to tackle the issue.

Park Geun-hye narrowly defeated her rival, Moon Jae-in, in the presidential election on 19 December, and will become the country\u2019s first female president when she takes office on 25 February.\nSixty-year-old Park, who studied electronic engineering at Sogang University in Seoul, pledged during her campaign that science and technology policy would become the cornerstone of her government\u2019s work. Park\u2019s conservative Saenuri Party, which forms South Korea\u2019s current government under President Lee Myung-bak, plans to increase the total expenditure on research and development to 5% of the gross domestic product by 2017, up from 4% in 2011. The government\u2019s investment in basic science will rise from 35.2% of that total to 40% by 2017, Park said. She also aims to set up a new overarching \u2018ministry of future innovative science\u2019, which would be separate from the current Ministry of Education, Science and Technology.\nDae Kyong Kim, a pharmacist at Chung-Ang University who also worked on Park\u2019s campaign promises, thinks that her victory is a positive sign for the biotechnology industry. \u201cBiotechnology consumes so much time and money, but until now the support was insufficient and the investment was sporadically given.\u201d He is optimistic that \u201cthe new government will strengthen the country\u2019s competitiveness\u201d.\nOne of Park\u2019s main campaign pledges was to provide better welfare and a stable environment for scientists \u2014 by providing more support to female scientists who want to take career breaks to have children, for example \u2014 and to cut the unemployment rate among researchers.\nDuring the final campaign debate, Park also flagged the aerospace industry as an important yardstick of national power. North Korea\u2019s successful long-range rocket launch this month and South Korea\u2019s recent failures to loft a satellite of its own in to orbit are raising tensions in the region. \u201cNow is the moment to add momentum to the peaceful use of space,\u201d Park said. She promised to pull forward plans to send a landing module to the Moon from 2025 to 2020, and to develop a domestic satellite launcher to substitute the current Naro-1 rocket by 2021.\nPark is also a keen supporter of nuclear energy, which provides roughly 30% of the country\u2019s electricity. Park agreed with her presidential rival that it was important to develop the country\u2019s renewable-energy capacity, but that it could not be the sole source of the nation\u2019s power.\nPark\u2019s plans build on the controversial legacy of her father, South Korea\u2019s longest-serving dictator, Park Chung-hee. During his 18 years of autocratic rule he was criticized for widespread human-rights abuses, but he also brought rapid industrialization to the country. He founded numerous scientific institutions, including the nation\u2019s premier research centre, the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), and the Daedeok Science Town in Daejeon. Chung-hee also invested heavily in the country\u2019s energy infrastructure, building a rash of power plants and research centres for hydroelectric, thermoelectric, nuclear and solar energy.<|endoftext|>"

There is no professor to teach.\nIn order to grow the qualitative growth of the semiconductor industry, which is the basis of our export economy, the government has established an advanced semiconductor department at major universities from next year to foster talent. In order to develop long-term competitiveness in the global semiconductor industry, the goal is to promote not only investment in semiconductor facilities but also professional manpower.\nHowever, as the semiconductor industry and academia have been steadily raising their voices in fostering talent, they are welcoming the government\u2019s policy, but there are also concerns that there is a lack of professional professors to raise semiconductor personnel. It is pointed out that the number of semiconductor students will increase from March next year, and there is no professional professor to teach semiconductors.\nThe domestic semiconductor industry is currently suffering from serious semiconductor workforce. According to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, there are about 14,600 people in the domestic semiconductor field by 2030. The annual shortage of the semiconductor industry reached 1,621 by 2020. The Korea Semiconductor Industry Association predicted that about 30,000 people were shortened in the semiconductor field over the next 10 years.\nAs of this year, there are about 150 students (Sungkyunkwan University, Yonsei University, Korea University) as of this year, and next year, 360 people (Sungkyunkwan University, Yonsei University, Korea University, KAIST, Pohang University, Sogang University, and Hanyang University) are expected. This is the number of students who are not enough for the manpower necessary in the industrial field.\nIn the end, the government took special measures to foster core semiconductor personnel.\nThe Ministry of Science and Technology will cultivate 3,140 practical talents for the next five years through the system semiconductor design practical workforce (bachelor\u2019s level) training project and artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductor talent training (Main and Ph.D.) on the 30th of last month. The goal. It is significant in that the industry and the four major science and technology institutes will cooperate to promote semiconductor talent.\nThe four major science and units, including Daejeon Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), GIST, Daegu Gyeongbuk, DGIST, Ulsan and UNIST, will introduce the semiconductor contract department to cultivate more than 200 academic talents every year from next year. did. The Department of Contract is a degree program in which an industry contracts and operates a contract with a university to foster customized personnel.\nAt the same time, the company also set the goal to expand the number of doctoral emissions of 220 doctors per year to more than 500 people within five years. In order to foster the master\u2019s class talent, KAIST and UNIST plans to strengthen the Graduate School of Industry-Academic Cooperation, and GIST and DGIST will review the installation of semiconductor graduate schools or semiconductor majors.\nIn addition, the Ministry of Science and Technology selected three places, Seoul National University, Sungkyunkwan University, and Soongsil University to foster AI semiconductor personnel. The three selected universities are supported by about 1.4 billion won per university for three years. Each university will open an AI semiconductor union major with a large number of departments, including the Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Computer Engineering, Semiconductor System Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering.\nPresident Yoon Seok-yeol also empowered the fostering semiconductor talent. President Yoon said at the State Council held at the Yongsan President\u2019s Office on July 7, Semiconductor is the basis of our economy, which is a national security asset and the core of our industry, and accounts for 20%of the total exports. If there is a regulation, we will boldly solve it and if the government will apply for finances, we will apply boldly.\nHowever, industry experts argue that the establishment of semiconductor departments cannot solve manpower shortages. It is pointed out that even if the semiconductor contract department is introduced in succession, it is less effective because there is a lack of professional professors to raise these students. Universities faced the issue of securing faculty members until only half a year left in March<|endoftext|>"

Recently, the paracaspase MALT1 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of ABC-DLBCL. Herein, we report a new class of MALT1 inhibitors developed by high-throughput screening and structure-based drug design. The original hit, 4-amino-1,2-naphthoquinone series inhibited MALT1 activity but suffered from poor cellular activity. The extensive pharmacophore search led to the discovery of structurally similar \u03b2-lapachone that is a direct inhibitor of MALT1 and possesses favorable physicochemical properties. Molecular simulation studies suggested the possibility of the formation of a covalent bond between MALT1 and \u03b2-lapachone, which was corroborated by experimental wash-out studies. Inspired by this, we explored the structure-activity relationships by incorporating electron-withdrawing substituents at C8 position of \u03b2-lapachone. These MALT1 inhibitors exhibited potent antiproliferative activity to OCI-LY3 cell line and inhibited the cleavage of CYLD mediated MALT1.<|endoftext|>"

Ablation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) or the protein kinase Hippo signaling pathway induces liver cancer via activation of AKT or the transcriptional regulators YAP/TAZ, respectively; however, the potential for crosstalk between the PTEN/AKT and Hippo/YAP/TAZ pathways in liver tumorigenesis has thus far remained unclear. Here, we have shown that deletion of both PTEN and SAV1 in the liver accelerates the development of NAFLD and liver cancer in mice. At the molecular level, activation of YAP/TAZ in the liver of Pten-/- Sav1-/- mice amplified AKT signaling through the upregulation of insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) expression. Both ablation of YAP/TAZ and activation of the Hippo pathway could rescue these phenotypes. A high level of YAP/ TAZ expression was associated with a high level of IRS2 expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Moreover, treatment with the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 or knockout of IRS2 by AAV-Cas9 successfully repressed liver tumorigenesis in Pten-/- Sav1-/- mice. Thus, our findings suggest that Hippo signaling interacts with AKT signaling by regulating IRS2 expression to prevent NAFLD and liver cancer progression and provide evidence that impaired crosstalk between these 2 pathways accelerates NAFLD and liver cancer.\nKeywords: Hepatology; Metabolism; Mouse models.<|endoftext|>"

Epub 2011 Feb 3.\nDepartment of Chemical Engineering, College of Engineering, Kyung Hee University, 1 Seochon-dong, Giheung-gu, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do 446-701, Korea.\nWe demonstrated thermal transitions and physical gelation of binary ionic salts through interionic interactions, which consist of pyrrolidinium-N-propanesulfonate zwitterionic compound (PyrZIC) and lithium bis(trifluorosulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI). The transition behaviors of binary ionic gels were attributed to conformational changes in the cations and anions of PyrZIC and LiTFSI as analyzed by density functional theory (DFT), principal component analysis (PCA), and two-dimensional infrared correlation spectroscopy (2D IR COS). Furthermore, the geometries of binary PyrZIC-LiTFSI systems were strongly influenced by the electrostatic interactions between two ionic salts. The different dynamic processes in the PyrZIC- and LiTFSI-rich phases, which are classified by the transition point of PCA plots, were induced by the conformational changes in the respective interaction fields, as shown by 2D correlation spectra. In particular, LiTFSI-rich binary gels revealed characteristic four-leaf-clover and butterfly patterns under their unique chemical circumstances, which were different from those of PyrZIC-rich gels. Consequently, these computational and experimental investigations provide an analytical tool to understand the physical phenomenon and interactions occurring in the unveiled and complicated systems.\nMicrowave-assisted synthesis of highly water-soluble graphene towards electrical DNA sensor.\nNanoscale 2010 Dec 25;2(12):2692-7. Epub 2010 Oct 25.\nDepartment of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering (BK21), KAIST, 335 Gwahangno, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 305-701, Republic of Korea.\nGraphene sheets have the potential for practical applications in electrochemical devices, but their development has been impeded by critical problems with aggregation of graphene sheets. Here, we demonstrated a facile and bottom-up approach for fabrication of DNA sensor device using water-soluble sulfonated reduced graphene oxide (SRGO) sheets via microwave-assisted sulfonation (MAS), showing enhanced sensitivity, reliability, and low detection limit. Key to achieving these performances is the fabrication of the SRGOs, where the MAS method enabled SRGOs to be highly dispersed in water (10 mg mL(-1)) due to the acidic sulfonated groups generated within 3 min of the functionalization reaction. The water-soluble SRGO-DNA (SRGOD) hybrids prepared by electrostatic interactions between a flat single layer of graphene sheets and DNAs are suitable for fabrication of electrical DNA sensor devices because of the unique electrical characteristics of SRGODs. The high sensing performance of SRGOD sensors was demonstrated with detection of DNA hybridization using complementary DNAs, single base mismatched DNAs, and noncomplementary DNAs, with results showing higher sensitivity and lower detection limit than those of reduced graphene oxide-based DNA sensors. Simple and easy fabrication of DNA sensor devices using SRGODs is expected to provide an effective way for electrical detection of DNA hybridization using miniature sensors without the labor-intensive labeling of the sensor and complex measurement equipment.\nImmobilization of genetically engineered fusion proteins on gold-decorated carbon nanotube hybrid films for the fabrication of biosensor platforms.\nJ Colloid Interface Sci 2010 Oct 30;350(2):453-8. Epub 2010 Jun 30.\nDepartment of Chemical Engineering, Kyung Hee University, 1 Seocheon-dong, Giheung-gu, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do 446-701, Republic of Korea.\nWe have demonstrated the fabrication of the biosensor platforms by means of the integration of the genetically engineered fusion proteins and the uniform gold nanoparticle-deposited multi-walled nanotube hybrid (Au-MWNT-HB) films for the detection of C-reactive protein (CRP). Au-MWNT-HB films were used as a good electrochemical transducer due to their excellent electrical properties and large surface areas for the signal transduction, while the genetically engineered fusion proteins, or 6His-GBP-SpA fusion proteins, specifically bind onto the surface of the Au-MWNT-HB films and efficiently immobilize bioreceptors for the detection of CRP. As-obtained biosensor platforms were characterized by electrochemical and optical analysis and revealed better performance compared to conventional Au-based biosensors. The concept delineated herein opens a new insight into nanobiotechnology through the integration of genetically engineered biomaterials with carbon nanotube (CNT)-based nanohybrids for emerging applications.\nSolution chemistry of self-assembled graphene nanohybrids for high-performance flexible biosensors.\nDepartment of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon 305-701, Korea.\nWe report the preparation of free-standing flexible conductive reduced graphene oxide/Nafion (RGON) hybrid films by a solution chemistry that utilizes self-assembly and directional convective-assembly. The hydrophobic backbone of Nafion provided well-defined integrated structures, on micro- and macroscales, for the construction of hybrid materials through self-assembly, while the hydrophilic sulfonate groups enabled highly stable dispersibility ( approximately 0.5 mg/mL) and long-term stability (2 months) for graphene. The geometrically interlocked morphology of RGON produced a high degree of mechanical integrity in the hybrid films, while the interpenetrating network constructed favorable conduction pathways for charge transport. Importantly, the synergistic electrochemical characteristics of RGON were attributed to high conductivity (1176 S/m), facilitated electron transfer (ET), and low interfacial resistance. Consequently, RGON films obtained the excellent figure of merit as electrochemical biosensing platforms for organophosphate (OP) detection, that is, a sensitivity of 10.7 nA/microM, detection limit of 1.37 x 10(-7) M, and response time of <3 s. In addition, the reliability of RGON biosensors was confirmed by a fatigue test of 100 bending cycles. The strategy described here provides insight into the fabrication of graphene and hybrid nanomaterials from a material perspective, as well as the design of biosensor platforms for practical device applications.\nSpectroscopic and computational insight into the intermolecular interactions between Zwitter-type ionic liquids and water molecules.\nDepartment of Chemical Engineering, College of Engineering, Kyung Hee University, 1 Seochong, Giheung, Yongin, Gyeonggi, 446-701, Republic of Korea.\nGeometric and conformational changes of zwitter-type ionic liquids (ZILs) due to hydrogen-bonding interactions with water molecules are investigated by density functional theory (DFT), two-dimensional IR correlation spectroscopy (2D IR COS), and pulsed-gradient spin-echo NMR (PGSE NMR). Simulation results indicate that molecular structures in the optimized states are strongly influenced by hydrogen bonding of water molecules with the sulfonate group or imidazolium and pyrrolidinium rings of 3-(1-methyl-3-imidazolio)propanesulfonate (1) and 3-(1-methyl-1-pyrrolidinio)propanesulfonate (2), respectively. Concentration-dependent 2D IR COS reveals kinetic conformational changes of the two ZIL-H(2)O systems attributable to intermolecular interactions, as well as the interactions of sulfonate groups and imidazolium or pyrrolidinium rings with water molecules. The dramatic changes in the (1)H self-diffusion coefficients elucidate the formation of proton-conduction pathways consisting of ZIL networks. In ZIL domains, protons are transferred by a Grotthuss-type mechanism through formation, breaking, and restructuring of bonds between ZILs and H(2)O, leading to an energetically favorable state. The simulation and experimental investigations delineated herein provide a perspective to understanding the interactions with water from an academic point of view as well as to designing ILs with desired properties from the viewpoint of applications.\nEnergy transfer in ionic-liquid-functionalized inorganic nanorods for highly efficient photocatalytic applications.\nDepartment of Chem. & Biomolecular Eng.

Self-assembled ILs play the role of multifunctional materials in terms of constructing a well-designed nanostructure, controlling the surface chemistry, and triggering the energy transfer of functionalized materials. IL-functionalized beta-FeOOH nanorods show approximately 10-fold higher performances than those of commercial materials due to the synergistic effect of well-defined nanomaterials in diffusion-controlled reactions, specific interactions with target pollutants, and energy transfers in hybrid materials.

Many of these metabolites have been developed into clinically approved antibiotics, anti-parasitic agents and cancer therapeutics. For the past three decades numerous groups have worked to understand the function and structural parameters involved in expanding the metabolic diversity of modular PKSs through in vivo and in vitro approaches. Although some successes have been reported, there continues to be a need to expand our knowledge about the role of individual catalytic domains, protein-protein interactions and substrate selectivity parameters in order to engineer these systems. We have focused on studies of PKSs that generate 12-, 14- and 16-membered macrolactones in order to understand the primary bottlenecks in production of new metabolites using natural and unnatural chain elongation intermediates. A particular focus in these studies has been the PKS terminal thioesterase domain and the determinants that contribute to selectivity and macrolactonization. Recent studies have revealed the ability to maximize efficiency of macrolactone formation by appropriate pairing of a TE domain in an engineered PKS involved in processing of unnatural substrates. We have also significantly expanded our pool of unnatural substrates to assess flexibility of PKSs toward proximal/distal functional group alterations, heteroatom replacements, and odd-numbered chain elongation intermediates. In numerous examples, new 12-, 14- and 16-membered ring macrocycles are generated, and can be further transformed into novel macrolides by glycosylation and late-stage oxidation with heterologous CYP450s. This biocatalytic cascade approach is enabling scalable methods for understanding PKS function, engineering biosynthetic enzymes and obtaining new bioactive molecules for analysis against a range of disease targets.\nWe are also making progress in the realm of structural studies on complete modular PKSs using cryo-electron microscopy. Following our work on the pikromycin PikAIII (module 5) structure determined several years ago, we are gaining new insights from a terminal PKS module that includes KS-AT-KR-ACP-TE domains. These new studies are revealing a more complete understand of the dynamic forms of the mega-synthase, which is being probed by orthogonal analytical approaches to deepen the insights into these amazing molecular machines.\n1979. 03. \u223c 1983. 02: BS/ Department of Chemical Technology, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.\n1983. 03. \u223c 1985. 02: MS/ Department of Chemical Technology, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.\n1987. 08. \u223c 1992. 04: Ph.D./ Department of Biotechnology, Rice University, Houston, USA.\n2003. 10 ~ 2004. 3: Research Associate, Department of Biomolecular Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology.\n2005. 5 ~ 2007. 6: Fellow, Dept. of Bioengineering, University of Washington.\n2007. 6 ~ 2011. 8: Professor, Dept. of Biomedical Sciences, Chonnam National University Medical School.\n2011.9 ~ 2016.8: Associate Professor, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Chonnam National University Medical School.\n2016.9 ~ Present: Professor, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Chonnam National University Medical School.\n1988. 09 ~ 1989. 08 : Post-doctoral Research Staff / Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, U.S.A.\nMyung hoo Kim, Ph.D.\nJong Hun Lee Ph.

Despite numerous studies for decades, the limited sensitivity of conventional biochemical methods essentially requires preprocessing steps and thus has limitations to be used in realistic settings of biological warfare. We present an optical method for rapid and label-free screening of Bacillus anthracis spores through the synergistic application of holographic microscopy and deep learning. A deep convolutional neural network is designed to classify holographic images of unlabeled living cells. After training, the network outperforms previous techniques in all accuracy measures, achieving single-spore sensitivity and subgenus specificity. The unique \u201crepresentation learning\u201d capability of deep learning enables direct training from raw images instead of manually extracted features. The method automatically recognizes key biological traits encoded in the images and exploits them as fingerprints. This remarkable learning ability makes the proposed method readily applicable to classifying various single cells in addition to B. anthracis, as demonstrated for the diagnosis of Listeria monocytogenes, without any modification. We believe that our strategy will make holographic microscopy more accessible to medical doctors and biomedical scientists for easy, rapid, and accurate point-of-care diagnosis of pathogens.\nBacillus anthracis, a gram-positive spore-forming bacterium causing the disease anthrax, is one of the most destructive biological weapons, which is prone to be abused for bioterrorism (1). It is thus crucial to rapidly detect and identify anthrax spores for biodefense (2). Various biological, chemical, and optical fingerprinting methods have been studied to accelerate diagnosis of B. anthracis (3\u20135). Conventional culture-based methods take days and are often inaccurate. Polymerase chain reaction\u2013based methods provide species-level specificity but still take hours and require heavy instrumentation with skilled personnel to operate the system (4). Photoluminescence and surface-enhanced Raman scattering methods take only minutes but require labeling with exogenous agents and cannot discriminate B. anthracis from other Bacillus species that are ubiquitous in nature (5). Most of these methods are limited by detection sensitivities that require minimum sample sizes of at least thousands of bacterial cells; thus, their applications in practical settings such as aerosolized spores require sample amplification processes that significantly limit the detection speed.\nRecent developments of optical methods based on holographic microscopy combined with machine learning, which enables rapid and label-free identification of single cells, can be an important step to address the anthrax issue (6\u201318). These techniques were pioneered by Javidi\u2019s group (6\u201314) and developed further by several groups (15\u201318). Holographic microscopy (19), or quantitative phase imaging (QPI) in a broader sense, measures optical field images (that is, nanometer-scale distortions of wavefronts passing through a sample) using laser-based interferometry. In addition to the amplitude images available from conventional intensity-based microscopy techniques, holographic microscopy quantitatively measures the optical phase delay maps dictated by the refractive index (RI) distribution of a sample (19). Because the endogenous RI distribution in a cell is strongly related to the structural and biochemical characteristics (20) of the target classes (for example, species or cell types), the measured field images of single cells and the corresponding class labels are passed to data-driven machine learning algorithms for systematic discovery of class-specific fingerprints encoded in the images. These approaches can be combined with flow cytometry and/or bioa<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Earlier this month, I participated in the Digital Natives Workshop hosted by KAIST, the MIT of Korea, and attended by researchers from the U.S. and across the Pacific Rim. My talk on adolescence and the science of attention (entitled \u201cThe Kids Are All Right\u201d) has been recorded along with the other presentations and posted on Google Wave by Dave Sonntag, one of the organizers. I also live-blogged at www.hastac.org. After the workshop, we took the three-hour bus trip from Daejeon to Seoul where we had a field day at the Samsung D\u2019Light interactive showcase and then, on Saturday, were part of a Bar Camp at the high-tech Daum University, in a room that came with a slogan: \u201cBeyond Learning.\u201d I\u2019m still pondering that.\nFor the two days after the Bar Camp, I had the pleasure of seeing Seoul \u201ccurated\u201d through the sensibilities of two distinguished multimedia artists, Youngsun Jin and Jayoung Ku. Among Youngsun Jin\u2019s exquisite fresco murals are \u201cEnlightenment,\u201d a collaboration with the late video artist and media philosopher, Nam June Paik. Youngsun Jin is also a distinguished art historian who writes about the use of fresco by contemporary artists. My second guide in Seoul, Jayoung Ku, creates haunting multimedia performance pieces, described by one media theorist as \u201csearching the information-cosmos for Zen.\u201d I could not have had a better immersion into this multi-faceted city.\nOf particular interest to DML Central is the Child Education and Culture Center at the Leeum Museum of Art that we visited together. It, too, is owned by Samsung and like many twenty-first century private art museums, is a modern-day cathedral to art, architecture, and technology. Three major European architects were brought in to design site-specific buildings for the collection. Mario Botta of Switzerland designed a fantastic space winding around a gigantic circular stairwell inspired by the beautiful Korean porcelains housed there. That portion of the museum extends back to twelfth-century terra cotta pieces, and also includes Korean National Treasure Buddhist paintings, bronze sculptures, and jewelry found in ancient tombs. The second museum is an ecologically-inspired fantasy by French architect Jean Nouvel that includes the work of both Korean and international contemporary artists, including a video sequence from the famous \u201cEgg\u201d series by Nam June Paik.\nThe much-decorated Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas designed the Children\u2019s Center. It is dedicated to making art and, architecturally and geographically, is as significant as the other buildings. This isn\u2019t some small kids\u2019 nook in the museum\u2019s basement but is its own full, architecturally brilliant space. Instead of \u201cDo Not Touch\u201d signs, this space invites children of all ages to touch, to join in, making, creating, envisioning. It is about tinkering and \u201cthinkering.\u201d It is utterly fun and completely visionary, and uses both ancient and contemporary multimedia pieces as sources of inspiration for the tinkering.\nI don\u2019t know of any other museum that does such a good job of conjoining ancient and modern, history and making, as one seamless, interactive, interconnected world of creative, playful learning.\nThe space refuses any distinction between art and technology, creativity and science, making beauty and building things, physical activity and mental activity. \u201cJungle gym\u201d-type exploratory equipment to climb on leads to editing suites. Lovely illuminated walls holding rows of film gels invite you to remix images by rearranging, tracing, and painting them over on a plexi-glass light table and then reinserting them into the \u201cuser-generated\u201d installation wall.\nI\u2019m not even sure what \u201cdigital\u201d means in a space where low-tech and high-tech merge, and everything is designed to inspire.\nI particularly appreciate the well-designed conduits between the \u201cart museum\u201d spaces and the \u201cart making\u201d spaces. My favorite is a camera on a tripod in front of a huge backdrop of a Bruegel-like harvest landscape. Anyone can pose there, perform scenes, and \u201cinhabit\u201d the landscape photographically. This landscape has a twist, though. In the contemporary wing of the museum, you see that it\u2019s actually part of a work of art by documentary videographer Yeondoo Jung. In his work, he contests the idea of \u201cmade\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d beauty. Everything in the video is \u201cartificial\u201d and the video, shot in sumptuous Golden Age Hollywood Technicolor, documents workers making the landscape, literally rolling out sod for the soil and so forth.\nAnd that is what we all\u2014kids and adults too\u2014are compelled to do in the children\u2019s building of the Leeum Museum in Seoul. It was fascinating to move from a Digital Natives Workshop at KAIST to a literal workshop designed with \u201cdigital natives\u201d in mind. The Leeum puts the goal of inspiring a new generation to creativity on a par with showcasing the greatest works of ancient and contemporary traditions of art. It insists that a museum\u2019s walls not be confining but liberating, and that the great art we prize and cherish should inspire\u2014and set a child\u2019s imagination free.<|endoftext|>"

Yet, the models\u2019 insufficient generalization remains a challenging problem in the practice of in silico drug discovery. We propose two key strategies to enhance generalization in the DTI model. The first is to predict the atom-atom pairwise interactions via physics-informed equations parameterized with neural networks and provides the total binding affinity of a protein-ligand complex as their sum. We further improved the model generalization by augmenting a broader range of binding poses and ligands to training data. We validated our model, PIGNet, in the comparative assessment of scoring functions (CASF) 2016, demonstrating the outperforming docking and screening powers than previous methods. Our physics-informing strategy also enables the interpretation of predicted affinities by visualizing the contribution of ligand substructures, providing insights for further ligand optimization.\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry.\nFig. 1. Our model architecture. A protein\u2013ligand complex is represented in a graph and adjacency matrices are assigned from the binding structure of the complex. Each node feature is updated through neural networks to carry the information of covalent bonds and intermolecular interactions. Given the distance and final node features of each atom pair, four energy components are calculated from the physics-informed parameterized equations. The total binding affinity is obtained as a sum of pairwise binding affinities, which is a sum of the four energy components divided by an entropy term.\nFig. 2. The training scheme of PIGNet. We use three types of data in model training \u2013 true binding complex, true binder ligand\u2013protein pair in a computer-generated binding pose, and non-binding decoy complex. PIGNet predicts binding free energy for each input. For a true binding complex, the model learns to predict its true binding energy. The model also learns to predict the energy of a computer-generated binding pose complex or a non-binding decoy complex in higher value than the true binding energy and threshold energy, respectively. Finally, PIGNet learns the proper correlation of ligand atom position and binding affinity by minimizing the derivative loss.\nFig. 3. Interpretation of the predicted outcomes. (a) Substructural analysis of ligands for two target proteins. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 1 (PTPN1) and platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH). The blue and red circles indicate common and different substructures, respectively, and the predicted energy contribution (unit: kcal mol\u22121) of each substructure is annotated. The inhibitory constant, Ki, indicates how potent the ligand binds to the target protein. (b) A distance\u2013energy plot of carbon\u2013carbon pairwise van der Waals (vdW) energy components in the test set. The red solid line illustrates the original distance-energy relation without any deviation induced by learnable parameters. The closer the color of a data point to yellow, the larger the number of corresponding carbon\u2013carbon pairs. (c) The average value of the corrected sum of vdW radii,, corresponding to different carbon\u2013carbon pair types. Csp2\u2013Csp2, Csp2\u2013Csp3, and Csp3\u2013Csp3 pairs are compared.

        "passage": "Significance of Soluble CD93 in Type 2 Diabetes as a Biomarker for Diabetic Nephropathy: Integrated Results from Human and Rodent Studies\n\nCluster of differentiation 93 (CD93) is a glycoprotein expressed in activated endothelial cells. The extracellular portion of CD93 can be secreted as a soluble form (sCD93) under inflammatory conditions. As diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a well-known inflammatory disease, we hypothesized that sCD93 would be a new biomarker for DN. We prospectively enrolled 97 patients with type 2 diabetes and evaluated the association between serum sCD93 and DN prevalence. The association between CD93 and development of DN was investigated using human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro and diabetic db/db mice in vivo. Subjects with higher sCD93 levels had a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The sCD93 level was an independent determinant of both the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and the eGFR. The risk of prevalent DN was higher in the high sCD93 group (adjusted odds ratio 7.212, 95% confidence interval 1.244\u201341.796, p = 0.028). In vitro, CD93 was highly expressed in HUVECs and both CD93 expression and secretion were upregulated after lipopolysaccharides (LPS) stimulation. In vivo, peritoneal and urine sCD93 levels and the renal glomerular expression of CD93 were significantly higher in the db/db mice than in the control db/m+ mice. These results suggest the potential of sCD93 as a candidate biomarker associated with DN.\n\n\nIntroduction\nCluster of differentiation 93 (CD93) is a type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein composed of C-type carbohydrate-recognition domains, five epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, and a single transmembrane domain [1]. CD93 is mainly expressed in monocytes and endothelial cells [2]. Although the exact role of CD93 in the body is still largely unknown and currently under investigation, 2 of 13 it is possibly an adhesion molecule [3]. CD93 is also present as a soluble form (sCD93), which is an enzymatically cleaved ectodomain of CD93 [4,5], and the sCD93 level or CD93 polymorphisms have been shown to be associated with various inflammatory diseases, such as cerebral ischemia [6], coronary artery disease [7], systemic sclerosis [8], asthma [9], and nasopharyngeal cancer [10].\nDiabetes is fundamentally an inflammatory disease that leads to chronic vascular complications, such as diabetic nephropathy (DN) [11,12]. DN is defined as increased urinary albumin excretion without any other identifiable renal diseases other than diabetes [13] and is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. There are two clinically available markers that enable the detection of the development and progression of DN: the degree of albuminuria by using the albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) method [14]. Because early detection of DN may enable early intervention to slow or even halt the progression of DN, it is clinically important to develop a sensitive marker for DN [13]. However, even the ACR and the eGFR may not be sensitive enough to enable the detection of all DN.\nIn the present study, we hypothesized that sCD93 would be a biomarker of DN incidence. Our objective was to evaluate whether sCD93 is associated with the development of DN in human subjects and to identify the possible mechanism by using a diabetic rodent model.\n\nHuman Study Design and Population\nSubjects with type 2 diabetes (n = 97) were prospectively enrolled from the diabetes clinic in Gangnam Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea, from May 2012 to April 2014. All subjects gave informed consent and the study was approved by the institutional review board of Gangnam Severance Hospital (No. 3-2012-0030). The inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) over 20 years of age, and (ii) type 2 diabetes based on the 2012 ADA guideline. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) concomitant malignancy; (ii) other inflammatory diseases except for diabetes (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, etc.); (iii) steroid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) users; (iv) acute vascular disease (acute myocardial infarction, stroke, etc.); and (v) abnormal liver function. The prevalence of hypertension or dyslipidemia was defined as subjects with a pre-established diagnosis of hypertension or dyslipidemia or those who were taking anti-hypertensive or anti-lipidemic medication, respectively. Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) included both hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke but not a transient ischemic accident. The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy or neuropathy was identified according to the guidelines of the American Diabetes Association [15]. DN was defined as both an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and an ACR \u2265300 mg/g and was classified according to the degree of the eGFR or the albuminuria.\n\nAnthropometric and Biochemical Measurements\nThe serum was collected and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C. All past medical histories, including diabetic macro-and microvascular complications, were recorded as case reports by a physician. Height and body weight were measured at the time of enrolment. Blood pressure (BP) was measured in a sitting position after \u226515 min of rest. Fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were measured from peripheral venous blood samples using adequate enzymatic methods (an automated chemistry analyzer, Hitachi 7600-120, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) after at least 8 h of fasting. The Friedewald formula was used for calculating the low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels. The ACR was calculated as the random urine albumin divided by the random urine creatinine concentration. The eGFR was calculated using the CKD-EPI equation, which involves the serum creatinine value, gender, and age [14]. To measure the serum sCD93 levels in humans, we used a previously published method for the detection of human sCD93 by sandwich enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) [16,17]. Considering the variance in measurement, a mean of duplicated measurements was used for analysis of serum sCD93. The CD93 human protein, a kind gift from professor Shin E. C. at KAIST, Daejeon, Korea, was used as the standard protein. MAB23791 and AF2379 from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA) were used as capture and detector antibodies, respectively. The mouse sCD93 ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (MCD930, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA).\n\nCell Culture and Animal Experiment\nThe human epithelial cell line (293A), human monocyte cell line (THP-1), and human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased from ATCC. The 293A was cultured in DMEM medium (11995065-065, Gibco TM, Life Technologies Corporation, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin and 100 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin). THP-1 was cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (11875-093, Gibco TM ) supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and antibiotics, and HUVECs were cultured in EGM TM -2 medium (CC-3202, LONZA, Walkersvillie, MD, USA). The 293A and THP-1 were used for comparative analysis of CD93 expression based on the cell type. At passages 3-5, HUVECs were stimulated with 500 ng/mL lipopolysaccharides (LPS, L3024, Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) for the indicated time duration (8,24, and 48 h), and then harvested. The CD93 expression pattern was analyzed using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunoblotting, ELISA, and immunostaining. qRT-PCR was performed as previously described [18]. Total RNA was extracted from each cell using an RNA isolation kit (12204-01, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Vilnius, Lithuania) and reverse transcribed using a cDNA synthesis kit (18080-051, SuperScript\u2122 III First-Strand Synthesis System, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The amount of RNA was analyzed with the designated Taqman primer and probes (TaqMan Assay ID: hCD93; Hs00362607_m1, hGAPDH;Hs02786624_g1, Applied Biosystems TM Foster City, CA, USA). The level of CD93 transcription was presented as the relative value after normalization to GAPDH. All cell experiments were repeated four times. For the animal experiments, db/m+ and db/db mice were purchased (SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) and used at specific ages. The mice were allowed access to water ad libitum and housed in a pathogen-free facility at the Gangnam Severance Biomedical Center. Whole blood was collected from the tail veins, and the serum fraction was centrifuged and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C in a freezer for further processing. Albuminuria and urinary sCD93 levels were measured using ELISA kits (1011, Exocell, Philadelphia, PA, USA for mouse albumin, and MCD930, R&D Systems for mouse sCD93) from the urine collected for 24 h. To analyze the peritoneal cavity fluid, the peritoneum of each mouse was washed by injecting 2 mL PBS into the peritoneal cavity. After undulation for 10 min, peritoneal fluid was recollected as much as possible [19]. After centrifugation, only the fluid fraction was used to measure<|endoftext|>"

Epub 2005 Aug 2.\n1 Department of BioSystems, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), 373-1 Guseong-dong, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 305-701, Korea.\nThis paper presents a novel microfluidic device for dielectrophoretic separation based on a trapezoidal electrode array (TEA). In this method, particles with different dielectric properties are separated by the device composed of the TEA for the dielectrophoretic deflection of particles under negative dielectrophoresis (DEP) and poly(dimethylsiloxane)(PDMS) microfluidic channel with a sinuous and expanded region. Polystyrene microparticles are exposed to an electric field generated from the TEA in the microfluidic channel and are dielectrophoretically focused to make all of them line up to one sidewall. When these particles arrive at the region of another TEA for dielectrophoretic separation, they are separated having different positions along the perpendicular direction to the fluid flow due to their different dielectrophoretic velocities. To evaluate the separation process and performance, both the effect of the flow rate on dielectrophoretic focusing and the influence of the number of trapezoidal electrodes on dielectrophoretic separation are investigated. Now that this method utilizes the TEA as a source of negative DEP, non-specific particle adhering to the electrode surface can be prevented; conventional separation approaches depending on the positive DEP force suffer from this problem. In addition, since various particle types are continuously separated, this method can be easily applicable to the separation and analysis of various dielectric particles with high particle recovery and selectivity.<|endoftext|>"

Fracking is currently being discussed controversially by the different European countries: While France, Bulgaria, and Ireland have banned fracking, Denmark, Poland, and some Eastern states are taking steps to establish the technology in their countries. The chemical industry in Europe sees fracking as a path to economic prosperity. Oil and gas firms insist that fracking can be done safely and with minimal harm to the environment. Frimpong said that they continue to innovate solutions that address concerns of their stakeholders, e.g., by research towards cleaner hydraulic fracking fluids, better monitoring of how fast the oil flows, and by understanding the impact of the fracs and how they can be more effective. He considers that as well heads are below the surface, they reduce visual impact compared to solar and wind power.\nBesides many other activities, Professor Barbara Albert, President of the GDCh, congratulated Felix Kortmann, the winner of the 2013 picture competition \"A Year in the Lab.

Although PAUF possesses various pro-tumorigenic properties, here we are treating PAUF to only DCs and PAUF is washed off before DCs are injected into mice; no PAUF is actually injected into the body. Furthermore, PAUF treatment leads to activation and maturation in DCs, and is unlikely to induce oncogenic properties. Thus, we believe that the PAUF-treated DC vaccine should not carry oncogenic effects. Nevertheless the safety concern should be definitively evaluated in the future.\nUntil now, over 103 adjuvants have been developed and tested in vaccines [17]. The majority of these adjuvants are pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) derived from organic or inorganic compound, or from microorganisms. Here we used PAUF, a protein of human origin, to activate DCs for the first time. The immune stimulating properties of PAUF are very similar to those of damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs). In particular, high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), another ligand for TLR4 and TLR2 with human origin, also activates DCs through a TLR4 dependent manner [18]. Our result serves as a reference for further investigation of using other DAMPs such as HMGB1 to induce activation and maturation in DCs to generate antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Although both PAMPs and DAMPs are danger signals that can activate DCs and other immune cells, their excessive presence may lead to toxicities and adverse effects, such as acute and chronic inflammation ultimately leading to cancer [19]. Future studies should evaluate whether the human origin of PAUF can help minimize the undesirable effects associated with danger signal derived adjuvants.\nThe current study identified PAUF as a novel human-derived adjuvant that can enhance the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell antitumor immunity of DC vaccines, by inducing activation and maturation of DCs and stimulating the innate immunity. PAUF enhanced cancer vaccines may also be used in combination with other therapies, such as using chemotherapies to reduce immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, to further enhance the antitumor effects. In conclusion, PAUF is a novel human based adjuvant with promising translational potential.\n6\u20138 week-old female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Orient.

Cd and Co occurred in very low concentrations (Cd << Co) in all types of land use without any significant variation from one type of land use to another. Ni concentrations were more than those of Co, and the concentrations depended on land use pattern. Average Cr and Cu concentrations were \u2265 100 mg/kg, but Cr had a significantly higher presence in industrial land use. Pb concentrations showed similar trends. The two metals, Mn and Zn, were present in much larger amounts compared to the others with values \u2265 300 mg/kg. Industrial and roadside soil contained much more Mn while commercial soil was enriched with Zn. Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) was used for elucidating the mobility characteristics of the eight heavy metals. Mn suffered the highest leaching from commercial land (9.9 mg/kg on average) and also from other types of land. Co, Cu and Pb showed higher leachability from commercial soils but the leached concentrations were less than those of Mn. The two metals, Zn and Ni, were leached from residential land in considerable amounts. The TCLP showed Mn to be the most leachable metal and Cr the least.\nDepartment of Chemistry, Gauhati University, Guwahati 781014, Assam, India.\nThe determination of the effectiveness of the immobilization of blasting dust (waste generated in galvanic activities) in cement matrix, as well of mechanical, physical and microstructural properties of concrete paving blocks produced with partial replacement of cement was the objective of this work. The results showed that blasting dust has high percentage of silica in the composition and very fine particle size, characteristics that qualify it for replacement of cement in manufacturing concrete blocks. The replacement of Portland cement by up to 5% residues did not cause a significant loss in compressive strength nor increase in water absorption of the blocks. Chemical tests indicated that there is no problem of leaching or solubilization of contaminants to the environment during the useful life of the concrete blocks, since the solidification/stabilization process led to the immobilization of waste in the cement mass. Therefore, the use of blasting dust in the manufacture of concrete paving blocks is promising, thus being not only an alternative for proper disposal of such waste as well as a possibility of saving raw materials used in the construction industry.\nChemical Engeneering Department, State University of Maringa, 5790 Colombo Avenue, City of Maringa, Brazil.\nThe present study has been performed on one year old tree saplings of Azadirachta indica (L.), Cassia siamea (L.), Dalbergia sissoo (Roxb.), Eucalyptus rostrata (L.), Mangifera indica (L.) and Schyzygium cumini (L.) in order to assess the effect of exposure of SO2-NO2, alone and combination of two gases. Tree saplings have been exposed to an average of 495 \u03bcg m-3 SO and 105 \u03bcg m-3 NO2 for 40 d at the rate of 4 h d-1 during 10:00 am to 01:00 pm in OTC. Total chlorophyll, specific leaf area (SLA), nitrate reductase (NR) activity, foliar protein, free proline content and free amino acids (AAs) of foliage have been the plant parameters, taken into consideration to evaluate the effect of gaseous exposure. Exposure of two gases has caused reduction in total chlorophyll content (P < 0.05, 0.01). Physiological and biochemical process has been seemed to be altered noticeable due to the combined effect of SO2 + NO2 followed by SO2 alone (P < 0.05, 0.01). NO2 mediated stress has produced, stimulatory and inhibitory responses in tree saplings. Results reveal that tree saplings have been attempted to absorb the NO2 through N assimilation pathway. E. rostrata, C. siamea have been emerged as moderate tolerant to SO2 mediated stress followed by A. indica. Response pattern of S. cumini, M. indica and D. sissoo set them as good indicators of SO2-NO2 exposure. Effects of two gases on tree saplings have been found to be synergistic.\nInstitute of Environment Management & Plant Sciences, School of Studies in Botany, Vikram University Ujjain 132001, India.\nIn this study, we investigated a life cycle assessment (LCA) of six roof-waterproofing systems [asphalt (C1), synthetic polymer-based sheet (C2), improved asphalt (C3), liquid applied membrane (C4), Metal sheet with asphalt sheet (N1), and liquid applied membrane with asphalt sheet (N2)]for reinforced concrete building using an architectural model. To acquire accurate and realistic LCA results, minimum units of material compositions for life cycle inventory and real data for compositions of waterproofing materials were used. Considering only materials and energy demands for waterproofing systems per square meter, higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could be generated in the order of C1 > N2 > C4 > N1 > C2 > C3 during construction phase. However, the order was changed to C1 > C4 > C3 > N2 > N1 > C2, when the actual architecture model was applied to the roof based on each specifications. When an entire life cycle including construction, maintenance, and deconstruction were considered, the amount of GHG emission was in the order of C4 > C1 > C3 > N2 > C2 > N1. Consequently, N1 was the most environmental-friendly waterproofing system producing the lowest GHG emission.

However, some argue whether this sort of action is a true reflection of grieving. The KAIST\u2008Herald takes a look into both sides of the issue.\nThe past issue of this series dealt with the responsibility of journalists to effectively promote their stories to the target audience. My colleague asserted that the lack of our youth\u2019s intellectual maturity should not only be attributed to the writers who produce shallow and insignificant news but also to those who report meaningful stories with substance but fail to use all the tools at their disposal - visual, promotional, or otherwise - to deliver the necessary information to the intended audience. However, looking back at the poor media coverage of the recent Sewol ferry disaster, I am beginning to think that there is room for one more attributing factor; this factor is about how the content of news should be presented within the context of the story.\nHow sad are you about the capsizing of the Sewol ferry? Far too many seem to have taken the convenient and meaningless route to its mourning. During my visit to the public altars in Daejeon, I realized that on each page of the book filled with visitors\u2019 personal messages consoling the victims, there was always someone saying how they are \u201csorry for not protecting you.\u201d The social norm dictates that all should mourn for such tragedies, but the laziness to do anything meaningful, combined with the unconscious pressure, seems to have brought about a sad form of feigned activism with a greater negative impact than the perceivable shallowness.\nThe sinking of the Sewol ferry on April 16 has caused the entire nation to mourn for the tragic loss of many lives. More than 300 people were found dead or missing, while only 172 people out of 476 passengers were rescued. Immediately after the accident, the government announced that 368 people were rescued. However, it was later found that there was a counting error, and the number was corrected to 164. When it became clear that the remaining passengers were unaccounted for, the public response began to transform from shock to anger.\nFrom March 24 to April 11, Korea Industrial, Technical, & Academic Information Service Co., better known as KITIS, hosted an online event named \u201cIEL Searching Quiz Contest.\u201d The KAIST Herald met with the event supervisor, William Song, to hear his intentions on the quiz contest and the uses of IEL and IEEE programs.\nThis year, Blossom wrote history by enlisting foreigners in the Undergraduate Student Council and creating the Bureau of International Relations. This is the first time in Korean history that a university student council has accepted foreigners. Yernazar Kairat was chosen as the leader of the Bureau of International Affairs. The KAIST Herald sat down with Yernazar for an interview.\nShould clean disciplinary records be required of personnel working in the student government?\nRecently on Ara (the university\u2019s online forum), controversy arose as a member of the KAIST\u2008Central Administration stepped down from his position after being indicted for charges of violence against a fellow student. Should a person\u2019s history be an indicator of future performance or should the present oversee past mistakes? The KAIST Herald presents two perspectives.\nThe past issue of The KAIST Herald kicked off this series of articles on writing and the responsibilities of the writer by addressing the yellow journalism and \u201ckeyboard warriors\u201d that are rampant online. My colleague also aptly pointed out the important role of web portals in shaping the new generation\u2019s worldview, and how most Korean sites fail to promote stories that contribute to our youth\u2019s intellectual maturity. But is the key issue the writers who produce shallow and insensitive material, or the publication of information in a manner that shines the spotlight on matters of little importance? The digital age has permanently changed the manner in which information is created, provided, and received. Visual presentation of information and the platform through which it is propagated has become equally as, if not more important than, whether there was a true wordsmith behind the keyboard that created it.\nI am sure the word \u201crecitation class\u201d is one of the most frequently used terms in KAIST. Recitation session is an unavoidable and a bit stressful part of KAIST life. Hence, there are controversial discussions constantly going on about recitation classes, and each year, the student council comes up with compromising policies due to these complaints.\n2013 was quite the year. KAIST underwent new political figures (KAIST International Students Association President Amalina Wahab, and the Undergraduate Council Blossom), changes in infrastructure (Office of Advising and Supporting for International Students becoming International Scholar and Student Services, Tae Wul Gwan\u2019s (N13)new cafeteria Grillcook), and increased international reputations (influx of exchange of students and higher global university rankings). Though technically three months late, the new year has started, and we can look forward to familiar events like the strawberry parties, the culture festival, summervacation, and new unknowns.\nKAIST Lefthanded is a new student forum that focuses on human rights for minorities, especially sexual, physical, and cultural minorities. They welcome all KAIST students, and is the first forum of its kind at KAIST. The KAIST Herald met with one of its members, Se Won Park, for an interview.\nI am not a journalist but a student (in a field relatively distant from professional writing at that) and little pushes me towards writing artfully or considering the philosophies of writing in the grand scheme of society. However, I have experienced, as probably have my colleagues, that having my name printed on an official news article monthly has affected me in my ways of perceiving our writing in society. Hereon, I wish to write on those initiated thoughts as the start of a series.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "At the present time, the time of progress and new technologies, and the time of revolution in all spheres of our life, the number of different mass media sources available to us is wide and rich. Moreover, the quality of the means of communication is constantly increasing. The use of media among young people is more private and independent. The elder people use the means of communication in order to get some information. It is worth emphasizing the fact that the mass media is one of the leading factors in life of the society, but only in that case, when it brings benefits.\nPeople spend more and more time on surfing the Internet and on using various social networks, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. They communicate with their friends, with strange people, find different information, and share their personal stuff. People prefer reading newspapers and political news in spite that the information is not always reliable, credible, and checked. Surfing the Internet people forget about their everyday duties, friends, families, work, sleeping, and even eating. As a result, they deal with the problem of addiction and depriving of alive communication.\nCommunication is the most important way of arranging relationships between people. It is very important not only in professional life, but in the private one as well. Speaking about the importance of communication for managers, it is necessary to say that they should know the art of communication. Without doubt, communicating effectively shows competence, professionalism, and intelligence of personality.\nHowever, with the development of technologies, the quality of communication between people becomes worse. People spend too much time in Twitter and other social networks. It is difficult to say whether Twitter is social benefit or social disaster.\nBest Buy is the biggest electronics customer store in the United States. It is popular with its gadgets. One may name this company the earliest user of social media. Best Buy struggled for being the first for a long period of time. The company uses social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, for communication with their customers and clients. The customers and clients have possibility to leave their comments, dissatisfaction claims, and recommendations about the gadgets of Best Buy.\nWithout doubt, communication with employees and clients with the help of Twitter has its advantages and drawbacks. There are the different opinions about the influence of Twitter on collaboration of the companies and their clients. Some people share the thought that Twitter makes the affaires of the company more transparent and understandable for the public. However some people suppose this thought to be utopia and a real exaggeration. Twitter cannot be a tool for improving reputation of the company. Twitter cannot solve the real problems; it can only inform about them and attract the interest of public.\nAnalyzing the case \u201cSocial Benefit or Social Disaster?\u201d I came to a conclusion that the top communication issues are misunderstanding between the company and its employees, and negative remarks of the customers that can spoil the reputation of the company. The problem is that the information may not always be reliable, credible, and checked. We always get data about the gadgets and innovations of the company, but sometimes this information may be false.\nNobody denies the fact that mass media plays an important role in life of the modern organizations. The means of communication are known to like to exaggerate some facts in order to make a stir and to attract attention of as more people, as possible. Moreover, mass media should work successfully and give only truthful, credible, as well as checked information, and never make hasty conclusions. The mass media should be not only a resource of information, but also an instructor and adviser. The means of communication take the leading role during all phases of advertising, informing, and satisfying the clients\u2019 needs.\nMany studies prove that messages of the users (for example, clients) are mediated messages; it means that the messages are filtered through other sources, before they reach the public. As we can see, not all messages and opinions of the clients would be available to the general public.\nFacebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, and other social networks are the means of advertisement and presentation of information for the users of these social media and for the potential customers. Social media is the most popular way of information distribution. Even though the social media is the most expensive way of advertising, it is worth of doing this. It is the easiest and the most effective way to reach the customers of all ages. As we can see, in general, social media has a positive trend.\n3.

        "passage": "1,2, \u2026, K, is selected to process the collected sensing results from all SUs in the same cluster.\nFor sensing duration, first, each SU calculates the energy of its received signal in the frequency band of interest. Local decisions are then transmitted to the corresponding CH through a control channel, which will combine local decisions to make a cluster decision. Secondly, all cluster decisions will be forwarded to the FC through a control channel. At the FC, all cluster decisions from the CHs will be combined to make a global decision about the presence or absence of the PU signal.\nThe energy detection method has been demonstrated to be simple, quick and able to detect primary signals, even if prior knowledge of the signal is unknown [19 - 22]. A block diagram of the energy detection method in the time domain is shown in Fig. 2. To measure the energy of the signal in the frequency band of interest, a band-pass filter is first applied to the received signal, which is then converted into discrete samples with an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter.\nrepresent the mean and variance for hypothesis H 1.\nwhich denotes that index of SU, to simplify the notation.\nFor the BPSK signal [24], then we set M = 4.By substituting the value M = 4 in Eq. (8).\nThen, we can have distributions of a decision statistic under null and alternative hypotheses as in Eq. (5).\nThe last equality is obtained by using Eq. (5).\nWith Eqs. (15) and (16), the probabilities of false alarm and detection for PU signal can be calculated when the duration of sensing time Ts is given.\nA general frame structure for conventional cluster-based cooperative spectrum sensing is shown in Fig. 3. With this frame structure, all local decisions are forwarded to the CHs in the scheduled SU reporting time slots and are then forwarded to the FC in the scheduled CH reporting time slots.\nProof: We focus on the BPSK signal and CSCG noise. The probability of detection can be obtained with Eq. (18) by using the Eq. (17).\nwe can meet the requirement on false alarm and detection probabilities.\nthe sensing performance, i.e., false alarm and detection probabilities depend on SNR of a SU. Therefore, sensing performance is not improved with a fixed sensing time slot. In addition, the reporting time slot for the SU and the CH are not utilized.\nIn the conventional approach, sensing time slots, reporting time slots of SUs, and reporting time slots of CHs are strictly devided as shown in Fig. 3. Due to this rigid structure in the conventionanl approach, the reporting time slots of other SUs and CHs are not used for spectrum sensing. However, these reporting time slots can be used in sensing the specturm by other SUs by scheduling sensing and reporting time slots effectively. To this end, a super-allocation and cluster-based cooperative spectrum sensing scheme is proposed by increasing the sensing time slot. In the proposed scheme, each SU can obtain longer sensing time slot because the other SU reporting times and the CH reporting times are merged to the SU sensing time. Therefore, the sensing time slots for SUs in the proposed scheme can be logner than those in the conventional scheme.\nfor j =1,2,3,......, Nc.\nis the duration of the reporting time slot of a CH. Therefore, we can obtain longer sensing time as an index of CH increases.\nin Eq. (23) to sense the PU\u2019s signal. Therefore, sensing performance is improved over the conventional scheme.\ndenote the probability of detection for the conventional and proposed schemes, rspectively. When SU belongs to the first cluster, the CH reporting time slot is not included in its sesing time.\nwhere \u03be is the threshold for the cluster decision.\nwhere \u03c4 is the threshold for the global decision.\nThe number of SUs is 12.\nThe number of clusters is 3.\nThe number of SUs in each cluster is 4.\nThe durations of sensing, SU reproting, and CH reporting time slots are 1ms.\nAverage SNR of each SU in a cluster is -17 dB.\nThe PU signal is a BPSK signal.\nThe noise in SUs is CSCG.\nThe number of samples is 300.\nFirst, the sensing performance of the proposed and conventional cluster-based schemes, in terms of receiver operating characteristic (ROC), were evaluated under a CSCG channel. In this simulation, each SU conducts local sensing using equal gain combining (EGC).\nFig. 5 and Fig. 6, repsectively show ROC curves for the proposed cluster-based schemes, without and with cluster reporting time (RT). The proposed scheme outperforms in detection of the PU, compared with the conventional scheme bacause the proposed super-allocation can have longer sensing time the conventional one. Test statistics Eq. (25) was considered for the proposed scheme without reporting time for the cluster decision. Also, test statistics Eq. (27) was considered for the proposed scheme with reporting time for the cluster decision. When the index of the cluster increases from one to three, the detection probability is increased.\nFrom the detection efficiency of cooperative spectrum sensing, the probability of detection is 0.8, and the probability of false alarm is 0.2. However, in the worst environment, we need the probability of detection to be more than 0.9 and the probability of false alarm to be less than 0.1. In the conventional scheme, we can achieve these sensing performance with a longer sensing time slotm but the throughput of the cognitive radio network decreases. In the proposed scheme, we can easily achieve more than 0.9 and less than 0.1 for the probabilities of detection and false alarm, respectively, because SU reporting time and CH reporting time merge to sense the PU signal without decreasing system throughput.\nFig. 7 and Fig. 8, respectively, show ROC curves for the global decision at the FC for the proposed and conventional cluster-based schemes with and without cluster reporting time. The figures show that an OR-rule-based [25] proposed scheme can achieve the most reliable performance, with and without cluster RT, as well. Therefore, the OR-rule offers the best performances, compared with other fusion decisions (Majority-rule, AND-rule) [25]. As we can expect, the detection performance of the proposed scheme with cluster RT in Fig. 8 is better than the proposed scheme without cluster RT in Fig. 7.\nThe ROC curves of the proposed scheme with cluster reporting time versus the conventional scheme are shown in Fig. 10. From Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, it is shown that the probability of detection in the proposed scheme with cluster reporting time is better than the proposed scheme without cluster reporting time.\nIn Tables 1 and 2, the exact values of detection probabilities in the proposed and conventional approaches are shown. The gain of sensing performance can be verified with the results. For example, the proposed method with a cluster reporting time can detect the spectrum with nearly 100% detection probability whereas the conventional one detects the PU\u2019s signal with 78% of detection probability in -10 dB SNR.\nProbability of detection (PD) without cluster reporting time under SNR vs. number of clusters.\nProbability of detection (PD) with cluster reporting time under SNR vs. number of clusters.\nIn this paper, we propose super-allocation and cluster-based cooperative spectrum sensing in a CR network. The proposed scheme can achieve better sensing performance in comparison with the conventional cluster-based cooperative spectrum sensing scheme. By re-scheduling the reporting time solts of SUs and CHs, a longer sensing durations are guranteed for SUs depending on the order of reporting times of SU and CH. With simulations, the gain of performance is verified.\nMd. Sipon Miah was born in Gaibandha, Bangladesh.

Primary cilia are sensory organelles synthesized by intraflagellar transport (IFT)-A and B complexes, which traffic protein cargo along a microtubular core. We have reported that the deletion of the IFT-A gene,, together with a null allele of its paralog, causes a small skeleton with a small mandible or micrognathia in juvenile mice.

At postnatal day 14, triple allele mutant mice exhibited micrognathia, midface hypoplasia, and a decreased facial angle due to shortened upper jaw length, premaxilla, and nasal bones, reflecting altered development of facial anterior-posterior elements. Mutant mice also showed increased palatal width, while other aspects of the facial transverse, as well as vertical dimensions, remained intact. As such, other ciliopathy-related craniofacial defects, such as cleft lip and/or palate, hypo-/hypertelorism, broad nasal bridge, craniosynostosis, and facial asymmetry, were not observed.

Sixteen judges, including top automotive journalists from 11 countries, selected Hyundai Motor\u2019s submissions from a total of 71 concepts that have debuted at international motor shows for consideration in three categories: Private, Public & Commercial, and Personal. The judges lauded Hyundai Motor\u2019s concepts for introducing innovative transport technologies and services for the future of mobility.\nHDC-6 NEPTUNE, which debuted at the North American Commercial Vehicle Show last November, took inspiration from the iconic Art Deco streamliner railway trains of the 1930s. The concept embodies Hyundai Motor\u2019s vision for a zero-carbon emission future as the company leads a paradigm shift to eco-friendly commercial vehicles. As the demand for zero-carbon and eco-friendly commercial vehicles is expected to increase gradually, FMOTY judges showed support for the first concept vehicle to incorporate hydrogen fuel cell power into commercial delivery.\nThe built-in e-scooter, which debuted as a prototype at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in 2017, is currently being considered as an option for future vehicles. As its name suggests, the electric scooter will be integrated into vehicles, charging itself while the car is operating to provide the last-mile mobility \u2013 a feature the judges regarded highly in addition to its great build quality.\nThis year\u2019s FMOTY ceremony took place today at the KAIST Academic Cultural Complex in Daejeon, attended by SangYup Lee, Senior Vice President and head of the Hyundai Global Design Center; Hak Soo Ha, Design Director at Hyundai Motor Group; and Dong Jin Hyun, Head of Robotics Lab at Hyundai Motor Group.\nLast December, Hyundai Motor unveiled its \u2018Strategy 2025\u2019 roadmap, under which the company will develop Smart Mobility Devices and Smart Mobility Services as the twin core pillars of its business.

Images were acquired on an EVOS FL cell imaging system (Invitrogen) with a EVOS AMEP 4624 (Plan Fluor \u00d7 20/0.45) objective lens.\nAnimal care and handling were performed according to the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST, Daejeon, Korea). Loxp-stop-loxp-eNpHR3.0-EYFP transgenic mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were generated by mating heterozygous transgenic and wild-type mice (Males, 22 weeks, C57BL/6J background) in a specific-pathogen-free environment. All mice were maintained on a 12/12-h light/dark cycle (light cycle beginning at 6:00) at a temperature of 23\u2009\u00b0C. Food and water were supplied ad libitum.\nAll mice were anaesthetized with avertin (20\u2009mg\u2009ml\u22121 of tribromoethanol, 20\u2009\u03bcl\u2009g\u22121 intraperitoneal, Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI, USA) and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA). All injections were delivered at a rate of 0.3\u20130.8\u2009\u03bcl\u2009min\u22121 via a 10-\u03bcl Hamilton syringe (Hamilton Co., Reno, NV, USA) and an injection needle (33-gauge NanoFil Needle Assortment, blunt; WPI, Worcester, MA USA) using a syringe pump (KD Scientific, Holliston, MA, USA). For expression of eNpHR3.0-EYFP, control EXPLORs and Cre:EXPLORs were prepared. In total, 500\u2009\u03bcg of EXPLORs were injected into the ventrolateral part of the brain in each mouse (\u22122.8\u2009mm anteroposterior, \u22122.2 mediolateral and 3.8 dorsoventral). At 5 days after transfection, mice were killed for visualization.\nMice were deeply anaesthetized with avertin (20\u2009mg\u2009ml\u22121 of tribromoethanol, 20\u2009\u03bcl g\u22121 intraperitoneal, Sigma-Aldrich) and perfused first with heparin and then with 4% formaldehyde diluted in PBS. Brains were removed and post-fixed overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Coronal sections (40-\u03bcm thick) were acquired using a vibratome (Leica VT1000S; Leica, Rockleigh, NJ, USA) and collected in PBS. Slices were mounted on glass slides with Vectashield mounting medium containing 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Labs, Peterborough, UK). Fluorescent images (low magnification) were acquired with an Axio Imager 2 fluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss). Confocal images were acquired with a LSM780 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat \u00d7 20/0.8 M27 objective. Brain sections were incubated in PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30\u2009min at room temperature. After washing in PBS for 10\u2009min, sections were incubated in a blocking solution composed of 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.25% Triton-X 100 for 1\u2009h at room temperature. For NeuN/GFAP immunostaining, sections were incubated with mouse anti-NeuN primary antibody (MAB377; Millipore) and chicken anti-GFAP primary antibody (AB5541; Millipore), diluted 1:1,000 in PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100, for 15\u2009h at room temperature. After washing twice in PBS for 5\u2009min each, sections were incubated with fluorescein Alexa 647-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) and Alexa 555-conjugated anti-chicken IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and diluted 1:300 in PBST for 1\u2009h at room temperature.

Epub 2016 Jun 3.\nDepartment of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (BK21+ Program), KAIST, Daejeon, 305-701, South Korea.\nColloidal photonic crystals possess inimitable optical properties of iridescent structural colors and unique spectral shape, which render them useful for security materials. This work reports a novel method to encrypt graphical and spectral codes in polymeric inverse opals to provide advanced security. To accomplish this, this study prepares lithographically featured micropatterns on the top surface of hydrophobic inverse opals, which serve as shadow masks against the surface modification of air cavities to achieve hydrophilicity. The resultant inverse opals allow rapid infiltration of aqueous solution into the hydrophilic cavities while retaining air in the hydrophobic cavities. Therefore, the structural color of inverse opals is regioselectively red-shifted, disclosing the encrypted graphical codes. The decoded inverse opals also deliver unique reflectance spectral codes originated from two distinct regions. The combinatorial code composed of graphical and optical codes is revealed only when the aqueous solution agreed in advance is used for decoding. In addition, the encrypted inverse opals are chemically stable, providing invariant codes with high reproducibility. In addition, high mechanical stability enables the transfer of the films onto any surfaces. This novel encryption technology will provide a new opportunity in a wide range of security applications.\nOpal-based terahertz optical elements fabricated by self-assembly of porous SiO nanoparticles.\nConformal Macroporous Inverse Opal Oxynitride-Based Photoanode for Robust Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting.\nJ Am Chem Soc 2021 May 7;143(19):7402-7413.

        "passage": ", Daejeon established the World Technopolis Association in 1998 with the view of realizing regional development through international cooperation with world science cities. The WTA has grown to have 67 members from 32 countries, human beings first settled in the Daejeon region during the Stone Age. During the Joseon Kingdom period, it remained occupied by the Hoideok-hyeon and Jinjam-hyeon of Gongju Mokha, in 1895, most of the area was made part of Hoideok-gun and Jinjam-gun, excluding some parts that belonged to Gongju-gun. The Daejeon area was known as Hanbat, a native Korean term for large field. Daejeon simply means the thing in Hanja. Historically, Daejeon was a village without many residents. However, in 1905, the Gyeongbu Railway began operations from Seoul to Busan, in 1926 under the rule of the Japanese government, the Honam Railway was built between Mokpo and Daejeon, transforming the latter into a major transportation hub. Because of its location and proximity to means of transportation, Daejeon grew quickly, in 1932, the capital of Chungnam province was moved from Gongju to Daejeon.\nThe Shinkansen is a network of high-speed railway lines in Japan operated by five Japan Railways Group companies. The nickname bullet train is used in English for these high-speed trains. The maximum operating speed is 320 km/h, test runs have reached 443 km/h for conventional rail in 1996, and up to a world record 603 km/h for maglev trains in April 2015. Shinkansen literally means new trunk line, referring to the rail line network. The name Superexpress, initially used for Hikari trains, was retired in 1972 but is used in English-language announcements. The original T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen, connecting the largest cities of Tokyo, carrying 151 million passengers per year, and at over 5 billion total passengers it has transported more passengers than any other high-speed line in the world. The service on the line operates much larger trains and at higher frequency than most other high speed lines in the world. At peak times, the line carries up to thirteen trains per hour in direction with sixteen cars each with a minimum headway of three minutes between trains.\nWhile the Shinkansen network has been expanding, Japans declining population is expected to cause ridership to decline over time, the recent expansion in tourism has boosted ridership marginally. Japan was the first country to build dedicated railway lines for high-speed travel, because of the mountainous terrain, the existing network consisted of 1,067 mm narrow-gauge lines, which generally took indirect routes and could not be adapted to higher speeds. Consequently, Japan had a greater need for new high-speed lines than countries where the standard gauge or broad gauge rail system had more upgrade potential. Other significant people responsible for its development were Tadanao Miki, Tadashi Matsudaira. They were responsible for much of the development of the first line. All three had worked on aircraft design during World War II, the popular English name bullet train is a literal translation of the Japanese term dangan ressha, a nickname given to the project while it was initially being discussed in the 1930s.\nKAIST is a public research university located in Daedeok Innopolis, South Korea. KAIST was established by the Korean government with the help of American policymakers in 1971 as the nations first research oriented science, KAIST has been internationally accredited in business education. KAIST has approximately 10,200 full-time students and 1,140 faculty researchers and had a budget of US$765 million in 2013. From 1980 to 2008, the institute was known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science, in 2008, the name was shortened to KAIST. The institutes academic scheme was designed by Frederick E. Terman, vice president of Stanford University, and Chung Geum-mo. The institutes two main functions were to train advanced scientists and engineers and develop a structure of education in the country. Research studies began by 1973 and undergraduates studied for bachelors degrees by 1984, in 1981 the government merged the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and the Korean Institute of Science and Technology to form the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, or KAIST.\nDue to differing research philosophies, KIST and KAIST split in 1989, in the same year KAIST and the Korea Institute of Technology combined and moved from Seoul to the Daedeok Science Town in Daejeon. The first act of President Suh upon his inauguration in July 2006 was to lay out the KAIST Development Plan, the \u2018KAIST Development Five-Year Plan\u2019 was finalized on February 5,2007 by KAIST Steering Committee. The goals of KAIST set by Suh were to one of the best science and technology universities in the world. In January 2008, the university dropped its name, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. It is Korea\u2019s first test-free admissions system, full scholarships are given to all students including international students in the bachelor and doctorate courses. Doctoral students are given military-exemption benefits, in addition, many courses are provided in English. According to JoongAng Daily National Rankings, more than 80% of major courses taught at KAIST are conducted in English, governed by a special law, the university has an autonomous and flexible academic system.\nThe elected host city was announced on 6 July 2011 by the International Olympic Committee, after the 123rd IOC Session in Durban, South Africa. Other candidates that applied to host the games were Annecy and Munich, Pyeongchang won on its third consecutive bid, having lost previously to Vancouver in Canada and Sochi in Russia. It will be the first Winter Olympic Games and second Olympic Games in South Korea, Pyeongchang will be the third East Asian city to host the Winter Games after Sapporo and Nagano, and the first Winter Games in Continental Asia. Pyeongchang launched bids to host both the 2010 and 2014 Winter Olympic Games, despite having the most votes in the first round of voting, Pyeongchang lost in the final round of voting by three and four votes respectively. It finally won its bid for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in the first round of voting and they received 63 of the 95 votes cast, giving them the required majority to be elected as host city. Munich launched a bid to host these Games, Annecy launched a bid, but failed to secure public support from local citizens.\nTheir bid ultimately just received seven votes, forty-eight votes were needed for selection. The ticket prices for the 2018 Winter Olympics were announced in April 2016 and went on sale in October 2016, tickets for the opening and closing ceremonies will range from \u20a9220,000 to \u20a91.5 million. By contrast, figure skating and the Mens hockey gold medal game have are carry the most expensive tickets of the Games, on 5 August 2011, the International Olympic Committee announced the formation of the Pyeongchang 2018 Coordination Commission. On 4 October 2011, it was announced that the Organizing Committee for the 2018 Winter Olympics will be headed by Kim Jin-sun, the Pyeongchang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic & Paralympic Winter Games was launched at its inaugural assembly on 19 October 2011. The first tasks of the committee was to put together a master plan for the games as well as forming a design for the venues. The IOC Coordination Commission for the 2018 Winter Olympics made their first visit to Pyeongchang in March 2012, by then, construction was already underway on the Olympic Village.\nThe Gyeongbu Line is the most important railway line in South Korea and one of the oldest. Constructed in 1905, connecting Seoul to Suwon, Daegu, the Gyeongbu Line is by far the most heavily travelled rail line in South Korea. High-speed, express and freight trains provide frequent service along its entire length, the Gyeongbu Line was originally constructed as a vehicle of colonialism. In 1894-1895, Imperial Japan and Qing Dynasty China fought the First Sino-Japanese War for influence over Korea. Following the war, in competition with Russias rail expansion across China, Japan sought the right from the Korean Empire to build a railway from Busan to Seoul, the Gyeonbu Line. Surveying began in 1896, and in spite of local protests, construction of the Gyeongbu Line started on August 20,1901, with a ceremony at Yeongdeungpo, Seoul. Construction was done by locals commanded to do forced labour, Japan sought to gain control of the Gyeongui Line project that was to continue tracks further north, recognising the trunk route as a means to keep Korea under its influence.\nThe line was advanced for military considerations in expectation of a confrontation with Russia. Troop bases were established in connection with the railway, the biggest of them next to Yongsan Station in Seoul, construction of the Gyeongbu Line was completed on January 1,1905. The first trains travelled the line in 17 hours 4 minutes, by April 1906, travel time was reduced to 11 hours, while top speed was 60 km/h. The line developed into the backbone of transport in Korea under Japanese rule, following the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, from April 1,1933, the line was traversed by direct trains from Busan to Andong across the border. Travel times increased greatly while the line was used for transport in World War II, following World War II, the Seoul\u2013Busan express train re-established on May 20,1946, was named Chosun Liberator. During the Korean War, the line transported<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Olympic torch processionals are ceremonies filled with prestige. Typically, a country's leaders, celebrities, national heroes and community members come together to run the torch from city to city before reaching its final destination. This year's torch passing for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea got quite the unprecedented addition -- a robot. But for South Koreans (and fans of robotics), this wasn't just any robot. This robot was Hubo.\nHubo symbolically passed the torch in front of the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in Daejeon. KAIST researchers brought Hubo to life in 2005 under the expertise of Professor Oh Jun-ho. In 2015, the KAIST team brought home a $2 million USD prize in robotics in a contest held by a Pentagon research agency. The key to the team's success? Hubo and his family of humanoid rescue robots.\nIn a world of increasingly terrifying robots that could take over the world (looking at you, Sophia), Hubo's display at the Winter Olympics torch transfer was a breath of fresh air.\nHubo walks toward a brick wall emblazoned with the Winter Olympic torch relay logo on it. Hubo takes the torch from Professor Dennis Hong who was the founding director of the Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory at UCLA. Hubo then gives Hong a ride to the torch passing location.\nBut wait! An obstacle 'blocks' the path. Hubo, a robot designed for rescue operations, is clearly prepared. He takes the flame from Hong, walking slowly toward the wall and only stumbling a few times. Hubo then drills into the wall and passes the torch to his 'father' Professor Oh Jun-ho.\nBut the endearing awkwardness did not stop there. Professor Oh then presented the flame to a young aspiring scientist sitting in KAIST's latest robot. The FX-2 robot is entirely human-operated and massive when compared to Hubo's size and stature. The FX-2 weighs over 600 lbs (272.2 kg) and stands at over 8 ft tall (2.4 m). Hubo is just 47 inches tall and can walk 65 paces per minute.\nHubo only traveled about 500 feet (roughly 150 meters) with the torch, but he didn't have to go far to make a statement about the advancement of South Korea's robotics programs. Pyeongchang 2018 Organizing Committee President Lee Hee-beom called the stunt a \"display of innovation and creativity.\"\nHubo is actually one of 85 robotics assistants that will appear throughout the 2018 Winter Games, according to news outlet Yonhap which helped unveil the decision earlier this month. The robots will vary in abilities, functions and programming, Yonhap reported.\n\"Speaking robots will provide information on event scheduling, places to go sightseeing and transportation in four languages -- Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese -- and paint robots will draw murals on the walls of stadiums during the games, [the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy] said,\" Yonhap noted in their report.\nThe man responsible for orchestrating and developing these 85 robots for the Olympics? Hubo creator Oh Jun-ho.\nWatch the video: RSS Conference - June 28, 2018 - Keynote - Jun Ho Oh (May 2021).<|endoftext|>"

KAIST was formed when the Korean government partnered with the United States with the goal of creating a research oriented school that was mainly focused on science and technology. As KAIST is mainly a research school, it has developed over 2,500 domestic patents and over 700 international patents since its inception. KAIST has also developed a business school as part of its expansion over the years. It was formerly named Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, but was shortened to just KAIST in 2008. KAIST has two campuses \u2013 in Daejeon and Seoul. The Daejeon campus is the main campus and is about 150 kilometers south of Seoul.\nKaist is a world-class university, with Times Higher Education World University Rankings putting them at the 102nd best university in the world. Thomson Reuters named KAIST the sixth most innovative university in the world and most innovative in the Asia Pacific region in 2016 and 2017. These rankings are extremely impressive for a university that is less than 50 years old. KAIST offers bachelors, masters, and doctorate programs. The vast majority of courses are taught in English.\nOver 10,000 full time students attend KAIST (about half of whom are undergraduate students and the other half split between masters and doctorate students). KAIST also boasts a thriving international student program, with students attending from over 70 countries throughout the world making KAIST incredibly diverse. KAIST has 6 colleges, 2 schools and 33 departments, making it likely that they offer a program suitable for most students (although their specialty is still technology and science). The Daejeon campus has 29 dorms for students \u2013 23 for males, 4 for females, and 2 for married students. The Seoul campus is home to the business school and graduate schools of finance, management, and information and media management.\nKAIST has over 50,000 alumni and a number of them have gone on to very successful and accomplished careers. Yi So-yeon, the first Korean to fly in space, has received numerous degrees from KAIST. Other notable alumni include Tony Kim (founder of ProtoPie), San Soo Oh (founder of the world\u2019s first internet phone, DialPad), and Bum-chun Lee (founder of QNIX). KAIST also helped several musicians and K-Pop stars get their education, including Kim So-jung, Lee Jang-won (Peppertones), and Shin Jae-pyung (Peppertones). Also the actress Yoon So-hee studied engineering at KAIST.\nKAIST offers a lot of different scholarship programs to help students with the cost of attendance. KAIST partners with a few universities throughout the world to offer a dual degree program, including Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh, PA, USA), Georgia Institute of Technology (Atlanta, GA, USA), Technical University of Denmark (Kongens Lyngby, Denmark), Technical University of Berlin (Berlin, Germany), and Technical University of Munich (Munich, Germany). The library at KAIST recently was remodeled and expanded in 2018 to include conference rooms and media rooms.\nKAIST is not easy to get into, with a low acceptance rate. Although the specifics is not known, it is estimated that the KAIST acceptance rate is below 20%. The university is popular among international students because it guarantees that every international students get scholarships. If you want more information about that, visit KAIST Scholarships Page. So, in order to get accepted, you need to be a very qualified student.\nI hope that this article about KAIST acceptance rate was useful.

The VO2 nanowires were prepared using the chemical vapor deposition method with V2O5 powder on silicon substrates at 850 \u00b0C. Hydrogenation was carried out using the high-pressure hydrogenation method. Raman spectroscopy confirmed that the incorporated hydrogen atoms resulted in a change in the lattice constant of the VO2 nanowires (NWs). To quantitatively measure the work function of the nanowires, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was employed at ambient conditions. We found that the work function decreased with increasing H2 pressure, which also resulted in increased conductance. This is associated with hydrogen diffused into the VO2 that acts as a donor to elevate the Fermi level, which was also confirmed by KPFM. From these results, tuning of the reversible electrical properties of VO2 NWs, including the conductance and work function, can be achieved by incorporating hydrogen at relatively moderate temperatures.<|endoftext|>"
