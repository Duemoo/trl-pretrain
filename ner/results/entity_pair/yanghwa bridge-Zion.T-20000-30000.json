Season 5 had some serious competition and although it didn\u2019t have the idol backing like the previous season, the popularity has been no joke. The Show Me The Money Concert Tour made a stop in Chicago and Los Angeles and was nothing short of AMAZING.\nEntering the Rosemont Theatre in Chicago, baseball caps filled the crowd at the 4,400 seated venue. Screams filled the room as promos for Crush\u2019s First Solo Tour teased the crowd as they anticipated the start of the show.\nAlthough Rosemont Theatre is all seated, everyone rose from their seats as soon as the concert started. SMTM riled up the crowd with an ode to old school hip-hop in a video graphic that featured New York-style graffiti and B-boying.\nThe crowd was already hyped but then Gil entered and accompanied Mad Clown in performing their special stage and the room filled with roars.\nAlthough Team Gil & Mad Clown were known for their awkward interactions this season, all of that was gone when they performed. Another video teaser started, and it became obvious that the teams would continue to perform in order of elimination from the show. That\u2019s when The Quiett entered the room. The crowd went wild as Illionaire has been quite popular in the U.S. for the past few years with their simple concept of providing no frills, hard hitting hip hop.\nIllionaire symbols filled the room and stayed up for Illionaire\u2019s full set of nine songs. Dok2 came on during the second song, \u201cBeverly Ills,\u201d which was obviously one of the crowd favorites.\nAlthough Dok2 and The Quiett had a longer set than most of the other performers, they kept their energy up and delivered their rhymes flawlessly. With their last song \u201c\uc5f0\uacb0\uace0\ub9ac (YGGR),\u201d they continuously built up the chorus which hyped up the crowd so much that the room was going insane! Thousands of voices repeated the lyrics until the duo left the stage.\nHe introduced his hit \u201cBeautiful\u201d by saying, \u201cDon\u2019t call me handsome boy, I\u2019m beautiful motherf**ker!\u201d and continued to do a four-song set.\nThe concert had been filled with hard hip-hop sounds all night and that\u2019s when Zion.T graced the stage with his soulful voice and popular song \u201c\ucff5 (Koong).\u201d The crowd went crazy as Zion.T hinted towards his three next songs and crowd kept guessing them right. Kush and C Jamm came back on for the SMTM hit \u201c Machine Gun\u201d before Zion. T finished with \u201cYanghwa Bridge.\u201d Of course Zion.T couldn\u2019t exit the stage without his signature bow.\nThe crowd had been anticipating the final team, AOMG, and when Gray hit the stage teasing the ladies with his \u201cSINGLE\u201d shirt and the whole room filled with screams. He performed \u201cDream Chaser\u201d and \u201cJust Do It\u201d solo before Simon D came on the stage.\nIt was obvious that Simon D was truly enjoying himself as he spoke English with the crowd. \u201cMusic is the one. Simon Dominic is the one.\u201d \u201cSimon Dominic is yours!\u201d and even made a fangirl\u2019s dream come true as he responded to her \u201cI love you\u201d with<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "nae here offers a whole song himself making his passion for music known by his voice. You can feel his emotions while singing and its pretty much one of the best covers he have so far (in my preference).\nJungkook with Rap Monster (back then) released a pre-debut cover in 2012 of the song \"Like A Star\" by J.Cole. Hearing a young Jeongguk singing along in English with Namjoon here rapping sounds so nostalgic and impressive at the same time. With such an arrangement and sampling, in an early age, these two have already proven how talented they were - with so much potential and skills.\nDecember 29, 2015 - SoundCloud upload here. What I love about their collaboration is that they compliment each other's vocal ranges. Troye Sivan's song not only showcased Jungkook's versatility but as well as RM potential in singing and that he can deliver it clean and amazingly good.\nDecember 25, 2014 - A rendition of Justin Bieber's Mistletoe which lyrics were written and changed by Jimin himself. This is a pretty sweet and lovely carol from the two vocalists of the group. I find it impressive that Jungkook's voice can be this cute, relax and the whole change on the arrangement of the song despite sounds nice. It brings me back some childhood memories whenever I hear their giggling laugh at the end.\nYOU'RE MY with the full Vocal Line Jimin, Jin and V from original song of BIGBANG Taeyang.\nJeon Jungkook as BTS Main Vocalist and youngest member has participated the MBC Entertainment's THE KING OF MASK SINGER episode 71 last August 7, 2016 while singing to BIGBANG's \"If You\" and his beautiful live performance took over the crowd by a surprise. His interpretation of the song is amazing! I mean, he can even steal million of hearts just by his sweet voice even, to be very honest. On this link he was identified as the Golden Maknae.\nFrom the same episode of \"The King of Mask Singer\" Jungkook also sung with Lady Jane as Archery Girl. Their collaboration or rather 1on1 round was pretty impressive, hearing its studio version sounds beautiful and romantic. I'd be glad to hear him sing with other artists more, may it be female idols, I won't mind.\nAn original tweet from BTS Twitter page last September 24, 2014 was Jungkook's full recording or song cover or Zion.T's Yanghwa Bridge click here for the SoundCloud upload.\nOne year after, KBS World have Jungkook performed with Zion.T himself during the 2015 KBS Song Festival (held on Jan 23, 2016). It's a dream come true for the young artist to be able to collaborate with his sunbaenim/idol for such a beautiful and meaningful song on stage.\nYB - A Flying Butterfly stage by 20-year-old idols participated by Jungkook with his fellow K-artists of the same line in the industry (during 2016 KBS Song Festival). What I love on this stage? Well, BTS Maknae slays! His amazing intro brought a great impression of the whole show/presentation and successful!\nBTS members here on their bad boy vibes dancing along with Jungkook on his vocal cover of Rainism (Rain) as they performed old kpop songs. I just feel like including this on this blog as the last from the list because he technically brought them all powerfully. His breakdance was a definition of smooth, sexy and strong in combo. Center Jungkook definitely owned their stage in MMF2016!\n\u2022 Marry Me Jungkook here singing Jason Derulo's Marry Me on his own version from a clip/episode of American Hustle Life.\n\u2022 Dear No One during a Vlive broadcast with Taehyung.\n\u2022 See You Again Jungkook singing to Wiz Khalifa's in a video tweet.\n\u2022 Half Moon from a solo vlive broadcast clip where he was singing while on sound trip.\n\u2022 Contrail another beautiful song from Moon Moon which he sung during a live broadcast.\n\u2022 Boyfriend in a guesting for AfterSchoolClud, Jungkook sings part of Justin Bieber's Boyfriend while Jhope was beatboxing.\n\u2022 Eyes, Nose, Lips an M2 clip of Taehyung and Jungkook enjoying a videoke moment together, they chose Taeyang's hit song and harmonized well..\n\u2022 See Through young Kookie having a vocal practice during their pre-debut days.\n\u2022 Two Melodies during an audition for SOPA (School of Performing Arts) and he was 15 years old only when he shows off his talent and work his way to be an idol he is at the moment.\nJungkook is such a versatile singer, he's vocal range is impressive and it's stability is outstanding may it be live or recorded. He's been practicing for years and looking up to many idols while he makes a lot of cover songs from the hit ones or his favorites/influences. He practice English songs and even more so recording some pieces on his own style and discover his abilities. I'm not a vocal professional myself but I can say that Jungkook's has long run to take of his career because of his talent and determination. He has this passion one couldn't replicate.\nWe've been enjoying his cover songs for years and ready to face his anticipated mixtape. He is producing music, composing lyrics and directing his own videography/films (G.C.F.) - like what more of a surprise do we except from a Golden Maknae?\nThank you for making your way to the end of this blog. :hearts: What's your favorite cover song?\nWhen Jimin & Jungkook Collab..<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Discussion in 'K-pop' started by 3Xs, Oct 22, 2012.\nMinx - Why Did You Come To My House?\nThis week's chart is in!\nNot much news to report from the top as T-ara have the #1 single on the forum for a third week straight. \"Sugar Free\" leads again in plays and requests to score 100k flat.\nAilee is the latest victim of the #2 curse; \"Don't Touch Me\" is her second single to reach the runner's-up spot this year following \"Singing Got Better\", which was blocked from the top for two weeks behind Dal Shabet's \"B.B.B\". \"Don't Touch Me\" is Ailee's 5th top 10, all of which have gone top 5.\nIn perfect timing CRAYON POP log another OST hit just as their last one is getting a little stale. \"C'mon C'mon\" enters at #7 to become the group's 9th top 10 hit, and their 3rd this year. They now tie G-Dragon, BoA, and T-ara for second-most top 10's; only 2NE1, with 12, have more.\nZion.T only continues to grow with each release. Determined to go up the latter one rung at a time, his latest single \"Yanghwa Bridge\" enters at #8, following the #9 \"Miss Kim\" and the #10 \"Babay\" from last year. It is his 3rd solo top 10 and his 4th overall including his feature on Primary's 2012 #7 hit \"?\".\nTROY invade the top 10 for a second time this year; while their debut single \"GREEN LIGHT\" took its time to reach a #7 peak, their latest, \"Why are we?\", goes straight in at #10.\nOutside the top 10 rookie group MINX send their awkwardly-translated debut single \"Why Did You Come To My Home?\" in at #12, while #SLAYSTAR member #SLAYOU aka Soyu #SLAYS the chart to pieces at #14 with her Urban Zakapa duet \"The Space Between\".\nLastly there are two certs to get to - SISTAR make it to 1 million points with \"Touch My Body\" in a breakneck 10 weeks. It is the group's 3rd Platinum single, putting them in select company with 2NE1, After School and CRAYON POP as the only acts with 3 or more Platinum hits. It is the 31st Platinum single on our chart. 2NE1 finally crosses platinum with \"Happy\" after 20 weeks. It is the group's 8th Platinum single, only further extending their record for most singles over 1 million points. It is the 32nd Platinum single on our charts.\nI'm so happy Happy finally made it to Platinum. I'm probably in the minority, but it's my favourite track on CRUSH.\nMINX - Why Did You Come To My Home?\nTROY - Why are we?\nSorry for being so late with last week's video, I should have by this weekend the have this weeks up some time of the beginning of next week!\n2PM - Go Crazy!\nTROY- Why Are We?\nBut I haven't heard it yet... But I promise I'll get around to that soon.\nI love the song itself, but IU's voice in it annoys the heck out of me to the point where I just want to listen to an instrumental...\nCalm down, I have now listened to it.\nLast day to request!\nIgnore the little screw up with 'Eyes, Nose, Lips\" being small in both videos...<|endoftext|>"
