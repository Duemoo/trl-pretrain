        "passage": "Occidentalism \u00bb Blog Archive \u00bb Another Picture of \u201cDokdo\u201d from Ulleungdo?\nAnother Picture of \u201cDokdo\u201d from Ulleungdo?\nThe following picture of \u201cDokdo\u201d (Liancourt Rocks) was supposedly taken from Ulleungdo on January 15, 2007 with a Nikon D200 camera using a 70-300ED lens. It appears that you can see even the lighthouse on Dokdo, which is 92 kilometers southeast of Ulleungdo. Supposedly, even two mountain ridges near Samcheok City in Gangwon Province were also captured by the camera on the same day. The mountain ridges are between 130 and 150 kilometers away from Ulleungdo. Link to the Korean article.\nThe two islands of Usan and Mu-leung are due east of the present \u201chyeon\u201d (Uljin), and the distance between them is close enough that they are visible on a clear, windy day. In the time of Silla, they were called Unsan-guk or Ulleungdo.\nFinally, I would just like to remind people that Koreans back during the Joseon Dynasty did not have a Nikon camera with a zoom lens or a sign pointing in the direction of Dokdo. They also probably did not have the time and patience to sit on top of a mountain on Ulleungdo waiting to get a view of a ghost island that may appear only once in a blue moon.\nemprator, do you know from what elevation one is able to see Mount Clemente from San Diego?\nBad moon rising. We don\u2019t really need to determine whether or not Dokdo is visible from Ulleungdo when even Japanese records like the link I posted state it is true.\nFor what it is worth here are the sketches of Dokdo done by the Russian Navy in 1854. They are from different angles and distances. The top left image is Dokdo as seen from a distance of 6.5kms the bottom left is from 9.3kms and the top right is Dokdo Island as viewed from 26kms away. They were done from the naked eye and from sea level.\nCorrection the date of the map was 1857.\nIt took 40 days to this photograph with 500mm lens, according to the article on \u6bce\u65e5\u65b0\u805e at December 10, 1999.\nSure, the best way to verify Dokdo\u2019s visibility is to actually go to Ulleungdo. But Gerry-Bevers is wondering whether Dokdo is large enough to be seen from 92km away.\nThe link I got the quote from does not indicate the elvation from which San Clemente is visible. But if you\u2019re trying to relate that to Dokdo, I would think that elevation is important mostly because of line-of-sight.\nThat calculator seems to assume no refraction. This page on Distance to Horizon suggests that refraction extends the distance to apparent horizon, which would mean that the height required to see the whole of Dokdo is probably less than 700m.\nI\u2019m only trying to address the question of visibility. I don\u2019t see why so many people assume this photo is fake. If the capability of the camera is in question, someone familiar with the camera should calculate how many pixels Dokdo would take up in the picture if zoomed in all the way with the camera.\nIf your goal is to show Dokdo belongs to Korea or Japan, it\u2019s probably better to debate whether visibility is relevant to that issue.\n> Dokdo is/was not an inherent part of Japan since ancient times.\nTakeshima/Dokdo (Matsushima) was a part of Japan since early 17th century. Ulleungdo was also thought to be Japanese territory in the 17th century, as you can see in the Onsyu-Shicho-Gouki (1667) which clearly said that Ulleungdo was Japanese boundary. After Ulleungdo was returned to Korea in 1696, Takeshima/Dokdo remained in the Japanese territory.\n> I have about another dozen Shimane Prefecture maps that show the same.\nAs I\u2019ve written many times, a map without something doesn\u2019t mean anything although if a map with something clearly depicted, it will be a evidence to show that they knew it.\nJapan has accurate maps of Takeshima/Dokdo but Korea has none.\n> Pacifist are trying to claim that a military acquisition is a legitimate criteria for incorporating land!!\ntoadface, I didn\u2019t say it is legitimate to take one island brutally by force. Korea did it brutally and still keeps occupying it. You must remember that some Japanese fishermen were killed because of Korean violence, but in 1905 no Koreans were killed because there were no Koreans, they even didn\u2019t know about the island.\nJapan didn\u2019t take it brutally in 1905 because it was no man\u2019s land \u2013 at least Korea didn\u2019t know about the island until 1905. So Korea doesn\u2019t have a right to claim.\nIf you want to refute, why don\u2019t you bring the evidence to show that Korea knew it, used it or owned it before 1905?\nBut you haven\u2019t succeeded in it yet.\nIsn\u2019t it an essential thing if one country claim another country\u2019s land?\nFrom what I have read, if this picture was taken with a 500mm lens, then that means the image looks ten times bigger than it would look with the naked eye. Imagine an image one tenth the size of the one in the picture. It would be just a spot on the horizon. Not only that, it would be a spot that appears only when conditions are just right. If it took the photographer forty days waiting on a mountaintop to see that spot, even though he already knew which direction to point his camera, then how likely would it have been for Koreans trying to survive on Ulleungdo hundreds of years ago to have spotted that spot not knowing in which direction to look?\nIn 1882, Lee Gyu-won confirmed that Koreans did not know where \u201cDokdo\u201d was. He also went to the top of Ulleungdo\u2019s tallest mountain to look for islands on the horizon, but reported that he did not see \u201ceven a lump of dirt.\u201d Lee also confirmed that the Koreans living on Ulleungdo at the time also did not know where \u201cUsando\u201d (Dokdo) was. They had heard Usando was a neighboring island of Ulleungdo, but did not know its location.\nUsando was just another name for Jukdo, Ulleungdo\u2019s largest neighboring island, 2.2 kilometers off its northeast shore.\nThank you for the confirmation that Lee asked about Usan. So,<|endoftext|>"
