Simply right-click the highest parent folder and choose to synchronize. Lightroom will sync all the existing folders within that folder.\nThe goal of managing your photo library is to delete the bad photos and highlight your good ones, and you can start by using nags. Whenever you see a photo you like, press P to mark the photo as a pick, to mark the photo as a reject, hit the key X. A little message appears each time to tell you what you\u2019ve marked, and a little flag icon appears on the bottom left of that photo to indicate That it\u2019s been flagged \u2013 a white flag denotes a pick, a black flag denotes a reject. If you make a mistake, simply press u to un-flag it.\nThe great thing about using flags is that you can always view your picks easily by using the Attribute filter in the Library\u2019s central panel. Simply click on the white flag and all the photos you\u2019ve flagged as picks will appear.

Get the lowdown on next week's Walford drama.\nJanine (Charlie Brooks) has been trying to patch things up with her daughter Scarlett as she is being investigated by social services.\nHowever, the nine-year-old played by Tabitha Byron has been less than eager to have a relationship with her mother.\nUnbeknownst to her, Janine gets help from Mick (Danny Dyer) as he tells her she needs to prove she is a good mother.\nFollowing another one of Scarlett's rejections, Mick takes matters into his own hands to help the pair kiss and make up.\nMick gives Scarlett a special present, pretending it was all Janine's idea.\nBut while the gesture was certainly made out of kindness, Mick is unaware that stone-cold Janine is slowly but surely warming up to him.\nTwelve-year-old Bailey (Kara-Leah Fernandes) hatches a plan to push Karen (Lorraine Stanley) and Mitch (Roger Griffiths) back into each other's arms when she hears them argue over their sleeping situation.\nAnd while Karen complains to the young girl about a leak in the roof (which has led to the former couple sharing the same bed), Mitch gets a surprise delivery.\nWhen Karen receives her own parcel, Bailey is delighted to see everything is going according to her plan.\nShe even believes she can get away with it when she sees that Karen is none the wiser.\nHowever, Bailey's half-brother Keegan (Zack Morris) and Mitch soon clock on.\nA sympathetic Mitch has a chat with his daughter and tells he can't make him and Karen fall in love again.\n\nSoon after, Bailey and Mitch overhear her talk about the driver but get their hopes when they believe she is talking about her former partner.\nWill they realise their mistake?\nAfter his son Aaron's arrest, Harvey (Ross Boatman) decides to give himself and Dana (Barbara Smith) a fresh start by moving out of Albert Square.\nHe explains to Jack Branning (played by Scott Maslen) that he and his daughter need to leave and lies about his mother being ill.\n\nAccording to him, Jack could kick them out if he finds out about their link with Aaron.\nBut while Harvey is set to pack up and leave, Dana doesn't want to tag along.\nIs she hopeful to rekindle things with Bobby?\n\nBelieving she hung up on the phone, she subsequently reveals a huge secret while talking to Mila and Kioni\u2026 with Peter listening in.\nFaced with the possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison, it's no wonder why Phil (Steve McFadden) is so stressed.\nThe villain loses his cool when Kat (Jessie Wallace) puts his phone on silent so they can have some alone time.\nWhen he sees that he has missed multiple calls, Phil blames Kat and lashes out at her, only to apologise several moments later.\nKnowing he could never accept being an informant for the police, and to spare Kat from heartbreak, Phil makes a tough decision.\nAfter apologising to her for his behaviour, he puts an end to their relationship.\nKat is understandably distraught by this abrupt breakup.\nBut when Sharon (Letitia Dean) learns that Phil ended things with her, she knows the Walford baddie is hiding something.\nLying the pressure on him, Sharon eventually gets him to admit that he hasn't said anything to Kat about his potential life sentence.\nShe gives him a chance to come clean, adding that if he decided not to, she would be telling Kat everything herself.\nWhat will Phil do?\nRainie (Tanya Franks) and Stuart (Ricky Champ) for a united front against the latter's cancer.\nAnd after initially pushing her away from her upon finding out he was ill, Stuart lets Rainie in, letting her assist him during every step of his battle.\nDuring an emergency appointment scheduled by Rainie, the doctor explains the surgery Stuart will be undergoing and makes it clear that the operation should be planned as soon as possible.\nBut when the doctor mentions pain medication, Stuart immediately panics and tells Mick he feels he is being punished for his past.\nWhat is Stuart hiding?\nGray's (Toby-Alexander Smith) grasp on Chelsea is getting tighter.\nAlthough she was prescribed anti-depressants by her GP, Chelsea (Zaraah Abrahams) refuses to take the medication in order to breast feed her son Jordan.\nKheerat (Jaz Deol) gives her the chance to unwind at the salon, knowing she has been feeling defeated, while he distracts Gray by giving a lift to the hospital.\nBut when Chelsea relaxes with a sip of champagne, she gets an urgent call from Gray: Jordan has stopped breathing.\nWhile with Gray, Kheerat tries to get him to confess to Chantelle's murder but is interrupted by a doctor who urges the young father to make a decision.\nThe doctor announces that they can give Jordan a tracheotomy.\nGray agrees but becomes livid when Chelsea meets up with him and Keerat and he smells alcohol on her.\nWhen Kheerat steps in, adding that he paid for Chelsea's session, Gray is fuming and accuses him of being obsessed with his wives.\nLater on, Whitney (Shona McGarty) tries to talk to Chelsea but the latter is firmly under Gray's thumb.\nChelsea tells Whitney she no longer wants anything to do with her or Kheerat, putting an end to their plan to expose Gray.\nHas Chelsea really given up?<|endoftext|>Filming has officially begun on Jun Ji Hyun and Lee Min Ho\u2019s comeback drama!\nThe two Hallyu stars are playing the leads in SBS\u2019s \u201cLegend of the Blue

The famous \u201cChief Seattle\u201d speech that contains the lines above was made up for a Southern Baptist film project about pollution in 1971 (thanks to Russell Moore for the trivia tip). The writer, a professor of film named Ted Perry, was under contract to do the script, and he imagined what Chief Seattle might have to say about the environmental problems of the day. The words are moving\u2013so moving that people soon forgot they were invented, and they took on a life of their own.\nConservation writer and activist Andy Kerr has what looks like a fairly complete history of the origins of the speech Chief Seattle never actually made. Snopes.com has a standard copy of the Chief Seattle address.\nAccording to another account of the speech\u2019s origins, Perry\u2019s version was edited to make it more Christian. The version most folks see does contain a fair amount of religious language. It\u2019s more feel-good, pop theology than anything derived from Christian (or Jewish) scriptures (this was done in an era before theological conservatives began to ramp up the quality of Southern Baptist theological reflection). But you see the language cropping up often in environmental writing, and even in scholarly work. Al Gore apparently quoted the fake speech in his book Earth in the Balance. You can even find a Chief Seattle quote on the website of the Environmental Protection Agency.\nSo which is more shocking\u2013(1) that so many people love and adore a fake speech, (2) that in the 1970s Southern Baptists were producing films about pollution, or (3) that environmentalists so often quote a Southern Baptist document?\nYou can see an example of current Southern Baptist engagement with environmental theology by watching pastor and former SBC president James Merritt preach on the \u201cTheology of Ecology\u201d. Merritt would never have countenanced the dodgy theology of the Chief Seattle speech. He puts Christian environmental thought on a stronger Scriptural footing.\nThe real Chief Seattle was actually a Catholic, and he did give a speech, but the records are very poor on what he said. The much-published 1971 version has been revealed to be fake repeatedly, starting back in the 1990s, in publications such as Omni, Newsweek, and the New York Times (which published a front-page article on the myth of the Chief Seattle speech).<|endoftext|>Detects human PLG, human Plasmin, and the catalytic domain in direct ELISAs and Western blots.\nMeasured by its ability to neutralize Human Plasminogen (1 \u00b5g/mL, Catalog # 1939-SE) cleavage of the fluorogenic peptide substrate Suc-AFK-Amc (100 \u00b5M). The Neutralization Dose (ND50) is typically 1 \u00b5g/mL.\nNeutralization of Plasminogen Activity by Human Plasminogen Antibody. The cleavage of Suc-AFK-AMC (100 \u00b5M) by Human Plasminogen (1 \u00b5g/mL, Catalog # 1939-SE) is measured after preincubation with increasing concentrations of Mouse Anti-Human Plasminogen Monoclonal Antibody (Catalog # MAB1939). The ND50 is typically 1 \u00b5g/mL.\nPlasminogen (PLG) is the precursor of plasmin, an active serine protease that dissolves the fibrin of blood clots and acts in many other processes such as embryonic development, tissue remodeling, inflammation, and tumor invasion (1, 2). Synthesized in the kidney, PLG is found in plasma and many extracellular fluids. Activated by u- or t-plasminogen activator, the single-chain PLG (amino acid residues 20-810) is converted to plasmin, which consists of disulfide bond-linked heavy chain A (residues 20-580) and light chain B (residues 581-810). Heavy chain A contains 5 kringle domains and light chain B corresponds to the serine protease domain. A fragment consisting of the first 4 kringle domains has been named as angiostatin, a novel angiogenesis inhibitor (3, 4).\nPetersen, T.E. et al. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265:6104.\nForsgren, M. et al.

However, TMZ has short half\u2011life and frequently induces tumor resistance, which can limit its therapeutic efficiency. In the present study, it was hypothesized that combined treatment with TMZ and acteoside has synergistic effects in glioblastoma therapy. Using cell viability and wound\u2011healing assays, it was determined that this treatment regimen reduced cell viability and migration to a greater extent than either TMZ or acteoside alone. Following previous reports that TMZ affected autophagy in glioma cells, the present study examined the effects of TMZ + acteoside combination treatment on apoptosis and autophagy. The TMZ + acteoside combination treatment increased the cleavage of caspase\u20113 and levels of B\u2011cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl\u20112)\u2011associated X protein and phosphorylated p53, and decreased the level of Bcl\u20112. The combination treatment increased microtubule\u2011associated protein 1 light chain 3 and apoptosis\u2011related gene expression. It was also determined that TMZ + acteoside induced apoptosis and autophagy through the mitogen\u2011activated protein kinase signaling pathway. These findings suggest that acteoside has beneficial effects on TMZ\u2011based glioblastoma therapy.\nGlioblastoma is the most common type of malignant primary brain tumor and the most invasive and devastating primary brain tumor (1,2), with a median survival rate of ~18 months with aggressive multimodality therapy. Current treatment decisions are limited and include radiation, chemotherapy and surgery in combination with the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) (3,4). Despite the availability of aggressive therapies, patients with glioblastoma generally have a poor prognosis (5). TMZ is the major chemotherapeutic drug used in the clinical treatment of malignant glioblastoma (6-8); as an alkylating agent in the imidazotetrazine series, it is able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (9-11). During malignant glioblastoma progression and extensive invasion throughout the brain, steadily increasing drug resistance to TMZ decreases its therapeutic efficacy (12,13). Accordingly, novel therapeutic drugs to counter glioblastoma are urgently sought.\nPrevious studies have reported that glioma cells undergo cell death via autophagy, or type II programmed cell death, in response to TMZ (14,15). Autophagy can be inhibited by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) through the conversion of micro-tubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-I to LC3-II, thus reducing glioblastoma cell death (16,17); however, the role of autophagy is dependent on the cellular context. With the exception of a cytotoxic role during TMZ action, the induction of autophagy by cellular stress is a cytoprotective process that eliminates stress-induced cytoplasmic aggregates, organelles and macromolecules in mammalian cells through the lysosomal system. In turn, cells involved in maintaining homeostasis receive energy through these catabolic processes (18,19). The complex roles of autophagy suggest that an autophagy activator may have anticancer effects in combination with TMZ treatment by inducing glioblastoma cell autophagy without exerting deleterious effects or providing benefits to normal tissues. Of note, TMZ has exhibited synergistic therapeutic effects in combination with vitamin D, including suppressed cell viability and enhanced autophagy in glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, the combination of TMZ and vitamin D has been shown to exert anticancer effects in vivo, including reduced tumor size and prolonged survival rate. These studies suggest that combination treatment may have synergistic anticancer effects via autophagic mechanisms in TMZ-based glioblastoma therapy (15).\nActeoside is a phenylethanoid glycoside that is widely distributed in several tonified traditional Chinese herbal medicines (20,21). A number of pharmacological actions, including antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antinephritic and antimetastatic actions, have been associated with acteoside (22-24). Previous studies have demonstrated that acteoside has protective effects against carbon tetrachloride- and D-galactosamine-induced liver injury. The mechanisms underlying the protective effects of acteoside are likely related to its capacity to inhibit P450-mediated bioactivation and free radical scavenging effects induced by carbon tetrachloride exposure (25,26).\nTherefore, evidence suggests that both acteoside and TMZ induce anticancer effects through cell death. However, their association and anticancer effects in the context of glioblastoma remain to be elucidated. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to verify the synergistic anticancer effects of acteoside combined with TMZ in glioblastoma therapy. A cell viability assay was performed to analyze the anticancer effects of the combination treatment in C6 glioblastoma cells (a rat glioblastoma cell line), and the results were compared with those following treatment with TMZ alone. To further examine the mechanism of cell death caused by cotreatment with acteoside and TMZ, apoptosis- and autophagy-related genes in C6 cells were examined.\nThe C6 rat glioblastoma cell line was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA). The cells were cultured under sterile conditions at 37\u00b0C in a humid environment with 5% of CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1% antibiotics and antimycotics (all Welgene, Daegu, Korea).\nAbeliophyllum distichum Nakai [voucher no. Park1001(ANH)] was collected in Misunhyang Theme park, Seongbul-Mountain Recreation Forest, 78, Chungmin-rogigok-gil, Goesan-eup, Goesan-gun, Chungcheongbuk-do, Korea.\nTo induce callus formation (27), 1-cm2 leaf explants were isolated from the fresh plants. The explant was cultured on Murachige and Skoog medium (4% sucrose, 0.9% agar supplemented with 1 mg/l naphthalene acetic acid and 1 mg/l 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, pH 5.7) at 25\u00b0C. The callus was induced 20 days later. A sufficient quantity of acteoside was obtained through subculture to separate and purify acteoside from the callus (Fig. 1). Different batches of purified acteoside were used in each experiment. Each experiment was performed three times using a different batch.\nThe ethylacetate fractions were concentrated in vacuo and used as a sample for the purification of acteoside. Acteoside was isolated and purified by the Accelerated Chromatographic Isolation system (Isolera\u2122 Spektra, Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden) using SNAP KPHOSPHO-SIL and SNAP Ultra Cartridges (Biotage). The acteoside purified from the callus was quantitatively analyzed using the standard acteoside by HPLC-PDA analysis. Finally, acteoside of \u226595% purity was obtained from the callus and used as a sample for chemotherapy of temozolomide-based glioblastoma.\nTo identify the TMZ half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 value) against C6 cells, 1\u00d7104 cells in single cell suspensions were seeded into individual wells of 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C prior to TMZ treatment at the indicated concentrations (1, 5, 10, and 20 mM) at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. Following determination of the TMZ IC50 value as 5 mM, the cells were treated for 24 h with 5 mM TMZ, 50 \u00b5M acteoside, or a combination of the two (5 mM TMZ"

So, I don't know what kind of support you have to help you with the children. If you're a single mom and you have young children, often you can feel like you work just to pay for daycare. If this is your case then you can often start resenting your job for taking you away from your children and leaving you with very little money to show for all your efforts. If these are your realities, then once again focus on changing your perspective about your work and start getting motivated to change your work situation with some support.\nIf you have great allies, or at the very least trustworthy and dependable people that can help you from time to time, reach out and treat yourself to some \u201cme-time\u201d or time with your friends. Look at taking time for you as a gift to your children. If mommy gets her needs met then she will be an even better, more fulfilled, happy mommy...ready to take on that great next adventure with ease and an energized presence. If you don\u2019t take time out for you, you may be depriving your children of getting the \u201cbest you\u201d that they can have.\nWhen you don't get your needs met you tend to be distracted with unfinished nagging tasks or by your thoughts and wishes to get what you want or need. These distractions keep you from being fully present with your children, at work or with someone else.\n Take time to look at all you are; see all your great qualities. Recognize all that you have accomplished. If you have a hard time with this, then reach out and I'll help you spell it out clearly.\nIf you do have a significant other, then the fact that you didn't even mention them says to me that you're not getting all the support you need and your relationship could need some TLC, too. Find a way to communicate your feelings, your wants and needs to them, so they can help you.\nOften our partners are clueless to what we really need, until we tell them. Most of the time, we are even in the dark about it, too. This is another reason to get clarity. If you have a partner and they're not supportive of you or your needs; if they are not one that you can easily communicate with, then they\u2019re not getting what they really need either. If they were, they would be more supportive, happier and more attentive to you. If this is something you can relate to, then know you're not alone. Very few people are taught how to take care of their own needs or how to communicate effectively. The great thing is\u2026it\u2019s never too late to learn! Just as it is never too late to learn how to use A Mom's Guilt, to empower you.\nFrom what you've written, it sounds to me like you're lacking some security in your life. Perhaps you need to feel more important, beyond being Mom. Figure out what's really missing and then devise a plan to go after what you want more of in your life.

The survey was conducted by an Ad Hoc Committee on Graduate Programs released in early February, Davidson said via email.\nThe proposal will be reviewed soon by the faculty Committee on Academic Planning (CAP) and the Graduate Council Committee (GCC), which work together to evaluate all of the College\u2019s graduate programs.\nThe decision will ultimately be made by President Vickers and other members of the administration.

Several years ago, the Board of Trustees created a \u201cfinancial equilibrium\u201d plan for the College. Part of this plan includes keeping the number of tenured faculty constant: so, whenever a tenure-track position in one department is created, such a position in another department must be eliminated. According to Pahomov, the Computer Science department, which gained the new tenure-track position, \u201cdesperately needed another appointed faculty member.\u201d There are other \u201coversubscribed\u201d departments as well, he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re a small college, probably with more programs than anyplace else our size,\u201d Pahomov said, adding that the number of good programs at Bryn Mawr necessitates the \u201cfinancial equilibrium\u201d concept in order to keep all the departments equally staffed.\nEndowment for the Humanities to come to Bryn Mawr to study the Russian program.

There aren't any big surprises or huge moments, no sad tears or heartbreak... just a sweet, predictable romance, witty dialogue, hot sex and a genuinely likeable couple.\nSamanthe Beck's debut novel is perfect for a fun, steamy read!\n4.5 shining bright stars!\nGood Gravy Beans, I loved this one. I laughed and giggled - yes giggled - throughout.\nAs others have said, this has been done before, but who cares when it is redone as well as this?\n# A wonderfully liberating natural and outspoken heroine, Ellie. The small city homecoming doctor.\n# A former bad-boy hero, the village's sexiest man Tyler, who is still running a MC and is visible at the local pub.\n\u201cPromise to teach me...\nSometimes you just get the perfect book at the perfect time after a whole pile of not-so"

        "passage": " for me, and I like sports conspiracy theories. I can\u2019t see Yzerman going for a move that would likely be subject to a grievance if there was any chance of it being perceived as less than legal.\nThat said\u2026 I want the Wings to take bad cap dollars on to gain other assets but Johnson\u2019s deal is really bad. Four more seasons at $5 million per year for a guy whose numbers dropped off dramatically during the Bolts\u2019 Cup run. That side deal would have to be extremely impressive to make that move.\nAs free agency moves on, the Red Wings still need a goalie, probably at least one defenseman, and maybe some forwards. I\u2019d hold off and save some of those roster slots for potential salary dump deals but that\u2019s just me.\nIn goal, Thomas Greiss is still on the board, and he\u2019d probably be my top choice. As I write this, Corey Crawford signed with New Jersey for less than $2 million per season, which seems to be a sign that goalie contract numbers are getting back to sane after Markstrom\u2019s ridiculous deal.\nI wonder about Tyson Barrie on defense. Coming off a relatively bad season in Toronto, a \u201cshow me\u201d deal could work. I still think I\u2019d prefer a trade candidate, though.\nThe Detroit Red Wings announced the signings of forwards Kyle Criscuolo and Riley Barber and goalie Kevin Boyle on Friday.\nAll three are likely AHL-bound, assuming there actually is an AHL campaign in the coming season.\nCriscuolo should be a familiar name to Griffins fans, having played 80 games with the team during the 2015-16 and 2016-17 seasons, winning the Calder Cup with Grand Rapids the second year.\nBoyle is a little bit of a surprise as Detroit already has Cal Pickard, Kaden Fulcher, and Filip Larsson under contract for next season. Given Larsson\u2019s struggles at the AHL level, though, an insurance policy does make sense.\nThe Detroit Red Wings added some depth to their defense on Friday, signing former University of Michigan defenseman Jon Merrill to a one-year deal.\nMerrill spent the last three seasons with the Vegas Golden Knights after starting his career with the New Jersey Devils.\nI\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t have strong feelings about this signing. He\u2019s a cheap depth guy on a one-year deal, so I\u2019m down with that, but I have no feelings about Merrill himself either way.\nJersey number geek notes: Merrill wore #24 at Michigan and Antti Tuomisto isn\u2019t coming over this year so I\u2019ll guess Merrill takes that number with Detroit.<|endoftext|>We're just one month away from the release of Avengers: Endgame, and Marvel Studios is celebrating with a new batch of character posters in support of the film. Sporting the tagline \"Avenge the Fallen,\" the posters are all close-ups of characters' faces, and as expected, many of them confirm what the trailers have already told us.\nWe know already that the film will feature the survivors of Thanos' (Josh Brolin) snap \u2014 among them Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Iron Man (Tony Stark), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) \u2014 enacting some kind of last-ditch plan to take back what they lost, with a little help from their new friend Captain Marvel (Brie Larson). Those characters, in keeping with the most recent trailer, are shown in color on their posters. Characters who didn't survive \u2014 including Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Vision (Paul Bettany), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) \u2014 appear in black and white.\nThis is all pretty easy to follow, but what makes this batch of posters particularly interesting is that they seem to confirm a few things we didn't know for sure about various supporting characters, and the biggest news seems to be that Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) is alive and well following the snap, and will apparently join the fight in the new film. Thor's new ally and fan-favorite character from Thor: Ragnarok was last seen onboard the Asgardian refugee ship at the end of that film, but didn't make an appearance in Avengers: Infinity War, leading many fans to worry about her eventual fate.\nAlso alive: Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), Tony's loyal bodyguard and friend who was last seen in Spider-Man: Homecoming, and Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), Tony's fiance. Sadly, the posters also confirm some people we lost off-camera, like Shuri (Letitia Wright), Black Panther's science genius little sister. That's a gut punch.\nNotably, the posters also include three characters who died in the last film in ways other than the snap: Loki, who was choked to death by Thanos; Gamora, who was thrown of a cliff by Thanos; and Vision, who was killed when Thanos ripped the Mind Stone from his skull.\nObviously we don't expect characters like Black Panther and Spider-Man to stay dead forever, and the Avengers' ultimate plan is expected to restore a lot of things to the MCU, but will that include characters who were dead before the snap even happened? This remains one of the film's biggest mysteries, and these posters only add to the suspense. Check out all of the posters assembled via Marvel's official Twitter account below.\nAvengers: Endgame arrives April 26.<|endoftext|>Transparent Optical Switches: Technology Issues and Challenges\n\nIncreased traffic volume due to the introduction of new broadband services is driving carriersto the deployment of an optical transport layer based on Wavelength Division Multiplexing(WDM) [1]. The network infrastructure of existing core networks is currently undergoing atransformation from rings using SONET Add/Drop Multiplexers (ADMs) to mesh topologiesusing Optical Cross-connects (OXCs). A core optical network architecture can be opaque ortransparent. An opaque architecture means that the optical signal carrying traffic undergoesan Optical to Electronic to Optical (OEO) conversion at different places in the network. Atransparent architecture means that the optical signal carrying traffic stays in the opticaldomain from the time it is generated at the edge of the network until it leaves the network.Even though the applications driving thelarge scaledeployment of transparent optical switches are notcurrently in place (niche applications in today\u2019s networks onlyuse a very small number of transparent switches), and the trafficdemand does notcurrently justify theuse of transparentswitches that are cost effective at very high bit rates,it is possible that atsome point in the futuretransparent switches may be deployed in the network. Based on thisassumption, this paper explores the technology issues and challenges that are associated with3D MEMS-based switch fabrics. These fabrics offer the most viable approach to makesingle-stage switch fabrics with large portcounts that can be used for thedeployment of transparent switches in the network.Figure illustrates the four different node architectures that can comprise a core optical1network. The first architecture shows a fixed patch panel. Fixed patch panels located betweenWDM systems with transponders are currently being replaced by opaque (OEO) switchingnodes (with electrical switch fabrics) as shown in architectureof Figure (b). This is an1 opaque network architecture, as the optical signal undergoes OEO conversions [2]. The thirdarchitecture shows a transparent (OOO) switch between WDM systems with transpondersthat iscomplemented by an OEO switch for drop traffic. This is once again an opaquenetwork architecture, as the optical signal undergoes OEO conversions at the WDM<|endoftext|>The incidents of sexual harassment and other form of violence against women are skyrocketing at an alarming rate. It is undeniable that this rape culture did not grow overnight.\nThere is an underlying reason for it: A culture of impunity. But the time is now to fight back against violence against women.\nAfter a home-maker was raped and tortured on September 2 in Begumganj upazila of Noakhali, people from all around the country began protesting for justice.\nWhat\u2019s ridiculous is that the police, who are responsible for ensuring the safety of all citizens, came to know about this heinous incident over a month later when footage of the assault went viral on Facebook. This is a reflection of how prompt police officers are at fulfilling their key responsibilities.\nThis is not a rare case in the history of Bangladesh. There have been numerous times when women had to experience harassment in schools, workplaces, and outside.\nAccording to Ain O Salish Kendra, from January to September this year, 975 women were raped, 43 of whom died after, and 12 committed suicide after being raped.\nA media report says that the number of rape incidents was 1,413 last year. This clearly demonstrates that occurrences of sexual harassment is widespread. And these are only the ones which have been reported.\n If no, what is the judiciary doing? What are the police officers for? What are the judges for?\nAround 200,000 cases of abuse involving women and children are pending in 64 districts across the country.\nOut of them, 40,000 have been pending for more than five years; nearly 70% of these 40,000 cases have been waiting more than 10 years to be disposed of.\nSeeing these frustrating statistics of negligence by the justice departments, it can definitely be said that a culture of impunity is one of the prime reasons for such a spike in rape cases"

I would highly recommend holiuni.\nI would highly recommend this course to anyone who is wants to get into Yin Yoga and incorporate Yin Yoga in their teachings. I\u2019m a yoga teacher who teaches the elderly, mostly through local hospitals. Therefore the chapters on modifications of poses and alternatives using props and support were very beneficial.\nI loved taking this course, really recommend it. Both the theoretical and practical parts are well explained, I could study without any problems.\nClear and structured. The videos offer high quality content and it\u2019s great that you can watch them again. I feel confident to start teaching Yin Yoga.\nOnce you have found the time to fit this course into your own personal schedule, it is comprehensive. Very detailed explanation and also gives the possibility to go to an even deeper level and to do research. Really enjoyed the course so far.\nFor me this was the best option to follow the course.

There is no higher power who decides whats right and whats wrong. Morals are subjective and crucial for a species survival. Thus they vary from individual to individual, group to group. There is only one way to decide which is the most successfull or the \"best\" and that is conflict. You can think of it like darwanism, might makes right, survival of the fittest or if you want to be less philisophical, a comon example of conflict deciding morales is a political debate. Verbal confict between two ore more parties resulting in the winner being able to enforce/ implement their way.\nEdit: here is a wall of text<|endoftext|>[Weekender] Like it hot!\nLate last month, two giant chili statues occupied a corner of Seoul Plaza, in front of City Hall, drawing interest from foreign tourists and passers-by. The air carried the unmistakable scent of the fiery spice.\nFarmers\u2019 booths nearby had loads of freshly harvested, sun-dried red chilies, ready to be ground into gochu-garu -- chili powder -- or to be aged into thick, fermented chili paste, gochujang.\nThe Aug. 27-29 Yeongyang H.O.T. Festival led to on-the-spot sales and delivery orders for chilies and related farm products totaling nearly 2 billion won ($1.7 million), organizers said.\nFrom mid-August to this week, three more such events were held in rural towns famous for their chilies: Eomseong, Goesan and Cheongyang.\nSouth Korea is in its peak season for red hot chili peppers. In late summer and early fall, the pungent spice, which provides the basis for the heat and color of many Korean dishes, arrives at the market in its best form and in abundance.\nKang Gyeong-sook, a 60-something housewife, visited Seoul Plaza to bulk purchase the peppers.\n\u201cChili is the most important spice.\u201d she said without hesitation.\nWhat she had in mind was the approaching gimjang -- the kimchi-making season in early winter, when families prepare a large quantity of the pickled cabbage dish for consumption throughout the year.\n\u201cDuring the gimjang season, chili prices go up,\u201d Kang\u2019s friend chimed in. They were each looking to buy at least 12 kilograms of dried chilies, or 20 geun in the traditional Korean unit of weight.\nKorea\u2019s per-capita chili consumption stood at around 3 kilograms in 2017, down from 3.7 kilograms in 2013. That is about 8 grams of chilies per day. It is the most consumed vegetable here.\nThe small, fiery fruit is now such an integral part of Korean cuisine that even toddlers have their daily fix of kimchi -- though it could be a milder version -- even before they learn how to use chopsticks.\nHowever, it was only in the postwar era that Koreans began to develop such a deep fondness for the spice.\nChilies are believed to have first arrived here in the 16th century and were widely cultivated in the 18th century. But until the 1950s, they did not have such a big presence on Korean dining tables.\nAccording to Ahn Jung-youn, a researcher at the National Folk Museum of Korea, the stress of postwar society sparked the popularity of chilies.\n\u201cThe Korean War and the years that followed were no doubt a time of extreme difficulties. \u2026 There is a link between a society\u2019s stress level and the yearning for spicy food,\u201d she said.\nAs the nation recovered from the war and rebuilt its economy at an unprecedented speed,"

She was an avid reader and loved her travels with Reid and friends to Asia, Europe, nearly every state, and many cruises. Some of her fondest years were the eleven spent at Camp Parsons, a Boy Scout camp on Hood Canal where Reid and her son and daughter worked as staff members. Barbara also worked part-time in several Bellevue Public Schools as a library aide.\nBarbara and Reid spent the 30 plus years of retirement at the family home on Bainbridge Island that Reid grew up in. She treasured the many friends and neighbors in their community, always offering a smile and time to chat. Her book club gatherings in later years were a highlight. She devoted many volunteer hours at the Bainbridge Island Historical Museum, Bainbridge Senior Center, and the Seattle Children\u2019s Bainbridge Bargain Boutique. She loved to play cards, particularly pinochle, and do crossword puzzles.\nBarbara was preceded in death by her parents, sister Dorothy Jean, and son Michael Reid.

I was one among the 15 participants selected for the first OLC-South Asia Course of 10 month duration, with online and two residential modules of 10 days (Near Mumbai, Maharashtra, April, 2012) and 7 days (http://www.ifoam.bio/en/olcsouth-asia-2012 ) in Bangalore (November, 2012). As a part of this training, each one of us created Development Plans (DPs) to be pursued after completion of the course.\nFrom the 60 applications they received, 24 participants from 18 countries were selected for a 6 days training at Goesan, South Korea, during 24-29 April, 2017. Well in advance, the IFOAM Academy published a document describing the profile of the course participants, indicating their achievements in context of their DPs (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0TX5SvS4lMRVUx3ZkVLaUpod2s/view. Also, well before the start of the current course, the programme schedule was mailed to all the participants (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0TX5SvS4lMRblN1cDF5Vmd6ZXM/view.\nThe Honorable Deputy Governor of the Goesan province, addressed the participants, who were introduced to him by the course Director. The inauguration activity was crisp and finished as per schedule within 30 minutes.\nWell planned technical sessions were mostly group exercises with presentation by the course participants, wherein, presentation methods like world caf\u00e9, open space, fish bowl, cards, charts, etc., were used. These sessions were interactive and participatory, enabling everyone to contribute to the discussions, thus making the methodology used, a good, participatory experience.\nproduce products believing human and nature as well as the urban and rural areas are connected in the string of life. The consumers buy the products, relating to this thought of the producers. It is a good concept worth replicating in other developing countries, though it has its own set of issues. We also visited an organic farm by name 10 Farmers, which was diverse in its produce and had its own retail store to sell its farm produce.\nThe course participants continue to send their free and frank feedback on the course, which is highly appreciative. The constructive criticism of the course (Box 1), in fact, may be used by the IFOAM Academy to improve this course in the future. Many participants including myself felt the duration of the course could have been a little longer, maybe 10 days. The course director assured that the feedback will be analyzed and a general reflection on this course would be shared in coming days. The participants were also interested to have more interactions with organic farmers there and listen to their practical experiences to contrast the experiences with the farmers back home. Maybe the time constraint did not allow this, nevertheless, many of us felt the need for it.\nMy expectation was, as master class alumni, we should have come up with at least an organic leadership output that can be country/region specific, based on the organic leadership course, our DPs and experiences \u2013 for scaling up. For example, it could be an organic leadership training design that would be appropriate for the agriculture policy makers or for organic practitioners and/or for agricultural extension workers. In this way, there will be a training guide developed by a pool of experts on how to train future organic leaders in their respective areas. It will also be a good attachment for proposal on organic training funding. I hope this will be taken into consideration as one idea on future master class.\nProgram/ workshop topics may be reconsidered, clear statement before outset or at start of class on expectations and outcomes from the course \u2013 in collaboration with participants, excursions built in earlier in the program. These were really excellent and well chosen (Hansalim, 10 Farmers etc), and they gave great insight into organic agriculture, direct selling and consumer organization. Development Plan tactic \u2013 further development plan for each participant perhaps? Longer course could be considered, for various reasons (including jetlag?)as we took time to start interacting as a group, group exercises / icebreakers at the start, to develop trust and ideas between members, we went immediately into output mode. Topic suggestions: Participate in discussions about the future of organic agriculture e.g., Vision development or envision, the future of organic; fuller examination of Organic 3.0 and concepts and how and what to implement; suggestions on how to improve organic agriculture and take-up in each Participant\u2019s local context; selecting success stories/ identifying elements that might work in the participants\u2019 local context, and replicating and scaling organic agriculture success stories.\nWhile we are slowly receiving everyone\u2019s feedback, do we also try and find a way \u2013 collectively (but virtually), to envision and create a \u201cwhere do we go from here\u201d plan? I remember we didn\u2019t quite formulate one or didn\u2019t reach a consensus. That, or we just let it be? \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019ve been going over my notes and the common theme has been: local, empowerment, communicating to the grassroots/farmers/smallholders, cultural shifts and a more enabling environment versus regulation. Let me know what everyone thinks, and if you all want to move this forward with a commitment to a project/initiative or if we just let it be.\nI enjoyed OLC a lot; agree with most of your comments. Personally, I think it was a pity we did not have more time to present success stories of our work in more detail. People can always share the best topics they are really into, frontal talks maybe old-fashioned but input can be very good.\nI would have liked to discuss and examine more of the Organic 3 as mentioned by Tracy and Ailbhe. This will be on another occasion and probably at Organic World Congress 2017 in India. I agree with Ailbhe, that we should have discussed on how to improve organic agriculture in each participant\u2019s local context. As Mahesh said, the value chain and group / cooperative farming approach being done by Hansalim, is an excellent model to follow in our countries. Finally, David\u2019s idea for the creation of an OLC Alumni Network is a priority to take advantage of international expertise in the organic field. From my part, I suggest the creation of a platform reserved for distance learning courses with discussion forums. These courses could deal with very specific aspects such as composting, organic intensification, organic innovations, etc.\nThe Course Director responded to the feed- back and gave his equally frank reflection on the course (Box2).\nWhile applying to the course, the prospective participants were asked to submit a motivation letter, as to why they want to participate in this course? On completion of the course, in their feedback, they have mentioned whether their expectations from the course were met or not. The course participants took a keen interest in giving their constructive feedback with an intent to see similar programmes being organized in a better way.\nThe programme focused on technical content, presentations, and learning and sharing from the experiences of diverse set of participants in a participatory mode. It\u2019s a good practice worth replicating in training programmes that are organized. The inaugural session was so brief and took only 30 minutes, which helped by providing adequate time for other more relevant sessions.\nProfessional way of handling the programme, the logistics, catering, accommodation, transport etc., were outstanding. These lessons could be useful to make training programmes organized by us more impactful.\nThere were a lot of positive outcomes, especially the opportunity to"

Adopted at three years old in 1984 by loving parents, Kara was mostly disinterested in finding her birth family. But when Kara became a mother and her daughter approached the same age as when she was abandoned, Kara couldn\u2019t understand why her mother would give her up. Kara began an intense search to find her parents.\nKara researched adoptee forums on Facebook, adoptee rights organizations, and online genealogy platforms.

The program is designed to empower family physicians with new ways to promote physical activity, nutrition, and emotional well-being for the entire family. The endeavor will be administered by Americans In Motion (AIM), an AAFP initiative that improves the health of all Americans through multifaceted fitness programs.\n\"In order to combat childhood obesity effectively, we need to target not just the children, but the entire family,\" said Jim King, M.D., president of the AAFP. \"Children learn by example, and a household that, as a unit, makes sure to include regular exercise and balanced diets in its day-to-day life is much more likely to have children who are happy and healthy.\"\nThe partnership will produce and distribute an educational DVD and children's book, for use in physician waiting rooms, that encourages patients to talk with family physicians about fitness and to work together to develop a plan that enables sustained healthy lifestyle choices among family members. The educational materials, due to be distributed in the spring and summer of 2009 to more than 36,600 family physicians and 457 family medicine residency training programs, will be available in both English and Spanish. The materials will discuss fitness for the family, with a special emphasis on ways to maintain fitness for children through a balance of physical activity, nutrition, and emotional well-being.\n\"The family physician can help combat the growing threat of childhood obesity, by providing families with much-needed information from a trusted source,\" said Sibyl Jacobson, president of MetLife Foundation. \"MetLife Foundation is pleased to help support this program, which offers information about the importance of making smart decisions that can result in longer, healthier lives.\"\nToday's children may have a shorter life expectancy than their parents because of obesity-related illnesses. Almost 60 percent of Americans do not get sufficient daily exercise, and almost 65 percent of Americans are overweight or obese. The family physician conducts 210 million patient visits each year, and is in a strong position to positively influence the fitness habits of their patients, helping to fight childhood obesity on a national scale.\nMetLife Foundation was established by MetLife in 1976 to carry on its longstanding tradition of corporate contributions and community involvement.

Let readers understand the true(non- mainstream media) dynamic at play. PM Justin Trudeau informs Canadian that our nation has a serious problem of an aging demographic and workforce.\nHis pit-bull from Somalia, Immigration Minister MP Ahmed Hussen, tells Canada we must maintain the highest immigration quotas per-capita in the western world, in order to off-set a lack of Canadian workers. Over 90% of these imports come from Hussen\u2019s chosen African, Islamic and Third World nations. These are Hussen\u2019s people, and this is who he chooses to import\u2013even the illegal ones.\nWhat government or media never speak of is the fact that our current and previous governments could have set up programs to motivate Canadians to have more children in lieu of a problem that has been understood for DECADES. They did no such thing.\nWhat was set up was the most open, no-limits, FULL-TERM permissible fetus destruction. The man who created this was Pierre Trudeau. It was he who placed a European refugee in charge of the program\u2013a man named Dr. Henry Morgantaler.\nThis sketchy fellow claimed to have personally performed 5000 abortions. At the time, his behaviour was against the law. Memories of Trudeau Dynasty?

        "passage": "etic two-week marathon of the United Nations Framework Convention Climate Change negotiations that take place very December.\nThe IPCC meeting came just after the news broke that greenhouse gas levels have reached 400 parts per million in the Arctic for the first time.\nThis is an important threshold. It is more than 800,000 years since there was this much CO2 in the atmosphere. The 2007 IPCC assessment stated that to avoid dangerous changes to our climate, global greenhouse gas levels have to be stabilized at 350 ppm. To get there, a global commitment is needed to reduce CO2 emissions by 40 per cent by 2020 over 1990 levels. There was supposed to be a new binding climate change treaty by 2009. Instead, the negotiations nearly collapsed that year in Copenhagen and since then governments have produced only fine statements, a framework for further negotiations and reduced targets.\nSince 2009, Canada, the United States and other countries have latched on to unscientific targets that make good sound bites. Canada and the U.S. committed to reduce their emissions by 17 per cent over 2005 levels. Just to be sure no one was confused about the real commitment of the Harper government, Canada withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, making it the only country in the world to officially abrogate this binding international agreement.\nThis spring the government slashed environmental protection legislation and demonized environmental groups and anyone who dared to criticize its no-hold-barred push for \"responsible resource development.\" The message was clear: You are either for the economy or the environment. You can't be both.\nAny hope of a sensible climate change policy based on science and fact rather than ideology and rhetoric has all but vanished off the government's radar. As the National Roundtable on the Economy and Environment (NRTEE) reported recently, \"Canada will not achieve its 2020 GHG emission reductions target unless significant new, additional measures are taken. More will have to be done. No other conclusion is possible.\"\nOf course, the Harper government doesn't need this kind of advice. After 20 years, the NRTEE, a body established by Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, has had its funding eliminated. In the words of Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird, why should the government continue to pay for advice it doesn't want to hear?\nYou don't have to go very far to see what the consequences of this kind of position. For a government that claims to have Arctic interests at heart, the policies of the Harper government are relegating a vast portion of the region to irreversible change.\nOn Canada Day, while Harper cabinet ministers fanned across the country to wave flags, flip burgers, and deliver the uniform lines about jobs, prosperity and growth fashioned in the Prime Minister's office, an updated graphic appeared on the website of the National Snow and Ice Data Centre in Boulder, Colorado. The centre produces daily updates of real-time satellite tracking of the state of Arctic sea ice. On July 1, the graphic showed a continued drop in multi-year sea ice that indicates that 2012 could beat previous record lows from 2007.\nHumans are causing this problem. Yes, the climate has cycles and natural variation. But at no time in planetary history has this much warming occurred in such a short time. It's not caused by sunspots or volcanoes and it's above the levels of the natural cycle, all of which skeptics and their paymasters like to point to. And even if we weren't causing it, we would have to take precautionary measures to ensure that we can adapt to it.\nWhat we know as human civilization has developed in the clement period since the last ice age -- a period of about 10,000 years. One hundred centuries may seem like a long time to us but it is a blink of the geological eye. While the planet will eventually rebalance itself -- in thousands of years -- we need to ask ourselves if what we know as human society will be around to see it.\nSince we can't answer this question with certainty, we need to think deeply about where our political leaders are taking us, in this country and elsewhere.\nThere is no chance of a healthy economy without a livable environment.\nJohn Crump is a CCPA research associate and an expert on Arctic and global environmental issues.

In 2008 and 2009, the cultivars were tested for resistance to the Pc003 isolate collected in Youngyang, Gyeongbuk province. In 2010, the selected cultivars in the previous years were tested by inoculating with 3 isolates obtained from the pepper plants in Miryang in Gyeongnam province, Youngyang in Gyeongbuk province, and Goesan in Chungbuk province. A continuous variation in resistance from highly resistant to susceptible was observed among the commercial pepper cultivars. It was also noted that some cultivars, although their names were initiating with ``Yeokgang`` or ``PR`` meaning Phytophthora resistance, were very low in resistance or susceptible. When the resistant cultivars selected in 2008 and 2009 experiment were inoculated with the 3 isolates, all the commercial cultivars except a rootstock, ``Tantan``, succumbed to the exceptionally virulent Pc005 (Miryang) isolate. Pc002 (Goesan) was a little more virulent than Pc003 (Youngyang). A few cultivars resistant to Pc003 (Youngyang) were severely infected by Pc002 (Goesan). Significant interaction in analysis of variance suggested the differential interactions between cultivars and pathogen isolates. Strategies to breed cultivars having high level of resistance to the highly variable pathogenic fungus, Phytophthora capsici, were discussed.<|endoftext|>He will LOVE his Blowfish Vepper Space Boys\u2019 (13-5) Casual Shoe!

It was a couple of weeks into Orientation before I finally had the time and energy to spend a night out. It was the night after our placement ceremony, and I wanted to celebrate.

During Joseph Conrad\u2019s lifetime, little objectiveness was made over his 1899 novel Heart of Darkness. This novel, which possibly has Conrad\u2019s numerous endowments as an author, has been perused as a scorching evaluation of European colonialism in Africa. It remains today, a standout amongst the most omnipresent matters in college course syllabi around the United States and with it comes a various range of perspectives, studies, and emotions.\nIt goes to lengths to scrutinize the prudence of ill-natured Europeans, so intensely established in the social cognizance of the book. It makes a point of demonstrating the unsafe impacts the colonial exertion has on the mind of both its narrator and its focal character, Marlow. Which is all to state that it is no longer astounding that such a commonly perused work ought to be the concern of a lot of controversies.\nThis 1899 novel by Joseph Conrad is showing how the author is struggling with his acceptance with having a bigoted viewpoint and encompasses colonialism by nature with stories of imperialist conquest. For the first situation, the controversy begins with how Conrad\u2019s writings are often proclaimed as a triumph of anti-colonial estimation; however, it is just as racist as anyone would primarily anticipate nineteenth-century writings on Africa to be. In Daniel and Brigit Marie-Katkin\u2019s article, these two are criticizing the nature of Joseph Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness and its contention of the crude appeal and the manner of acculturated appearances of wickedness disadvantaging the African people by Marlow and his Company men.\nAfricans move toward becoming Marlow\u2019s focal point, with who he can play out his philosophical and existential battles. Their reality and their exoticism empower his self-examination. In Todd Kuchta\u2019s article imagology gives an ideologically unbiased strategy for investigation and targets the focal point"

And this is normally correct if RET process is fast, but still need to check if concentrations of quenching species such as H 2 O to OH is very high [54,[68][69][70]. Furthermore, the laser power needs to be kept low and linear LIF is achieved to avoid stimulated emission and large depletion of initial pumped state density.\nIn many cases the excitation radiations locate range of deep UV (e.g., <100 nm) and are strongly absorbed by ambient gaseous medium (e.g., air or water molecules), then two-photon excitation in the UV spectral range (>200 nm) can be applied for the same diagnostic purpose, namely the so-called two-photon absorption LIF (TA-LIF) [49]. Compared to single-photon LIF, TA-LIF is considerably less efficient and the excitation rate scales with the square of laser power. Normally higher laser power is required to produce detectable fluorescence intensity, but laser stimulated effects including photon-ionization, induced breakdown, stimulated emission, etc. needs to be avoided [71,72]. Table 3 lists excitation schemes of TA-LIF for various active atomic species in plasmas. An example of twodimensional distribution of atomic oxygen in an atmospheric-pressure plasma jet-source by TA-LIF is presented in Figure 4.\n\nAbsorption spectroscopy\nAnother important diagnostic technique for atmospheric-pressure plasmas is absorption spectroscopy (AS) [77]. Compared to LIF or OES approaches, AS is an in\n\nSpecies\nExcitation transition Fluorescence transition Calibration Ref.\nRayleigh of air [50][51][52][53][54] NO NO gas [55][56][57][58][59] Rayleigh [65,66]   situ and non-invasive technique probing absolute densities of interested species without need of extra calibration and independent on collisional quenching process. It relies on the Beer-Lambert law: where I s is the light intensity passing through sample, I 0 is the incident radiation, N is species density, \u03c3\u03bb \u00f0\u00deis the wavelength dependent absorption cross-section, and L is the absorption path-length. If probed species density is low, the absorption length is normally increased by using a multi-pass spectroscopic absorption cell where light reflects between two mirrors, e.g., the Herriott cell [78]. However, if for micro-plasmas this technique maybe not sensitive enough if species density is not high to obtain a distinct absorbance signal.\nThe sensitivity of absorption measurements is strongly dependent on the stability of used light source. Various types of light sources, narrow-band or broadband with wavelength range from VUV to mid-infrared, are applied together with high spectral resolution detection system such as spectrometer or FTIR. AS by laser light sources, particularly tunable diode-lasers or quantum cascade lasers are attractive light sources have been applied to measure species densities in micro-plasmas [8, 79,80]. These laser sources output specific wavelengths of large absorption cross-sections and enable fine scan of wavelength to obtain a clear absorption line profile, and from which species density and even gas temperature are able to be derived.\nWavelength selectivity is important in the implementation of AS technique as absorption may overlap by multi-species. And, it should be mentioned that absorption measurements yield line-integrated densities and spatial distribution is achievable by Abel inversion. Special efforts are required for non-uniform micro-plasmas by AS approach, since gas temperature and species density are spatially dependent. In this case broadband absorption can provide more details for deriving both the gas temperature and species density [81,82]. An example of OH density determination by broadband UV absorption in an atmospheric-pressure pin-to-water discharge is depicted in Figure 5 [83].\nAnother quite sensitive approach by using a cavity of two highly reflective mirrors is the cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) [84]. The laser pulse goesand-back in the cavity and that effectively enhances the absorption path length in the probed gas sample by several orders of magnitude. The time-decay of light intensity leaking from the cavity depends on the reflectivity of mirrors and species density in the cavity. Based on that the species density is able to be obtained with the known mirror reflectivity. In addition to the high sensitivity, compared to absorption spectroscopy, CRDS is independent on fluctuations of light intensity since a time constant rather than an absolute absorbance is measured. More details of CRDS technique are included in Refs. [84][85][86][87][88][89][90].\n\nSummary\nHigh-end diagnostic techniques have been applied to atmospheric-pressure plasmas. Even for highly transient non-uniform micro-plasmas, reliable insights of discharge properties are able to be achieved. This chapter includes several important advanced diagnostic approaches specifically for plasma parameters and reactive plasma species. Two approaches are suggested for a same diagnostic purpose, for example, the determination of gas temperature or electron density, and compared to ensure and increase the measurement accuracy, particularly for atmospheric-pressure plasmas. Other important plasma properties, such as densities of ion species and ion flux, surface charges, have been investigated as well and related diagnostic techniques can be found in above (review) references.

Defined.\nTerm leisure Definition: The portion of time workers and other people spend not being compensative for work performed when they actively engaged in the production of goods and services. In other words, this is the time people sent off the job. Leisure activities can include resting at home, working around the house (without compensation), engaging in leisure activities (such as weekend sports, watching movies), or even sleeping. Leisure time pursuits becomes increasingly important for economies as they become more highly developed. As technological advances reduce the amount of time people need to spend working to generate a given level of income, they have more freedom to pursue leisure activities.

All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, unless otherwise specified.\nThe plant parts of A. distichum including flower, leaf and branch were collected at Jangyyeon-myeon Goesan-gun Korea. Five hundred grams of fresh parts was extracted with 1,000 mL of 80% methanol with shaking for 24 h. The methanol-soluble fraction was filtered and concentrated to approximately 20 mL volume using a vacuum evaporator and a fraction was placed in a separating funnel. The ethyl acetate fraction was separated from the mixture, evaporated by a vacuum evaporator and prepared aseptically and kept in a refrigerator until use.\nMouse macrophage cell line, RAW264.7 cells was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin. The cells were maintained 37\u2103 under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Ethyl acetate fraction from A. distichum (EAFAD) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and then treated to cells. DMSO was used as a vehicle and the final DMSO concentration was no exceeded 0.1% (v/v).\nRAW264.7 cells were plated in 12-well plate for overnight. Cells were pre-treated with the extracts at the indicated concentrations for 2 h and then co-treat with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for the additional 18 h. After 18 h, 200 \u03bcL of the media was mixed with equal amount of Griess reagent (1% sulfanilamide and 0.1% N-1-(naphthyl) ethylenediamine-diHCl in 2.5% H3PO4). The mixture was incubated for the additional 5 min at the room temperature and the absorbance was measured at 540 nm.\nTotal RNA was prepared using a RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and total RNA (1 \u03bcg) was reverse-transcribed using a Verso cDNA Kit (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol for cDNA synthesis. PCR was carried out using PCR Master Mix Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) with primers for mouse iNOS and mouse GAPDH as follows: mouse iNOS: forward 5\u2019-gtgctgcctctggtcttgcaagc-3\u2019, and reverse 5\u2019-agggg caggctgggaattcg-3\u2019, mouse GAPDH: forward 5\u2019-caggagcgag accccactaacat-3\u2019 and reverse 5\u2019-gtcagatccacgacggacacatt-3\u2019.\nNuclear and cytosolic fractions were prepared following the manufacturer's protocols of nuclear extract kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Briefly, RAW264.7 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS containing phosphatase inhibitors and harvested with 1xhypotonic buffer for 15 min at 4\u2103. After adding detergent, the cells were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min and then the supernatants were collected as cytoplasmic fraction. Nuclear fractions were collected by suspending nuclear pellet with lysis buffer and centrifugation.\nCells were washed with 1 \u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Boston Bio Products, Ashland, MA, USA) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma Aldrich) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma Aldrich), and centrifuged at 12,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4\u2103. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. The proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were blocked for non-specific binding with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1h at room temperature and then incubated with specific primary antibodies in 5% nonfat dry milk at 4\u2103 overnight. After three washes with TBS-T, the blots were incubated with horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated immunoglobulin G (IgG) for 1 h at room temperature and chemiluminescence was detected with ECL Western blotting substrate (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized in Polaroid film.\nTransient transfection was performed using PolyJet DNA transfection reagent (SignaGen Laboratories, Ijamsville, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Briefly, RAW264.7 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and incubated overnight. Then, plasmid mixtures containing 1 \u03bcg of pNF-\u03baB-Luc plasmid and 0.1 \u03bcg of pRL-null vector were transfected for 24 h. After transfection, cells were pre-treated with the extracts for 2 h and then co-treated with LPS for an additional 15 h. The cells were harvested in 1 x luciferase lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was measured and normalized to the pRL-null luciferase activity using a dual-luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).\nA statistical analysis was performed with the Student\u2019s unpaired t-test, with statistical significance set at * P < 0.05.\nUnder stimulation, macrophages-generated NO plays an important role in inflammatory response. Thus, we used the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 cells for evaluating anti-inflammatory effect of the part of A. distichum. To determine if the parts of A. distichum could reduce NO generation by LPS, RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with the extracts from the parts of A. distichum (EAFAD) for 2 h and then co-treated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for the additional 18 h. As shown in Fig. 1, treatment of LPS without EAFAD induced NO overproduction in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, while pretreatment of all EAFADs suppressed LPS-mediated NO overproduction. Among EAFADs, the inhibitory effect of NO production was highest in the treatment of EAFAD-L (extracts from the leaf of A. distichum). Thus, we chose EAFAD-L for further studies.\nFig. 1Effect of EAFAD on NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. RAW264.7 cells were pre-treated with EAFAD at the indicated concentrations for 2 h and then co-treated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for the additional 18 h. After treatment, NO production was measured using the media and Griess reagent. DMSO was used as a vehicle. Values given are the mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3). *p < 0.05 compared to LPS treatment without EAFAD. EAFAD-F, EAFAD-L and EAFAD-B means the ethyl acetate fraction from the flower (EAFAD-L), leaf (EAFAD-L) and branch (EAFAD-B) of A. distichum.\nSince NO production is regulated by iNOS expression, the effect of EAFAD-L on iNOS expression was evaluated by Western blot and RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1A, LPS overexpression was detected in the cells stimulated LPS alone. However, EAFAD-L inhibited iNOS expression in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. For the further study for evaluating whether inhibitory effect of EAFAD-L against the expression of iNOS protein is mediated from regulating iNOS transcription, we also determined the mRNA level of iNOS regulated by EAFAD-L in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, the treatment of EAFAD-L attenuated the mRNA expression of iNOS. These data indicates that EAFAD-L may reduce iNOS expression through suppressing iNOS transcription.\nFig. 2Effect of EAFAD-L on iNOS expression in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. For Western blot (A), cells were pre-treated with indicated concentrations of EAFAD-L for 2 h and then co-treated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for an additional 15 h. DMSO was used as a vehicle. Cell lysates (30 \u03bcg) were resolved by 10% SDS\u2013PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with antibodies against iNOS. The proteins were then visualized using ECL detection. \u03b2-actin was used as an internal control. For RT-PCR (B), cells were pre-treated with indicated concentrations of EAFAD-L for 2 h and then co-treated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for an additional 15 h. Total RNA was isolated and RT-PCR was performed for iNOS. GAPDH was used as an internal control for RT-PCR.\nTo elucidate the effect of EAFAD-L on NF-\u03baB activation, we firstly carried out a Western blot for I\u03baB-\u03b1 degradation in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, LPS induced I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation and subsequent I\u03baB-\u03b1 degradation at 15 min after the stimulation. However, pretreatment of EAFAD-L blocked LPS-induced I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation in a dose-dependent manner.\nFig. 3.Inhibitory effect of EAFAD-L against NF-\u03baB activation. (A, B) Cells were pre-treated with indicated concentrations of EAFAD-L for 2 h, and then co-treated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for an additional 15 min (for Western blot of I\u03baB-\u03b1 and p-I\u03baB-\u03b1) or 30 min (for Western blot of p65).
