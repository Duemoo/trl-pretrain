The three people spoke to USA TODAY Sports on the condition of anonymity since they were not authorized to speak publicly due to ongoing negotiations.\nThe proposal instead includes a sliding scale of compensation, with players earning the most taking the biggest cuts and those earning the least receiving most of their guaranteed salaries.\nIt remains uncertain how much money the players will be yielding in this proposal, based on no fans in attendance for an 82-game season, after already agreeing to be paid on a pro-rated basis, reducing their pay by almost 50%.\nYet revenue sharing was not referenced at all in the document that was prepared for the union.\nThe union was concerned that the revenue sharing would lead to the introduction of a salary cap in future negotiations, while wary of further pay reductions, including the possibility of a percentage of their salaries placed in escrow.\nThe owners insist they will lose money during the regular season without fans in attendance, but would be guaranteed $777 million in postseason TV revenue, which would be inflated to about $1 billion with the postseason format expanded to 14 teams instead of 10.\nThere\u2019s no hard deadline for the negotiations to be completed, but the two sides would likely need to reach an agreement in seven to 10 days if the season can begin the first week of July.<|endoftext|>It\u2019s time to meet the boys of Riverdale.

However, the pandemic may affect adversely the Group's ability to implement its planned development programmes for the coming year - whether due to logistical challenges, such as the curtailment of international flights; the unavailability of mining personnel, equipment or materials or governmental restrictions which may be imposed in any of the jurisdictions in which the Group it operates.

Many opportunities are presented in the form of old underground gold mines which can be re-opened, a process with which the Company's Management team has substantial experience.\n\u00b7 the overall cost to reopen is far cheaper per ounce than new ounces at the same grade.\nSouth Korea is a modern, industrialised economy, a representative democracy and has substantial infrastructure advantages, in many respects, superior to western jurisdictions. South Korea is an investment grade country with Moodys and Standard & Poors ratings of AA and Aa2 respectively.\nThe past year has seen the farm-in arrangement with Southern Gold completed and South Korean joint ventures established for each of the two projects. BMV operates both the Gubong Project Company and the Geochang[1] Project Company.\nTo the end of December 2019, the Company had incurred USD 1,405,778 of farm-in expenditure. These costs were expensed through the Company's consolidated income statement, in line with accounting policies, and were a requirement for the formation of the Gubong and Kochang joint ventures with Southern Gold Ltd.\nThe project is just over one hour's drive west of Daejeon, the second largest city in South Korea. Access to the site is by sealed roads to within 100 metres of the old mine. Other infrastructure such as power and telecommunications are also placed conveniently.\nGubong was South Korea's second largest gold producer historically and the largest during 1930-1943, during the Japanese occupation. It still retains substantial remnant ore between mined blocks and excellent exploration potential. Mine data indicates good potential for mine re-commissioning and the possibility of relatively early cash flow.\nThere is a dearth of information considering the age of the mine and there is anecdotal evidence that the information relating to gold production is understated as there was little government control over the Japanese mining companies.\nThere are no declared JORC resource estimates currently at Gubong.\nThe immediate Gubong project area hosts five historical underground mines with the largest being the Gubong mine which exploited high grade quartz veins hosted in gneissic granite and mined to a vertical depth of approximately 500 metres.\nHistoric underground sampling results of the deeper levels of Vein 6, the main vein exploited at Gubong, gives an arithmetic uncut average of 30.6 g/t gold from 146 values. Exploratory core drilling below the now abandoned mine workings from one of five holes returned 27.9 g/t gold and 25 g/t silver over 1.6 metres downhole from 845.2 metres. This demonstration of the persistence with depth of the most developed mineralised structure supports the prospectivity of the property for auriferous shoots with considerable depth continuity.\nInterestingly, Vein 6 was found as a blind vein in the hanging wall during mine development work on the other veins. This suggests substantial gold resources may be found in parallel vein systems that do not outcrop in the area.\nThere has been no physical work undertaken at Gubong in the period to 31 December 2019. An application for a \"Permit to Develop\" the mine was submitted in late December 2018. The process was supposed to have taken 2 months however, the Provincial Government took a lot longer to review the submission and in May decided to defer the decision to a higher authority. The committee appointed to review the submission sat for a final decision on 30 August 2019 and issued their approval of the \"Permit to Develop\" on 10 September 2019.\nThe Kochang Mine began in 1928 but production records started in 1938 with the Nippon Mining Co which mined until 1942. Production restarted in 1961 and was fairly constant until 1975.\nThe workings extend over 1.2-1.5 km (2.5 km including the silver shaft area) from south west to north east and extend down dip to about 120 m below surface. The workings exploit 5-7 veins striking 050o with a dip of 50-70NW. There seem to have been 4 shafts (North shaft, south shaft, main shaft and silver shaft). The gold and silver mines have been worked as separate mines in the past but recent work suggests that they are part of the same deposit and that resources may extend between them.\nFollowing the last year of recorded production in 1975, exploratory level development was carried out in 1981 and 1990, presumably by KORES. Korean underground plans dated 1990 show the results of the sampling of quartz veins along portions of the gold mine at Kochang. In aggregate, a total of 104 underground samples are depicted with gold results ranging from 0.4 g/t up to 102.6 g/t for sample widths ranging from 0.03 metres to 0.6 metres in thickness. The length weighted average value of all the underground samples is 17.05 g/t gold over 0.2 metres.\nOf further interest is a particularly well mineralised 120 metre length of Vein 3 at the southern end of the prospecting drive on 245RL which gave a length weighted average value of 57.27 g/t gold over a 0.29 metre width: indicating the presence of higher grade ore shoots at Kochang. Bonanza grades were reportedly mined from upper levels of the north shaft vein.\nIn 1984, four inclined core holes were drilled at Kochang, but their coordinates are generally unknown. Each hole intersected narrow quartz veins. Two of the holes were sampled for assay over intersections of interest. One drill hole 84-2 was collared in a new deposit called the Sanpo Mine at 238 RL, azimuth of 225 and dip 70. Of the nine results reported, Hole 84-2 gave two intersections above 1 g/t gold in one hole. The intersections were 10.6 g/t gold and 12 g/t silver over 0.6 metres from 26.9 metres and 17.6 g/t gold and 4 g/t silver over 2.5 metres from 63.0 metres respectively. At 97.6 metres a 2.4m vein gave trace gold and 1,763 g/t silver.\nThis drill hole opens up a \"new\" parallel mineralised structure of up to 2.5m wide to be explored and the possibility of other as yet unknown structures related to the same hydrothermal fluid source and regional structures.\nThe Company continued to examine and explore the underground workings and surrounding area, locating previously unknown adits to the east of the mine.

Meanwhile, the battery pack comply with FCC and CE certified testing standards, let you use with worry free.\nSmall size generators are a good way to recover power when the energy power supply stops working. A portable generator gives crucial power back-up at these locations. It is essential to recognize how to select a portable generator because it requires comprehending some electrical terms like wattage as well as voltage.\nA portable generator is not ideal for high energy-consuming appliances like electric furnaces.An internet site that sells this kind of generator also gives electrical power calculator. A 3000-4000 watts generator is sufficient for a tiny residence that needs to run 3-4 lights, TV, fridge as well as microwave. There is no need to get a higher electrical power generator than exactly what is needed due to the fact that it will certainly take in more fuel.\nSuch generators typically give 10 hrs of continual power on a complete tank. A generator that gives maximum hrs of power using minimum amount of fuel need to be picked since the reoccuring expense of gasoline is the most significant cost included in running a generator.\nThese generators have little wheels near the bottom so it is easy to lug them anywhere. At the same time, some greater electrical power generators are hefty and also can not be transferred to an additional place by one individual. Then the weight as well as transportability of the generator ought to be checked, if the generator will certainly be used at camping or building website.\nSome portable generators are not developed to run sensitive electronic devices like computer systems. These generators generate rising and fall current that is all right for general appliances but not appropriate for tools that need constant stable power. For running delicate devices like computers, an inverter generator ought to be used.\nIn a lot of suburbs, there are strict council and also structure legislations associated to the generator sound degree. Much less noisy generator is also much less annoying for the customers. Portable generators are offered in quiet varieties also yet these systems set you back extra. These are some crucial variables to think about when acquiring this type of generator. All generators provide the very same conventional 120V and usually have a solitary electrical outlet. Circuitry is required to take power from this outlet as well as send to multiple electrical outlets.\nHow many watts do you need for a portable power generator?\nThis is certainly a really important question that most people have when they go to buy a generator. It all is determined by exactly what your requirements are for the devices that you want to operate. If the goal to obtain a power generator will be to continue to keep your refrigerator or freezer working in the event of an electrical power outage or to just power your tv or laptop then a lower wattage model might be acceptable. If you would like run a number of items simultaneously or maybe operate power tools and air conditioning systems then you definitely will want to check out an electrical generator with a higher wattage.

This study found that the level of crop water stress could be easily calculated using CWSIEE with only air and canopy temperature data.\nIn this study, we estimated soil moisture values using the Deep Neural Network(DNN) scheme at the mountainous regions. In order to test the sensitive analysis of DNN scheme, we collected the measured(at the soil depths of 10 cm and 30 cm) soil moisture and DNN input(weather and land surface) data at the Pyeongchang-gun(relatively flat) and Geochang-gun(steep slope) sites. Our findings indicated that the soil moisture estimates were sensitive to the weather variables(5 days-averaged rainfall, 5 days precedent rainfall, accumlated rainfall) and DEM. These findings showed that the DEM and weather variables play the key role in the processes of soil water flow at the mountainous regions. We estimated the soil moisture values at the soil depths of 10 cm and 30 cm using DNN at two study sites under different climate-landsurface conditions. The estimated soil moisture(R: 0.890 and RMSE: 0.041) values at the soil depth of 10 cm were comparable with the measured data in Pyeongchang-gun site while the soil moisture estimates(R: 0.843 and RMSE: 0.048) at the soil depth of 30 cm were relatively biased. The DNN-based soil moisture values(R: 0.997/0.995 and RMSE: 0.014/0.006) at the soil depth of 10 cm/30 cm matched well with the measured data in Geochang-gun site. Although uncertainties exist in the results, our findings indicated that the DNN-based soil moisture estimation scheme demonstrated the good performance in estimating soil moisture values using weather and land surface information at the monitoring sites. Our proposed scheme can be useful for efficient land surface management in various areas such as agriculture, forest hydrology, etc.\nAlthough there have been a lot of efforts to improve water quality in the estuarine reservoir, overall the water quality problems of the estuarine reservoirs remain. So, it is essential to establish water quality management plans under a comprehensive understanding of the environmental characteristics of the estuarine reservoir. Therefore, in this study, a resilience analysis framework for evaluating the estuarine reservoir\u2019s water quality was suggested for improving existing assessment method for water quality management plan. First, as a result of analyzing the static resilience to each scenario, it was found that from the S3 scenario in which dredging was conducted considerably, the resilience of about 30% more than the current estuarine reservoir system was restored. Second, as a result of analyzing the dynamic resilience, if cost and time are considered, there is no significant difference in robustness and resourcefulness, so it can be seen that the resilience of the estuarine reservoir can be efficiently improved by simply performing dredging up to the level of Scenario 3. Finally, as a result of comparing static and dynamic resilience, since static resilience is only presented as a single value, the differences and characteristics of the resilience capacity of the estuarine reservoir might be overlooked only by the static resilience analysis. However, in the aspect that it is possible to interpret the internal recovery capacity of the estuarine reservoir in multiple ways with various indicators (robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness, rapidity), evaluating water quality based on dynamic resilience analysis is useful.<|endoftext|>As with previous generations, the Gary Fong Lightsphere\u00ae Collapsible Speed Mount will continue to provide photographers with the ability to achieve studio-style lighting effects, anywhere at anytime.

In order to accomplish this, we first need to look at the challenges we face when connecting people to things.\nIn today\u2019s world, it is has become commonplace for users to use their personal devices to connect them to resources in the organisation. These devices include laptops, mobile devices, IP cameras, printers, and more.\nThe organisation faces a challenge in both allowing the end-user to connect securely and providing access to data that is secured. BYOD or Bring Your Own Device is here to stay and in order to ensure that users can actually bring their own devices and be secure, we need to look at a number of things.\nOrganisations can use the 802.1x protocol to allow users to connect their devices securely. This ensures that only authenticated users are actually allowed to connect to the corporate network. This protocol suite will determine the identity of the user or device being connected, and then according to configured policies it will place the user in the appropriate network.\nUsers who work remotely can connect to an organisation\u2019s resources using a VPN connection. In fact, even if users connect to a public internet network from home, it is encouraged that they make use of VPN software to keep their connection secure.\nOrganisations and end-users should make use of a firewall to protect their access to the internet. Firewalls protect organisations and users from malicious attackers who wish to gain access to corporate or personal endpoints/devices. The firewall is your corporate network\u2019s, or your home computer\u2019s, defense perimeter.\nMaking use of a VPN connection and a firewall isn\u2019t always enough to secure a user\u2019s access to a network. So how do we ensure that any kind of authentication over any network is done in a secure manner? Authentication involves a user sending their username and password across a public or private transport medium to a destination network where they are authenticated.\nWhen users connect to an organisation\u2019s network or to a public network, there is a risk that their user credentials might become compromised. To this end, users need to use secure passwords for their accounts which need to be at least 8 characters in length. These passwords should be a mix of alphanumeric characters and symbols. Even though a secure password is configured, this may not necessarily provide a 100% secure authentication experience.\nSo what happens when a secure password is not enough? The solution to this problem comes in the form of Multi Factor Authentication or 2FA (Two Factor Authentication). This involves a user entering a password and then performing a secondary authentication process whereby the user provides a code from an app on their mobile device, a biometric scan, or a physical security token.\nWhether you are a corporate user or just using your devices for personal use, MFA can secure access to your applications. Using your mobile device, you can, for example, download an authenticator app and use it as an additional layer of security when accessing data. But what about the actual device\u2019s security? How do we know that the device we are using is actually safe to use?\nEven though users can connect securely using various methods such as 802.1x, VPNs, MFA, etc. there is still the risk that a device might be compromised in some way. Every day people use the Internet to access various resources. People copy files from one device to another, and often do so with little regard for how safely these actions are performed. An unsuspecting user could click on a malicious link in a website and suddenly find that their device is infected with malware or a virus.\nEndpoint devices must be secured with an endpoint security product. In an organisation, these endpoints are usually centrally managed and administrators can easily identify vulnerable endpoints and take action. Sophisticated endpoint security product suites should prevent the exploitation, infection or tampering of connected devices. Once we have secured our devices, how do we protect the confidentiality of our data?\nWhen storing sensitive data on an endpoint, it is vital that we store that data securely and protect the data\u2019s confidentiality. Data encryption can be used for this purpose. Several products on the market specialise in data encryption and many operating systems often come with built-in data encryption software. External storage devices can be encrypted if the device is moved from one place to another.\nWe have seen how users can protect their endpoints in many different ways, whether this is taken care of by an organisation\u2019s administrator or by the user on their personal devices at home.\nSecure connections using protocols such as 802.1x, VPN software typically with an active firewall on the device.\nSecure authentication with strong passwords and Multi Factor Authentication.\nSecure devices using endpoint protection software suites for Anti-Virus and Antimalware.\nSecuring data on devices using data encryption software.\nMy name is Pieter du Plooy.

Funny enough, she is also fast in catching on to trends and new things. After visiting the fan\u2019s house, her mother asked about BTS and how she\u2019s seen them all over the news. The fan began to explain who the group was while her mother took out her phone and took detailed notes.\nAfter note-taking, her mother asked for some videos of the group. As soon as legendary clips of BTS came on the screen, her mother whipped out her phone and started comparing the notes to the video, trying to memorize who is who.\nThe fan took her mother\u2019s phone to take a look and this is what she found: A whole list of the member\u2019s names, ages, and traits.\nRM (Kim Nam Joon) 25 years old. In charge of English speaking. Rapper. Lyricist and producer. Charisma from Ilsan.\nJin (Kim Seok Jin) 27 years old. Worldwide handsome. Good looking oldest member. From Gyeonggido Gwacheon.

Good and singing and dancing. Has a pretty line when dancing.\nJungkook (Jeon Jungkook) 22 years old. Main vocal. Has great thighs. Golden maknae. Jack of all trades as he can sing, dance, do sports as well as shoot film. He is a bit shy but totally changes once on stage.\nHer mother spent a total of two hours studying BTS before going back home. She also confirmed that her bias was J-Hope that day as well.\nThe next day she received a text from her mom.\nMom: The mic is supposed to drop at the end of the video but why doesn\u2019t that part show?\nMom: What are the main points of \u201cDNA?\u201d Who rocks this video?\nFan: The whistle sound.

Bidding began at 1.5 billion won (US$1.23 million) each but ended with zero bids.\nGilt-bronze Standing Buddha, dating back to the middle of the 7th century during the period of Unified Silla (668-918), was designated as South Korea's Treasure No. 284 in 1963. Standing in an imposing posture, its height reaches 38 centimeters, larger than any other gilt-bronze Buddhist statue manufactured during the Silla period.\nGilt-bronze Standing Bodhisattva, which was made between the 6th and 7th centuries during the Silla period, was designated as Treasure No. 285 in 1963. The 19-cm-high statue was discovered in Geochang, southeast South Korea.\nKansong Art Museum was founded by Korean businessman Jeon Hyeong-pil (1906-1962) in 1938, initially with the name Bohwagak, during the Japanese occupation of the Korean Peninsula.\nWednesday was the first time that the Seoul-based private museum had put up part of its collection for auction. The auction plan reportedly came due to the museum's financial hardship.\nAmid concerns of overseas purchases, some cultural heritage experts have called for the National Museum of Korea (NMK) to use state coffers to buy and preserve the two treasures at home.\nNMK representatives reportedly reached out to Kansong for a private sale, but the latter insisted on holding a public auction to respect potential bidders.\nObservers predict that the Kansong museum will put the items, along with other treasures in its possession, back on auction in the near future.<|endoftext|>Hi My English is not very good, I hope you can understand.\nI use 5D Mark iv with canon 70-200 f2.8 is iii usm to photograph birds I found that 200 mm Not enough for shooting birds at all So I think I need to get a super telephoto lens for bird photography, but I had a hard time deciding with these two lens.\nIf I decide from price 120-300 definitely win, but I want to buy these high-priced lenses first time and last time But I think 120-300 will be more flexible to use but in my opinion The lens is designed to be used at 300mm.

Since 2004, more than $75 million of capital has poured into these new dairy startups pioneered by New Zealand dairy investors partnered with locals. This system is profitable and environmentally sustainable. Further growth and diffusion of this model is hampered by a shortage of skilled grazing dairy managers in the U.S. One method used extensively in New Zealand to overcome this human resource barrier is the concept of sharemilking as the first stage of a dairyman\u2019s career path. Careful alignment of interests via sharemilking contracts provides a means to overcome barriers to entry for younger and minority dairymen while overcoming management shortages for existing dairies. This proposal seeks to fund workshops and the development of a sharemilker\u2019s web-based resource featuring sample sharemilking contracts, decision tools, educational resources and case studies.<|endoftext|>For I\u2019m told I\u2019m made of you and that you are of me.\nOh Universe, I beg you, Awaken me please.\nFor K\u0101la churns forward and my locks show grays.\nOh Universe, an end to this cycle of decrepit ends is for which I obsess.\nWhy prepare me for greatness, then one day end me in a glance?\nOh Universe, you allure the ego with blandishments, keeping the secret of eternal bliss untold?\nThis mind yearns to know the unknown, where the \"I\" and the \"me\" are left unsaid.\nOh Universe, will you dissolve this self in Unity and grant Divine Insight?\nHarmonious Universe, what is the purpose of this life?\nWhen vision is clouded by Maya, and the soul's vessel ravaged by karmic strife.\nOh Universe, why is life\u2019s journey a treacherously torturous twist?\nAlluring Universe, why build lofty castles in the sky?\nWhen spring\u2019s flowers will surely wither and in autumn leaves run dry.\nOh Universe, will you show me The Path to Nirvana at last, forsooth?<|endoftext|>Nation Current Affairs 11 Jul 2019 CBI raids premises o...\nNew Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday carried out raids at the premises of notable lawyers Indira Jaising and her husband Anand Grover husband in connection with the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) violation case.\nThe searches were at the Delhi and Mumbai offices of their NGO and homes as well, the police said.

I thought the environment and students of CWNU are outstanding when I looked at it as the president of Geochang Provincial College. I ran for the election to develop CWNU more, using those conditions. So, it turned out to be a good result.\nQ. I anticipate a future of university administrations because you have lots of administrative experiences. Could you introduce to us how you will lead the school?\nChoi: I would like to lead student-centered university administrations. Making students people who are helpful to a community is important. We can overcome the present university\u2019s problems if we do this because the university is related with communities in every way. Anyway, I\u2019d like to make our school to the central university in Gyeongnam.\nQ. How would you get close to students?\nChoi: I would like to have a talk with regular students periodically more than executives. Our students are second to none but their family background is not good. For those students, I cared for a scholarship for their regular academic performances. The scholarship will be increased a little.\nQ. In these days, unemployment is a big issue not only for graduates but for other age groups. How can we get through these situations?\nChoi: I want to make people aware that CWNU has a higher employment rate by enhancing employment rate to 70% within a year. There are many enterprises around our university and I think it can solve unemployment. Among 3000 enterprises, we will sign MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) with 300 companies and one company can hire at least one person.\nQ. Many students\u2019 wish is an improvement of school cafeteria\u2019s menu quality. How would you figure out this problem?\nChoi: Students have told that lunch money is not expensive compared to other universities, but our school food quality is lower than others. I plan to resolve it within the school budget, not raising the cost. I\u2019m going to use the school cafeteria, too.\nQ. What do you think CWNU would be like after a four-year term?\nChoi: I want to see its standing as a national university from a local university. I\u2019ll try to foster the school for 4 years. Also, I like to see a growing school and will support it after my retirement.\nQ. Please leave a message to the students.\nChoi: Have a challenging spirit. Your dreams and hopes are endless. I believe it comes true as much as you set it and achieve it. However, you should increase your competitiveness and abilities at the same time because everything is made by efforts. If you can achieve it, I\u2019m sure our students will go to the world.<|endoftext|>The BEST WESTERN Hotel Rebstock, run by the same family for 3 generations, offers panoramic views of Lake Constance from the restaurant, spacious rooms with a balcony, free WiFi and free parking on site.

Today, I\u2019m absolutely GUSHING over Rachel McMillan\u2019s historical mystery and romance release, Murder at the Flamingo, with a review, interview with Rachel, BOOK RECOMMENDATIONS FROM HER, and a GIVEAWAY!\nRead on for more awesome bookish stuff!\nHamish DeLuca has spent most of his life trying to hide the anxiety that appears at the most inopportune times \u2014 including during his first real court case as a new lawyer. Determined to rise above his father\u2019s expectations, Hamish runs away to Boston where his cousin, Luca Valari, is opening a fashionable nightclub in Scollay Square. When he meets his cousin\u2019s \u201cright hand man\u201d Reggie, Hamish wonders if his dreams for a more normal life might be at hand.\nRegina \u201cReggie\u201d Van Buren, heir to a New Haven fortune, has fled fine china, small talk, and the man her parents expect her to marry. Determined to make a life as the self-sufficient city girl she\u2019s seen in her favorite Jean Arthur and Katharine Hepburn pictures, Reggie runs away to Boston, where she finds an easy secretarial job with the suave Luca Valari. But as she and Hamish work together in Luca\u2019s glittering world, they discover a darker side to the smashing Flamingo night club.\nWith Rachel McMillan\u2019s distinct historical voice and attention to detail, she paints a vivid historical mystery with a hint of romance against the backdrop of a brilliant 1930s Boston scene. In her distinct way, she makes the setting a secondary character of its own, vocal and important in its culture and story role. With a fabulous puzzle solved and room for more adventures to come, the city comes to life as the characters grapple with loyalty, independence, anxiety, and purpose.\nHamish and Reggie are endearing, quirky, enigmatic, and just plain lovable. Even secondary characters like Luca (whom you will dislike/love/want to hug all at once!) and Nate (and his wonderful candidness!) are sure to be favorites and promise to be even more essential in stories to come. And I just want to hang out with Reggie and watch films of the time!\nFans of McMillan\u2019s previous Herringford & Watts series will be ecstatic to learn of the \u201cnext\u201d generation (Hamish is a DeLuca, after all) and see tiny nods to the previous series and a familiar name or two!\nLet\u2019s stop right here and talk about Hamish. He is SUCH a product of his parents! But, he is his own kind of special, quirky, and important. Through his unique viewpoint, Rachel McMillan illustrates the challenges of mental illness \u2014 namely anxiety and panic \u2014 in a normalizing and emphatic way. This makes him wonderfully relatable \u2014 even for a reader with no personal experience with such challenges (like myself). I applaud her for using characterization to subtly bring awareness and empathy to the forefront in a way that adds so much to the story.\nI could talk all day about more wonderful elements of this story \u2014 lemon cannolis, bicycles, jazz, picture shows, DANCES, light bulbs, classic literature, and an implied message of grace. Instead, I hope you choose to discover for yourself all the intricacies and fun of this little mystery.\nI cannot wait to see where these beloved characters will take me next!\nMANY thanks to Thomas Nelson for the review copy.\nPick one: lemon sandwich or lemon cannoli?\nAHHH this is so hard. I am going to say cannoli.\nWhat\u2019s next for this set of characters?\nMurder in the City of Liberty releases next May and it finds Hamish and Reggie two years after they open Van Buren and DeLuca investigations/legal consulting/Winchester Molloy listening, in 1940. There are two major forces in this book: the first is a black baseball player and fastest base stealer in the Boston farm leagues who becomes the target of a series of horrible pranks that eventually lead to murder. The second is a growing racism (specifically anti-Semitism) which aligns with the conflict in Europe (for which Hamish\u2019s home country is already fighting). Very much like The White Feather Murders, I wanted explore the lack of social justice and the rampant prejudice heightened during war time. On a personal front, Reggie and Hamish are doing a very poor job of being \u201cjust friends.\u201d And Nate gets a little bit of romance of his own!\nMurder at the Flamingo incorporates a character with panic and anxiety when mental illness was taboo for the era. And, you have started a related hashtag #FictionForEmpowerment. Tell us more about that!\nYes! It is something that I have lived with my entire life and I thought this was the perfect time to talk about it through a fictional lens: so all of the symptoms and challenges I ascribe to Hamish are things I have struggled with since childhood. Mental illness is very much like any other illness \u2014except it is invisible. So while, not unlike someone with cancer or diabetes, I have to see a doctor regularly and use medicinal treatment to live a full life, it is not something that is completely easy for everyone to understand. In Hamish DeLuca\u2019s time, there were still rather primitive ideas about it and studies that found patients being doled all manner of horrible mercury pills (that ravaged the system), being locked in sanitariums or exposed to shock treatment. Because of Hamish\u2019s visible symptoms, these are things that are very real threat to him. I wanted to show that a character who suffers from this illness still has adventures and tries to get the girl: even though he had a steeper hill to climb in terms of acceptance than we do nowadays, he still is just a human being. At heart, this series works to normalize mental illness without hopefully ever being slated as \u201cissue\u201d fiction. (For Herringford and Watts readers of The White Feather Murders, you will recognize that Hamish comes by his right hand tremor genetically. Something his father had since the end of A Lesson in Love and Murder).\nI loved writing all of them. Just like in Herringford and Watts: they all mean so much to me. I gave Reggie all my qu"

Any disorder can put a decent amount of stress and on any human being, this does not mean that shutting that person out of your life forever will help solve the problem; because it will simple not help anyone. What any person should do in a situation that has a loved one with a disorder like this would be to first identify one hundred percent that the person truly has the symptoms and signs of the disorder. Then seek medical help and learn as much information as one can possibly do. Even if there is a treatment, but it will not cure the person completely it will benefit everyone in the long run because it will make life simpler and it will not put so much stress on loved ones and they can lead a happy, fulfilling life. A documentary on the Oprah Winfrey Show that can also be found on YouTube of a girl with schizophrenia named January \u201cJani\u201d Schofield was diagnosed with this disorder at the age of six years old in 2009. Since Jani was showing the signs of schizophrenia they had to take her out of school when she was in the first grade. Because Jani did not have the right social skill to be around other children and then at times Jani would be too much of a handful for her teachers and they would spend more attention and energy on her and not the other students. Slowly, her parents put her back in to the school system, but it was not with other children and she did not go...... middle of paper......t mean the hallucinations will go away for good, it will simply control the delusions and hallucinations. If a schizophrenic is unable to take medication or chooses not to take it, there is another option. They can do, it is called a cognitive behavioral therapy. \u201cReporting Feb. 6 in The Lancet, British researchers say that the treatment can help ease patients' psychotic symptoms and boost their personal and social functioning\u201d (Robert Preidt February 2014). For a schizophrenic to go to therapy will help them accomplish everyday tasks such as, cooking, cleaning, and everyday grooming. Therapy will also encourage the patient to have weekly goals they can accomplish or working on their social skills with their friends and family and even people they work with. Giving them limits of what they can do so they do not feel so overwhelmed with everyday tasks can also help.<|endoftext|>Warning: The video contains graphic language.\nCharges will not be filed against a driver who was filmed driving through a group of Black Lives Matter demonstrators as they blocked lanes of traffic in Ventura earlier this month, prosecutors said Thursday.\nThe incident took place as protesters gathered at the intersection of Victoria Avenue and Telephone Road on June 7, according to a Ventura County District Attorney\u2019s Office news release.\nDuring the protest, a number of people went in the street, blocking two lanes of traffic and obstructing some vehicles, prosecutors said.\n\u201cTraffic continued to proceed through the intersection, and ultimately a low speed collision occurred between a white pick-up truck and two protestors standing in the roadway on northbound Victoria Avenue,\u201d the release stated.\nThe motorist drove away from the scene but contacted police and alerted them to the incident soon after, authorities said.\nWitnesses captured the events that transpired before, during and after the collision on video, and authorities used that, along with footage from traffic cameras in the area, in deciding there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to charge the driver, according to the DA\u2019s office.\nProsecutors said the motorist was acting in self-defense, noting that he had proceeded \u201cslowly and reasonably\u201d while the protesters were violating the California Vehicle Code.\nVideo of the incident showed the motorist slowing down as he encountered a group of demonstrators who were gathered in street and tried to motion them away with his hand.\nIn turn, they surrounded the pickup, which was moving slowly but did not stop as two people were in front of the vehicle, and began hitting it, according to the footage.\nOne of the demonstrators who was in physical contact with the front of the vehicle was pushed down to the ground as a result, according to prosecutors, citing the footage. He could be seen getting up and, along with several others, attempting to run after the truck as it sped off.\nA second protestor\u2019s foot was hit while she tried to move out of the way.\nOne suffered a broken ankle while the other was uninjured, according to authorities.\nThe incident happened amid a Black Lives Matter demonstration that began at the nearby Ventura County Government Center and drew about 1,500 people, the Ventura County Star reported.<|endoftext|>Particular the red flowers lit up with its color this time of year.

If you\u2019re curious (or even skeptical) about the effectiveness of affirmations, I invite you to read on to see how positive affirmations can impact your life for the better.\nIf you take a moment to think about all of the places your mind goes to in a day, you\u2019ll realize that there are both positive and negative things that you think (and speak) about. This means that affirmations can be either positive or negative. As we move through our lives, we develop thought processes that turn into belief systems. If we think of affirmations as being the same as thoughts, negative affirmations turn into negative belief systems, which can impact the way we perceive ourselves and our places in the world. For example, by repeatedly thinking, \u201cI\u2019m not good at writing,\u201d you ingrain in yourself the belief that you are not (and will never be) good at writing. In doing so, you cut yourself off from opportunities because you\u2019ve decided (through your self-talk) that you aren\u2019t good at it, and you might lose all hope of getting better. Many people suffer from these negative thought patterns that lead them into a downward spiral and block them from reaching their goals or enjoying their lives. One way to counteract these negative beliefs is by consciously changing the way we think. A concrete and effective way of doing this is by thinking and saying positive affirmations.\nPositive affirmations are a powerful way to stop negative thought patterns. When you think or speak a positive affirmation, it signals your subconscious mind that you are making a change and beginning to think about yourself and your life in a different way. Just like any process of change, it takes time and practice for these affirmations to sink in and \u201cstick\u201d as part of your thought pattern.\nThe effectiveness of positive affirmations in certain situations is backed up by science. A study recently published in Psychological Science explores the neurophysiological reactions that help explain how positive affirmations help people deal with threats to self-integrity. Another study by researchers from Carnegie Mellon University (published in PLOS ONE) determined that positive affirmations protect individuals against the negative effects of stress on problem-solving abilities. In addition to scientific research, there is a large body of anecdotal evidence that people feel more optimistic about certain aspects of their lives when they use positive affirmations.\nHow do I increase the effectiveness of my positive affirmations?\nThere are several things you can do to increase the effectiveness of positive affirmations. Saying the affirmations out loud gives them weight and signals your subconscious mind to take them seriously. To increase the effectiveness of positive affirmations, make a conscious decision to think positive thoughts throughout the day. Challenging yourself to find one positive thing about each situation also helps. At the end of your day, review everything you did, your conversations with people, your reactions, etc., and think of at least one positive thing that came out of it. These positive thoughts will \u201cprime\u201d your mind to accept the positive affirmations, thus making them more effective. When you dedicate yourself to this process, before long, you\u2019ll notice that you feel better and that you are able to approach life in a more positive and productive way.\nWhat are some examples of positive affirmations to try?\nThe great thing about positive affirmations is that they can be tailored to your specific goals or general in nature. Here are some general affirmations you can try.\nI listen to my inner wisdom.\nWonderful"

The darkly ambient pop group, led by singer-songwriter Greg Gonzalez, has been gaining traction since their self-titled debut in 2017, and when you combine that sound with an on-brand, highly personable social media presence, you\u2019ve got yourself a buzz-worthy band that has staying power in today\u2019s world of fleeting indie successes. For their follow-up, CRY, the group voyaged to the Spanish Island of Mallorca to record the nine tracks, and it\u2019s a vibe\u2014at this point, if Cigarettes After Sex has one thing going for them, it\u2019s vibes. Oh god, I can\u2019t believe I actually just typed that.\nIn fact, many comparisons can be made between the two albums. And it goes far beyond the phenomena of some insufferable hipster groaning \u201cAll of their songs sound the sameeee,\u201d complete with a five-minute eye-roll. The truth is, the two albums sound remarkably similar. Those who have committed their entire discography to memory (re: me) should be able to distinguish which track belongs to which album, but even then, it\u2019s hard. I actually have to give credit to Gonzalez for being able to keep track of all these songs that sound the same. If Cigarettes After Sex has introduced a new color to their world of charcoal and ash, its a barely discernible taupe. But the dilemma? It still sounds so good. Sonically, CRY is painting with 50 shades of grey.\nNow for the bad news: Lyrically, CRY is painting with FIFTY SHADES OF GREY.\nIn a piece for Talkhouse, legendary French singer Francoise Hardy gushed over the band\u2019s sound, sharing that it was the music \u201cwhich I have been looking for all my life.\u201d However, she also revealed that she didn\u2019t understand the lyrics because she\u2019s not fluent in English, although she was \u201csure they are as inspired as the rest of the band\u2019s sound.\u201d The problem is: they\u2019re not. If one was to unlearn the English language and simply hear Gonzalez\u2019s dulcet vocals as a series of languid vowels, then what we have here is a gorgeous collection of melodies that few can criticize. But at times, the lyrics on CRY can really mess with\u2014you guessed it\u2014the album\u2019s vibe.\n\u201cKiss It Off Me\u201d is perhaps the worst offender: \u201cSaw you on the side of the road / I could see you walking slow, drinkin\u2019 a Slurpee / In\u2005a\u2005peach baseball cap, fallin\u2019\u2005in my lap / You were so thirsty.\u201d And then, as if things couldn\u2019t get any more awkward, Gonzalez follows up with \u201cKnow I make you forget / About all of those rich fuckboys.\u201d The lyrics break the gorgeous illusion the music creates, which seems to lend itself to more sophisticated subject matter. Another instance is \u201cHentai,\u201d in which Gonzalez regales a time when he told his lover about a hentai video he watched right before they had sex for the first time\u2026 For those of you not familiar with the term, it\u2019s anime porn, and while he never mentions it again, it makes you feel slimy for the rest of the song. Maybe even the rest of the day.\nPerhaps that\u2019s the entire point, the silly secret behind the group\u2019s virility and memorability. The lyrics of CRY, at best sickeningly sweet and at worst downright cringe-worthy, form an impression in a way that most indie guitar pop bands don\u2019t. Can you name a Beach Fossils lyric right off the top of your head? How about Real Estate? Wild Nothing? For better or for worse, Cigarettes After Sex\u2019s lyrics are easy to grasp onto, to get stuck in your head as you complete life\u2019s mundane activities.\nCRY shows no signs of evolution for Cigarettes After Sex, but then again, it never promised any. All it promises is a passionate one-night stand, a single evening on a stormy beach. A step into a monochromatic universe where rain isn\u2019t just rain, but the sky\u2019s lovelorn tears.<|endoftext|>NOTE: Conservation Sudbury is monitoring the guidance pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Most college football programs would love to be in that position.\nI\u2019m going to start with the good, but not going to dwell there because everyone already has hashed out exactly what they\u2019ve done.\nI\u2019m a big fan of \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d One scene in the last season reminds me of this Iowa State team. Without any spoilers, Rick and the gang are in a scuffle with a guy named Negan and his group of ruffians. At one point, Negan has Rick and his son, Carl, absolutely dead to rights with literally no visible or conceivable means of escape.\nKneeling and bound, Rick looks at this guy and says, \u201cI don\u2019t know how and I don\u2019t know when, but I will kill you.\u201d He had no reason to believe that he was going to win \u2014 or even survive, for that matter. But he had all the confidence in the world.\nThat is this Iowa State group (minus the zombies and people trying to murder you).\nNo matter what situation they find themselves in \u2014 throwing an interception and facing essentially first and goal with a one-score lead \u2014 they have no fear that they will be stuck in it.\nFollowing the Texas game, Iowa State coach Matt Campbell spoke to the media about needing to get more consistency from play to play across the board. They\u2019ve gotten that in spades. That\u2019s the strength of this team. They will never quit.\nThat patience, poise and confidence are exactly what gets other teams in trouble when they play Iowa State. The defense plays such a way that your underneath routes are available, but every play will be a checkdown and tackle. Every team ISU has played since employing this aggressively passive defense hasn\u2019t been able to stare eye-to-eye for the length of the game without getting greedy and falling flat.\nGenerally speaking, this unit is one of the best fitting and tackling units in the country. It\u2019s their soundness that makes them so good. Against TCU, Iowa State lost that soundness at times. Specifically, run plays that attacked the C-gap (between the tackle and tight end) were successful against the Cyclones' defense. These were the plays in the fourth quarter on their multiple drives that they got down in scoring position.\nIowa State lines up their defensive ends (when they\u2019re in their three-down front) on the inside shoulder of the offensive tackle. It may not seem like much, but when the gap TCU wants to exploit is outside of that man, it\u2019s an easier leverage point to get the end cut off, making the person responsible for that gap either an outside linebacker or safety. TCU did a good job at getting that person blocked as well, which left a lot of space for the ball-carrier to run through. Once they were in space, the tackling of the secondary was less stellar than it has been in weeks past. Other teams will notice this same deficiency, so getting that fixed will be an important step before the Mountaineers and Cowboys start rolling.\nI can say with full confidence that this is the best Cyclone team since the Dan McCarney era (including every team that I was on). The ceiling is the limit. Let\u2019s not let anything \u2014 Kirk Herbstreit tweets, top-25 rankings, ESPN's College GameDay or no GameDay, weather or rumors about college programs trying to hire away Campbell \u2014 take away from appreciating this group.\nThe Cyclones are in first place in the Big 12.\nJeff Woody is a former Iowa State football player and writes weekly Cyclones football analysis for Cyclone Insider during the season.<|endoftext|>How to Memorize Han Hwondang Kim Goengpil(\u5bd2\u6684\u5802 \u91d1\u5b8f\u5f3c) and Do-dong Seowon(\u9053\u6771\u66f8\u9662): Focusing on Chinese Poems Collected in Anthologies\n\nThis paper was written to examine descendents\u2019 views and memories on Han Hwondang Kim Goengpil and Do-dong Seowon in Hyeonpung, Daegu, which has enshrined him, by referencing to others\u2019 Chinese poems collected in anthologies. There remains no Kim Goengpil\u2019s anthologies, so only Gyeonghyeonrok(\u666f\u8ce2\u9304) may seem to be selected as a reference for him, but there are, however, few writings of him, and therefore, it is difficult to investigate his scholarly career and guarantee the objectivity of the contents collected in them, as there are a lot of literature regarding the post-evaluation for Chujeung(\u8ffd\u8d08) and Gajeung(\u52a0\u8d08). Hence, the Chinese poems collected in others\u2019 anthologies were examined to show that the birth and death dates of authors from the contemporary figures who directly interacted with Kim Goengpil to Myeon-u Gwak Jongseok who lived in the 20th century are evenly distributed, and that the subjects of Chinese poems recited primarily include the text of \u2018Sohak(\u5c0f\u5b78)\u2019 on which he concentrated his efforts for a life; Hapcheon and Geochang, in which he often stayed when he was young; Huicheon and Suncheon, in which he stayed twice due to Sahwa(\u53f2\u798d); and Hyeonpung in which Do-dong Seowon is placed. Main places recited in the Chinese poems include Sohakdang(\u5c0f\u5b78\u5802) and Jidongam(\u5fd7\u540c\u5dd6), the spaces used for the lectures conducted together with Jeong Yeochang in Hapcheon; Supodae(\u6c34\u7011\u81fa) in which he strolled about together with his sister\u2019s husbands, Choi Sukryang and Jeong Yeochang and Mohyeongjeong(\u6155\u8ce2\u4ead) which Choi Sukryang\u2019s decendents constructed to celebrate the meeting of them in Geochang; and the site in which an old house is located and Do-dong Seowon in Hyeonpung. In the process, the contemporary poetry and prose about Kim Goengpil were created by concentrating on grief and reverence for him who suffered from political vicissitudes, but shifted the authors\u2019 focus to the space of Do-dong Seowon, generation after generation, probably implying that the descendents regard Kim Goengpil as a past figure, but view Do-dong Seowon as an existent space before their eyes. Although the title board for Do-dong Seonwon was bestowed in the first half of the 17th century, Jeyeongsi(\u984c\u8a60\u8a69) about it primarily consist of works created by literary men who lived in the 18th-19th century, which may be associated with the situation in which the contemporary intellectuals suffered from serious chaos caused by foreign countries\u2019 reckless invasion. Do-dong Seowon was memorized by intellectuals who faced the modern transition period, not only as the space for reverence for Kim Goeingpil and for junior scholars\u2019 lectures. The intellectuals, who might be more concerned about the role of Confucianism than ever, thus attempted to memorize Do-dong Seowon as the space for wishing the recovery of the national destiny, the revival of Confucianism and the succession of Confucian philosophy.<|endoftext|>Can't find a pic. The first, guitar bridge construction type is the fixed bridge, whilst the second type is floating bridge type (also known to be the tremolo bridges). When purchasing the floating bridge guitar, the most important factor that you have to consider is the budget. Also, since the construction needs to be a little more detailed, you might want to look into defects especially around the bridge area. Sign up Log in. A real floating bridge. ultimate guitar com. Gonna try to find a pic of that thing. So, before I even consider doing any intonation work, I fully set up the guitar. Some guitar players prefer a floating bridge, as it allows them to manipulate the whammy bar in both directions instead of only forward. In this case, I leveled all the frets, setup, and intonated this Epiphone Joe Pass hollowbody before I started securing the floating bridge. Gregg Allman - Floating Bridge Low Country Blues (2011) Original in B, so when played in A: Capo 2 --- / [Intro] A A A A / [Verse 1] A A A A Well, I never will forget that floatin' bridge D. A major cause of the floating tremolo's increasingly poor reputation since its introduction is the far-increased availability and popularity of lighter guitar strings, which do not produce enough tension in standard tuning to compensate for the low break-angle over the bridge and, in the Jaguar's case, the exceptionally short scale length of 24 inches. However, their construction fits into two anatomies. It\u2019s important to note that if your guitar isn\u2019t properly set up, trying to set the intonation is pointless. The Two Guitar Bridge Types (Fixed Bridge & Floating Bridge) There are many different types of guitar bridges out there. A floating bridge is a term that refers to a guitar bridge that is raised up and not flush against the body of the guitar."

I know that |usl because the plan produces positive results in the past, this does not guarantee success in the future.

Although the original course is dated June 1933. the actual alterations were handwritten in early 1955. So I can presume that Gann thought it was important enough to insert and sign it before he sent the course to Mr. Rondinone And what did Gann write?

Many call them \u201cThe Sound of the Apocalypse\u201d. Information about that comes from all over the world: US, UK, Costa Rica, Russia, Czech Republic, Australia, etc.\nWe have analyzed records of these sounds and found that most of their spectrum lies within the infrasound range, i.e. is not audible to humans. What people hear is only a small fraction of the actual power of these sounds.\nThey are low-frequency acoustic emissions in the range between 20 and 100 Hz modulated by ultra-low infrasonic waves from 0.1 to 15 Hz. In geophysics, they are called acoustic-gravity waves; they are formed in the upper atmosphere, at the atmosphere-ionosphere boundary in particular.\nThere can be quite a lot of causes why those waves are generated: earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, storms, tsunamis, etc. However, the scale of the observed humming sound in terms of both the area covered and its power far exceeds those that can be generated by the above-mentioned phenomena.\nIn our opinion, the source of such powerful and immense manifestation of acoustic-gravity waves must be very large-scale energy processes. These processes include powerful solar flares and huge energy flows generated by them, rushing towards Earth\u2019s surface and destabilizing the magnetosphere, ionosphere and upper atmosphere. Thus, the effects of powerful solar flares: the impact of shock waves in the solar wind, streams of corpuscles and bursts of electromagnetic radiation are the main causes of generation of acoustic-gravitation waves following increased solar activity.\nGiven the surge in solar activity as manifested itself in the higher number and energy of solar flares since mid-2011, we can assume that there is a high probability of impact of the substantial increase in solar activity on the generation of the unusual humming coming from the sky. It should be pointed out that influential scientific institutions in 2010 and 2011.\nMeanwhile, the observed increase in solar activity is fully consistent with the forecast of the International Committee GEOCHANGE published in the Committee\u2019s Report in June 2010. If this growth rate of solar activity continues, its amplitude by the end of 2012 will be higher than the amplitude of 23rd solar cycle, and in 2013-2014 the solar activity will reach its peak the amplitude of which was predicted by us to be 1.5 \u2013 1.7 times higher than the amplitude of the 23rd cycle.\nBut you said that the cause of the \u201csky hum\u201d can lie within Earth\u2019s core as well, what does it mean?\nThere is one more possible cause of these sounds and it may lie at the Earth\u2019s core. The fact is that the acceleration of the drift of the Earth\u2019s north magnetic pole which increased more than fivefold between 1998 and 2003 and is at the same level today points to intensification of energy processes in the Earth\u2019s core, since it is processes in the inner and outer core that form the Earth\u2019s geomagnetic field.\nMeanwhile, as we have already reported, on November 15, 2011 all ATROPATENA geophysical stations which record three-dimensional variations of the Earth\u2019s gravitational field almost simultaneously registered a powerful gravitational impulse. The stations are deployed in Istanbul, Kiev, Baku, Islamabad and Yogyakarta, with the first and last one being separated by a distance of about 10,000 km.\nSuch a phenomenon is only possible if the source of this emanation is at the Earth\u2019s core level. That huge energy release from the Earth\u2019s core at the end of the last year was some kind of a start signal indicating the transition of the Earth\u2019s internal energy into a new active phase.\nIntensification of the energy processes in the Earth\u2019s core can modulate the geomagnetic field which, through a chain of physical processes at the ionosphere \u2013 atmosphere boundary level, generates acoustic-gravity waves the audible range of which has been heard by people in the form of a frightening low-frequency sound in different parts of our planet.\nIn both cases, even though the causes of acoustic-gravity waves are of a quite understandable geophysical nature, they are indicative of the expected significant increase in solar activity and the geodynamic activity of our planet.\nThere is no doubt that processes in the core rule the internal energy of our planet, therefore, we should expect by the end of 2012 a sharp rise in strong earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis and extreme weather events with peak levels in 2013 \u2013 2014.<|endoftext|>What does it meaning overhead in the dream?\nIf you dreamed of using an overhead projector to give a presentation, you will experience a pleasant change in your life - possibly an improved status in your social position.<|endoftext|>20 Fudgey AIO Newborn Pocket Cloth Nappies shells to start your newborn cloth nappy journey.\nOur Fudgey 3'n'1 ORIGINALS have three layers of sewn in absobency allowing for use as an AIO.

Studies), better known as Sunday Brunch, who made her debut with an album called 200km/h. Once a legendary singer of Sonagi, a main band dongahree in Yonsei Univ., she also performed in Akaraka in 2008. Although she decided to be a singer despite her major and university education, she is happy now to be doing what she wants. The Yonsei Annals interviewed her as a role model for Yonseians who are having trouble finding their own dream, under the pressure of society.\nWhat influenced you to become a singer?\nEver since I was young, I liked music much more than others of my age. This is probably because, as my father was an audio collector, I had lots of chances to listen to music. Plus, I was a member of a band at Geochang High School when I was a student, which was very liberal and unsystematic. Actually, until then, I had no talent but just passion and interest in music. However, I could sing as much as I wanted after classes thanks to the free atmosphere, so I did not study much but enjoyed singing. I think that was when I made up my mind to become a singer.\nWhy did you choose Yonsei and your major?\nWhen I talked with my parents about my future, my father persuaded me that he would not stop me from becoming a singer if I went to a university of high academic reputation. So since senior year of high school, I started studying hard in order to achieve my dream. Regarding my major, I wanted something that had nothing to do with mathematics, as I was not that good at it. Also, I wanted to think in various perspectives open-mindedly, and thought that I would be able to learn this through political science. Yet, I did not have interest in academic learning, since I sincerely felt that it was not my thing.\nWhat were your special experiences as a lead singer, or a student?\nDuring my college days, life itself was special. I had put all my passion into and led an active life in Sonagi since I was a freshman. At first, I was stressed from the fact that I had to perform in front of people, feeling oppressed by all the people in the audience. Yet, as the days passed, I gained more confidence, and was finally able to win the top prize in MBC University Song Festival. I had even received proposals from agencies. Due to such accumulated experiences, I did not feel that exceptional even after releasing my first album since it seemed like a continuation of my dongahree life.\nApart from Songai, there was nothing special about college since I did not really know the students in my department. Once, however, I had a chance to participate in Political Science Camp without knowing any of the other students there. Luckily, I really had a great time with many people and professors. I thought professors would not like me because due to heavy band practice, I did not study hard. Surprisingly, contrary to my anxieties, they really enjoyed my singing, and I became close with them. I keep in touch with some of the professors even until now.\nWhen I was a high school student, I was not yet sure to promise that I would become a singer. After entering university, however, I had many opportunities to become a singer, such as offers from agencies. I also got envious looks from those around me, and all of these made me lighthearted. Yet, all this excitement brought a confusion, and due to personal reasons, I gave up my dream at that time.\nAlthough I abandoned my attempt to become a singer, I had a lingering affection for it. I had the belief that when choosing my job, I should be fond of and be good at it, and that it should be acknowledged by people. Only after this period did I realize that my dream met all these requirements. I started to reconsider my future deeply, and decided to challenge myself to become a singer again. However, it was just a start. After contracting with the agency and setting my foot in the entertainment field, I noticed that the atmosphere was quite different from what I was familiar with. Oftentimes, people and the things around seemed absurd and irrational as a result, and naturally, I felt excluded from these people and suffered hardships. This is when I learned how different the reality is from the ideal.\nAptitude versus academic background, what would you recommend?\nI cannot simply say which is better since I myself was also in agony choosing my path before. I think it is up to each individual to decide what is more important to him or her, following one\u2019s dreams or doing what society wants. Everyone is different, and I cannot devalue external factors such as the demands of family or social recognition. Perhaps students who attend prestigious universities, the so-called SKY, are more burdened with external factors when determining their future. If I had not gotten any prizes in contests and if people had not acknowledged my ability, I am not sure if I would have continued to try to become a singer. As the choice lies with each individual\u2019s priorities, I cannot say which is right. At least for me, my own desire was more important than other elements, which is why I ultimately chose this path.\nWhile I studied politics in detail, I felt that it was just theory for the sake of theory. It seemed that I could not change the world with these vain theories. However, music is different. Music can affect people in various ways, such as changing their thoughts by conveying diverse messages through disparate genres, melodies or lyrics. Music is what fascinates my life.\nWhile preparing my first album, I did not take much part in the recording production progress; all I did was to coat the songs with my voice. All the melodies and lyrics were provided by the agency, and were not of my own creation, so I even felt that they were not my songs. Currently, I am preparing my next album, and trying to write down the lyrics on my own, expressing what I want to say. Also, since the genre of my previous album was modern rock which is unfamiliar to most people, I will add popular pop sound to appeal more to the public.\nFirst of all, I would appreciate it very much if you would give me lots of love. (laughs) I often wander around Yonsei Univ. and see many students tired out from having to study so tremendously much. I feel sorry for them, trapped in their choking routines. However, I do not want to tell them to do what they simply like when deciding on their future, since it each individual must make their own decision. I advise Yonseians to ask themselves seriously what is more important for them. I hope they listen to their heart thoroughly, and make a decision that they will not regret.<|endoftext|>luxurious design and state-of-the-art technology.\nThe advanced technology that you would come to expect from a Hyundai has further been improved in the Elantra, which comes optional with a SatNav and touchscreen infotainment system complete with Bluetooth connectivity and USB ports.\nThe Elantra\u2019s spacious interior, leather seats and cruise control will not only impress, but also ensure the most leisurely and luxurious ride for you and your passengers.

A recent phylogenetic study based on extensive sampling revealed that S. renifolius in Korea, now described as S. koreanus, is more closely related to S. nipponicus in Korea and Japan than it is to S. renifolius in Japan and the Russian Far East (Lee et al., 2019).\nMorphologically, S. koreanus is most similar to S. renifolius in Japan, including in life history traits, perhaps sharing their most recent common ancestor. However, S. koreanus has a much smaller and more spherical spadix with fewer, smaller flowers than S. renifolius (Tables 1, 2). The average spadix length of S. koreanus is 12 mm, while that of S. renifolius is 22 mm. In addition, the average spadix width of S. koreanus is 10 mm, whereas that of S. renifolius is 15 mm. The ratio between spadix length (L) and width (W) is also different: 1.2 and 1.4 for S. koreanus and S. renifolius, respectively. Lastly, S. koreanus has many fewer flowers per spadix than S. renifolius: average of 40 versus 79. Thus, the spadix of S. koreanus in its size, shape and flower number is more similar to the spadix of S. nipponicus than to S. renifolius.\nComparison of major features of Symplocarpus koreanus and related species in eastern Asia.\nWe utilized flow cytometry to estimate ploidy level between S. koreanus and S. renifolius (see comprehensive review and references in Kron et al., 2007). Briefly, young, fresh leaf samples were analyzed on BD FACSAria Fusion Sorter System (BD Biosciences Ltd., Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) in the Cooperative Center for Research Facilities in the School of Medicine at Sungkyunkwan University. We followed the general procedures described in Dole\u017eel et al. (2007); each analysis was repeated three times. It was previously determined that three previously sampled populations of S. koreanus (Geumbyeong, Samak, and Ungil mountains) were diploid (Lee et al., 2019). Flow cytometry in this study confirmed that the genome of S. koreanus was diploid when compared to the tetraploid genome of S. renifolius in Japan (Fig. 2). Two additional populations of S. koreanus (Gangwon-do, Yonghwasan Mt. and Gyeonggi-do, Chungryungsan Mt.) had 2C (pg.) average values of 4.63 and 3.99, respectively. In contrast, the 2C value of S. renifolius had an average value of 7.08 for a population in Ibaragi Prefecture and 6.96 for a population in Iwate Prefecture. The flow cytometry results showed twice the 2C value in S. koreanus, suggesting a different ploidy level, as previously determined using karyotyping (Iwatsubo and Otsuka, 2005; Lee et al., 2019).\n1.
