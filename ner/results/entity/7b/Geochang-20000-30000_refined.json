To see a complete list of all EPIK Program requirements, continue reading...\nIf you\u2019re considering your options for teaching English abroad in South Korea, you\u2019ve likely heard about the EPIK Program. EPIK stands for \u201cEnglish Program in Korea\u201d and is sponsored by the Korean Ministry of Education. The goal of the EPIK program is to improve the English-speaking abilities of Korean students and teachers, developing cultural exchanges between Korea and abroad. With these goals in mind, the EPIK Program seeks qualified, enthusiastic native English speakers to share their knowledge and passion in the Korean public school system and country.\nWith competitive salaries and great benefits like health-care, paid vacation, flight reimbursement, and provided housing, the EPIK program offers some of the best teaching positions in the country. That said, the program seems to grow more popular & more competitive with each passing year. Having a back-up plan is recommended and South Korea offers many opportunities to teach at private language centers and \"Hagwons\".\nThe application process can be a bit extensive, so make sure to check out what is required for the EPIK application, Also, EPIK teachers begin their teaching assignments in Korea in either September or March. Applications must be submitted between Feb-July for the September start date and between Aug-Jan for the March start date.\nWant to learn more about teaching English in South Korea and around the world?\nAbout the author Cassie Wells - A Midwestern girl from Valparaiso, Indiana, Cassie had never been abroad until she quit her job as a television producer on her 24 birthday to teach English in South Korea.

Is this home?\nIs it Grand Rapids, the Midwestern plains where I rode sure-footed ponies through my adolescence?\nIs it Korea? Pusan, where I was born? Seoul where I spent five months in foster care, and the city where I spend the most time when I visit? Geochang, where Halmoni lives, and where Omma was born and raised? Or Ulsan, where she and my sisters live now, a city I have yet to visit?\nAs my understanding of family changes and grows, I\u2019m finding that so does my definition of home.

The issuances are detailed in note 21 to the audited financial statements.\nThe Group has a policy of equal opportunities throughout the organisation and is proud of its culture of diversity and tolerance.

However, the pandemic may affect adversely the Group's ability to implement its planned development programmes for the coming year - whether due to logistical challenges, such as the curtailment of international flights; the unavailability of mining personnel, equipment or materials or governmental restrictions which may be imposed in any of the jurisdictions in which the Group it operates. The Company will continue to actively monitor the response to the pandemic and will manage the consequences as they arise.\nThe Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The Directors have prepared the financial statements for each financial period which present fairly the state of affairs of the Group and the profit or loss of the Group for that period.\nby the European Union in preparing the Group's financial statements.\nInternational Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial period the company's financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful presentation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board's \"Framework for the preparation and presentation of financial statements\". In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable International Financial Reporting Standards.\nLondon Stock Exchange for companies trading securities on the Stock Exchange.\nreasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities and for the preparation of financial statements.\nwebsite is the responsibility of the Directors; the work carried out by the auditors do not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may occur to the financial statements after they are presented initially on the web-site.\nLegislation in the British Virgin Islands governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\u00b7 The group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit and loss of the Group.\n\u00b7 The annual report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the financial position of the group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\nThis Directors' Report was approved by the Board of Directors on 29 June 2020 and is signed on its behalf.\nThe Group is a project developer and targets mining projects that may be brought into production within 24 to 30 months within Asia. Many opportunities are presented in the form of old underground gold mines which can be re-opened, a process with which the Company's Management team has substantial experience.\n\u00b7 the overall cost to reopen is far cheaper per ounce than new ounces at the same grade.\nSouth Korea is a modern, industrialised economy, a representative democracy and has substantial infrastructure advantages, in many respects, superior to western jurisdictions. South Korea is an investment grade country with Moodys and Standard & Poors ratings of AA and Aa2 respectively.\nThe past year has seen the farm-in arrangement with Southern Gold completed and South Korean joint ventures established for each of the two projects. BMV operates both the Gubong Project Company and the Geochang[1] Project Company.\nTo the end of December 2019, the Company had incurred USD 1,405,778 of farm-in expenditure. These costs were expensed through the Company's consolidated income statement, in line with accounting policies, and were a requirement for the formation of the Gubong and Kochang joint ventures with Southern Gold Ltd.\nThe project is just over one hour's drive west of Daejeon, the second largest city in South Korea. Access to the site is by sealed roads to within 100 metres of the old mine. Other infrastructure such as power and telecommunications are also placed conveniently.\nGubong was South Korea's second largest gold producer historically and the largest during 1930-1943, during the Japanese occupation. It still retains substantial remnant ore between mined blocks and excellent exploration potential. Mine data indicates good potential for mine re-commissioning and the possibility of relatively early cash flow.\nThere is a dearth of information considering the age of the mine and there is anecdotal evidence that the information relating to gold production is understated as there was little government control over the Japanese mining companies.\nThere are no declared JORC resource estimates currently at Gubong.\nThe immediate Gubong project area hosts five historical underground mines with the largest being the Gubong mine which exploited high grade quartz veins hosted in gneissic granite and mined to a vertical depth of approximately 500 metres.\nHistoric underground sampling results of the deeper levels of Vein 6, the main vein exploited at Gubong, gives an arithmetic uncut average of 30.6 g/t gold from 146 values. Exploratory core drilling below the now abandoned mine workings from one of five holes returned 27.9 g/t gold and 25 g/t silver over 1.6 metres downhole from 845.2 metres. This demonstration of the persistence with depth of the most developed mineralised structure supports the prospectivity of the property for auriferous shoots with considerable depth continuity.\nInterestingly, Vein 6 was found as a blind vein in the hanging wall during mine development work on the other veins. This suggests substantial gold resources may be found in parallel vein systems that do not outcrop in the area.\nThere has been no physical work undertaken at Gubong in the period to 31 December 2019. An application for a \"Permit to Develop\" the mine was submitted in late December 2018. The process was supposed to have taken 2 months however, the Provincial Government took a lot longer to review the submission and in May decided to defer the decision to a higher authority. The committee appointed to review the submission sat for a final decision on 30 August 2019 and issued their approval of the \"Permit to Develop\" on 10 September 2019.\nThe Kochang Mine began in 1928 but production records started in 1938 with the Nippon Mining Co which mined until 1942. Production restarted in 1961 and was fairly constant until 1975.\nThe workings extend over 1.2-1.5 km (2.5 km including the silver shaft area) from south west to north east and extend down dip to about 120 m below surface. The workings exploit 5-7 veins striking 050o with a dip of 50-70NW. There seem to have been 4 shafts (North shaft, south shaft, main shaft and silver shaft). The gold and silver mines have been worked as separate mines in the past but recent work suggests that they are part of the same deposit and that resources may extend between them.\nFollowing the last year of recorded production in 1975, exploratory level development was carried out in 1981 and 1990, presumably by KORES. Korean underground plans dated 1990 show the results of the sampling of quartz veins along portions of the gold mine at Kochang. In aggregate, a total of 104 underground samples are depicted with gold results ranging from 0.4 g/t up to 102.6 g/t for sample widths ranging from 0.03 metres to 0.6 metres in thickness. The length weighted average value of all the underground samples is 17.05 g/t gold over 0.2 metres.\nOf further interest is a particularly well mineralised 120 metre length of Vein 3 at the southern end of the prospecting drive on 245RL which gave a length weighted average value of 57.27 g/t gold over a 0.29 metre width: indicating the presence of higher grade ore shoots at Kochang. Bonanza grades were reportedly mined from upper levels of the north shaft vein.\nIn 1984, four inclined core holes were drilled at Kochang, but their coordinates are generally unknown. Each hole intersected narrow quartz veins. Two of the holes were sampled for assay over intersections of interest. One drill hole 84-2 was collared in a new deposit called the Sanpo Mine at 238 RL, azimuth of 225 and dip 70. Of the nine results reported, Hole 84-2 gave two intersections above 1 g/t gold in one hole. The intersections were 10.6 g/t gold and 12 g/t silver over 0.6 metres from 26.9 metres and 17.6 g/t gold and 4 g/t silver over 2.5 metres from 63.0 metres respectively. At 97.6 metres a 2.4m vein gave trace gold and 1,763 g/t silver.\nThis drill hole opens up a \"new\" parallel mineralised structure of up to 2.5m wide to be explored and the possibility of other as yet unknown structures related to the same hydrothermal fluid source and regional structures.\nThe Company continued to examine and explore the underground workings and surrounding area, locating previously unknown adits to the east of the mine.

This study found that the level of crop water stress could be easily calculated using CWSIEE with only air and canopy temperature data.\nIn this study, we estimated soil moisture values using the Deep Neural Network(DNN) scheme at the mountainous regions. In order to test the sensitive analysis of DNN scheme, we collected the measured(at the soil depths of 10 cm and 30 cm) soil moisture and DNN input(weather and land surface) data at the Pyeongchang-gun(relatively flat) and Geochang-gun(steep slope) sites. Our findings indicated that the soil moisture estimates were sensitive to the weather variables(5 days-averaged rainfall, 5 days precedent rainfall, accumlated rainfall) and DEM. These findings showed that the DEM and weather variables play the key role in the processes of soil water flow at the mountainous regions. We estimated the soil moisture values at the soil depths of 10 cm and 30 cm using DNN at two study sites under different climate-landsurface conditions. The estimated soil moisture(R: 0.890 and RMSE: 0.041) values at the soil depth of 10 cm were comparable with the measured data in Pyeongchang-gun site while the soil moisture estimates(R: 0.843 and RMSE: 0.048) at the soil depth of 30 cm were relatively biased. The DNN-based soil moisture values(R: 0.997/0.995 and RMSE: 0.014/0.006) at the soil depth of 10 cm/30 cm matched well with the measured data in Geochang-gun site. Although uncertainties exist in the results, our findings indicated that the DNN-based soil moisture estimation scheme demonstrated the good performance in estimating soil moisture values using weather and land surface information at the monitoring sites. Our proposed scheme can be useful for efficient land surface management in various areas such as agriculture, forest hydrology, etc.\nAlthough there have been a lot of efforts to improve water quality in the estuarine reservoir, overall the water quality problems of the estuarine reservoirs remain. So, it is essential to establish water quality management plans under a comprehensive understanding of the environmental characteristics of the estuarine reservoir. Therefore, in this study, a resilience analysis framework for evaluating the estuarine reservoir\u2019s water quality was suggested for improving existing assessment method for water quality management plan. First, as a result of analyzing the static resilience to each scenario, it was found that from the S3 scenario in which dredging was conducted considerably, the resilience of about 30% more than the current estuarine reservoir system was restored. Second, as a result of analyzing the dynamic resilience, if cost and time are considered, there is no significant difference in robustness and resourcefulness, so it can be seen that the resilience of the estuarine reservoir can be efficiently improved by simply performing dredging up to the level of Scenario 3. Finally, as a result of comparing static and dynamic resilience, since static resilience is only presented as a single value, the differences and characteristics of the resilience capacity of the estuarine reservoir might be overlooked only by the static resilience analysis. However, in the aspect that it is possible to interpret the internal recovery capacity of the estuarine reservoir in multiple ways with various indicators (robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness, rapidity), evaluating water quality based on dynamic resilience analysis is useful.<|endoftext|>"

The fan began to explain who the group was while her mother took out her phone and took detailed notes.\nAfter note-taking, her mother asked for some videos of the group. As soon as legendary clips of BTS came on the screen, her mother whipped out her phone and started comparing the notes to the video, trying to memorize who is who.\nThe fan took her mother\u2019s phone to take a look and this is what she found: A whole list of the member\u2019s names, ages, and traits.\nRM (Kim Nam Joon) 25 years old.

Bidding began at 1.5 billion won (US$1.23 million) each but ended with zero bids.\nGilt-bronze Standing Buddha, dating back to the middle of the 7th century during the period of Unified Silla (668-918), was designated as South Korea's Treasure No. 284 in 1963. Standing in an imposing posture, its height reaches 38 centimeters, larger than any other gilt-bronze Buddhist statue manufactured during the Silla period.\nGilt-bronze Standing Bodhisattva, which was made between the 6th and 7th centuries during the Silla period, was designated as Treasure No. 285 in 1963. The 19-cm-high statue was discovered in Geochang, southeast South Korea.\nKansong Art Museum was founded by Korean businessman Jeon Hyeong-pil (1906-1962) in 1938, initially with the name Bohwagak, during the Japanese occupation of the Korean Peninsula.\nWednesday was the first time that the Seoul-based private museum had put up part of its collection for auction. The auction plan reportedly came due to the museum's financial hardship.\nAmid concerns of overseas purchases, some cultural heritage experts have called for the National Museum of Korea (NMK) to use state coffers to buy and preserve the two treasures at home.\nNMK representatives reportedly reached out to Kansong for a private sale, but the latter insisted on holding a public auction to respect potential bidders.\nObservers predict that the Kansong museum will put the items, along with other treasures in its possession, back on auction in the near future.<|endoftext|>"

I thought the environment and students of CWNU are outstanding when I looked at it as the president of Geochang Provincial College. I ran for the election to develop CWNU more, using those conditions. So, it turned out to be a good result.\nQ. I anticipate a future of university administrations because you have lots of administrative experiences. Could you introduce to us how you will lead the school?\nChoi: I would like to lead student-centered university administrations. Making students people who are helpful to a community is important. We can overcome the present university\u2019s problems if we do this because the university is related with communities in every way. Anyway, I\u2019d like to make our school to the central university in Gyeongnam.\nQ. How would you get close to students?\nChoi: I would like to have a talk with regular students periodically more than executives. Our students are second to none but their family background is not good. For those students, I cared for a scholarship for their regular academic performances. The scholarship will be increased a little.\nQ. In these days, unemployment is a big issue not only for graduates but for other age groups. How can we get through these situations?\nChoi: I want to make people aware that CWNU has a higher employment rate by enhancing employment rate to 70% within a year. There are many enterprises around our university and I think it can solve unemployment. Among 3000 enterprises, we will sign MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) with 300 companies and one company can hire at least one person.\nQ. Many students\u2019 wish is an improvement of school cafeteria\u2019s menu quality. How would you figure out this problem?\nChoi: Students have told that lunch money is not expensive compared to other universities, but our school food quality is lower than others. I plan to resolve it within the school budget, not raising the cost. I\u2019m going to use the school cafeteria, too.\nQ. What do you think CWNU would be like after a four-year term?\nChoi: I want to see its standing as a national university from a local university. I\u2019ll try to foster the school for 4 years. Also, I like to see a growing school and will support it after my retirement.\nQ. Please leave a message to the students.\nChoi: Have a challenging spirit. Your dreams and hopes are endless. I believe it comes true as much as you set it and achieve it. However, you should increase your competitiveness and abilities at the same time because everything is made by efforts. If you can achieve it, I\u2019m sure our students will go to the world.<|endoftext|>"

There remains no Kim Goengpil\u2019s anthologies, so only Gyeonghyeonrok(\u666f\u8ce2\u9304) may seem to be selected as a reference for him, but there are, however, few writings of him, and therefore, it is difficult to investigate his scholarly career and guarantee the objectivity of the contents collected in them, as there are a lot of literature regarding the post-evaluation for Chujeung(\u8ffd\u8d08) and Gajeung(\u52a0\u8d08). Hence, the Chinese poems collected in others\u2019 anthologies were examined to show that the birth and death dates of authors from the contemporary figures who directly interacted with Kim Goengpil to Myeon-u Gwak Jongseok who lived in the 20th century are evenly distributed, and that the subjects of Chinese poems recited primarily include the text of \u2018Sohak(\u5c0f\u5b78)\u2019 on which he concentrated his efforts for a life; Hapcheon and Geochang, in which he often stayed when he was young; Huicheon and Suncheon, in which he stayed twice due to Sahwa(\u53f2\u798d); and Hyeonpung in which Do-dong Seowon is placed. Main places recited in the Chinese poems include Sohakdang(\u5c0f\u5b78\u5802) and Jidongam(\u5fd7\u540c\u5dd6), the spaces used for the lectures conducted together with Jeong Yeochang in Hapcheon; Supodae(\u6c34\u7011\u81fa) in which he strolled about together with his sister\u2019s husbands, Choi Sukryang and Jeong Yeochang and Mohyeongjeong(\u6155\u8ce2\u4ead) which Choi Sukryang\u2019s decendents constructed to celebrate the meeting of them in Geochang; and the site in which an old house is located and Do-dong Seowon in Hyeonpung. In the process, the contemporary poetry and prose about Kim Goengpil were created by concentrating on grief and reverence for him who suffered from political vicissitudes, but shifted the authors\u2019 focus to the space of Do-dong Seowon, generation after generation, probably implying that the descendents regard Kim Goengpil as a past figure, but view Do-dong Seowon as an existent space before their eyes. Although the title board for Do-dong Seonwon was bestowed in the first half of the 17th century, Jeyeongsi(\u984c\u8a60\u8a69) about it primarily consist of works created by literary men who lived in the 18th-19th century, which may be associated with the situation in which the contemporary intellectuals suffered from serious chaos caused by foreign countries\u2019 reckless invasion. Do-dong Seowon was memorized by intellectuals who faced the modern transition period, not only as the space for reverence for Kim Goeingpil and for junior scholars\u2019 lectures. The intellectuals, who might be more concerned about the role of Confucianism than ever, thus attempted to memorize Do-dong Seowon as the space for wishing the recovery of the national destiny, the revival of Confucianism and the succession of Confucian philosophy.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Mr. Khalilov, what is the nature of the unusual very low-pitched sounds reported by a great number of people in different parts of the planet since the summer of 2011? Many call them \u201cThe Sound of the Apocalypse\u201d. Information about that comes from all over the world: US, UK, Costa Rica, Russia, Czech Republic, Australia, etc.\nWe have analyzed records of these sounds and found that most of their spectrum lies within the infrasound range, i.e. is not audible to humans. What people hear is only a small fraction of the actual power of these sounds.\nThey are low-frequency acoustic emissions in the range between 20 and 100 Hz modulated by ultra-low infrasonic waves from 0.1 to 15 Hz. In geophysics, they are called acoustic-gravity waves; they are formed in the upper atmosphere, at the atmosphere-ionosphere boundary in particular.\nThere can be quite a lot of causes why those waves are generated: earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, storms, tsunamis, etc. However, the scale of the observed humming sound in terms of both the area covered and its power far exceeds those that can be generated by the above-mentioned phenomena.\nIn our opinion, the source of such powerful and immense manifestation of acoustic-gravity waves must be very large-scale energy processes. These processes include powerful solar flares and huge energy flows generated by them, rushing towards Earth\u2019s surface and destabilizing the magnetosphere, ionosphere and upper atmosphere. Thus, the effects of powerful solar flares: the impact of shock waves in the solar wind, streams of corpuscles and bursts of electromagnetic radiation are the main causes of generation of acoustic-gravitation waves following increased solar activity.\nGiven the surge in solar activity as manifested itself in the higher number and energy of solar flares since mid-2011, we can assume that there is a high probability of impact of the substantial increase in solar activity on the generation of the unusual humming coming from the sky. It should be pointed out that influential scientific institutions in 2010 and 2011.\nMeanwhile, the observed increase in solar activity is fully consistent with the forecast of the International Committee GEOCHANGE published in the Committee\u2019s Report in June 2010. If this growth rate of solar activity continues, its amplitude by the end of 2012 will be higher than the amplitude of 23rd solar cycle, and in 2013-2014 the solar activity will reach its peak the amplitude of which was predicted by us to be 1.5 \u2013 1.7 times higher than the amplitude of the 23rd cycle.\nBut you said that the cause of the \u201csky hum\u201d can lie within Earth\u2019s core as well, what does it mean?\nThere is one more possible cause of these sounds and it may lie at the Earth\u2019s core. The fact is that the acceleration of the drift of the Earth\u2019s north magnetic pole which increased more than fivefold between 1998 and 2003 and is at the same level today points to intensification of energy processes in the Earth\u2019s core, since it is processes in the inner and outer core that form the Earth\u2019s geomagnetic field.\nMeanwhile, as we have already reported, on November 15, 2011 all ATROPATENA geophysical stations which record three-dimensional variations of the Earth\u2019s gravitational field almost simultaneously registered a powerful gravitational impulse. The stations are deployed in Istanbul, Kiev, Baku, Islamabad and Yogyakarta, with the first and last one being separated by a distance of about 10,000 km.\nSuch a phenomenon is only possible if the source of this emanation is at the Earth\u2019s core level. That huge energy release from the Earth\u2019s core at the end of the last year was some kind of a start signal indicating the transition of the Earth\u2019s internal energy into a new active phase.\nIntensification of the energy processes in the Earth\u2019s core can modulate the geomagnetic field which, through a chain of physical processes at the ionosphere \u2013 atmosphere boundary level, generates acoustic-gravity waves the audible range of which has been heard by people in the form of a frightening low-frequency sound in different parts of our planet.\nIn both cases, even though the causes of acoustic-gravity waves are of a quite understandable geophysical nature, they are indicative of the expected significant increase in solar activity and the geodynamic activity of our planet.\nThere is no doubt that processes in the core rule the internal energy of our planet, therefore, we should expect by the end of 2012 a sharp rise in strong earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis and extreme weather events with peak levels in 2013 \u2013 2014.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "SONAGI LEAD vocal, top prize at MBC University Song Festival and a splendid debut on screen: this might sound like a daydream for ordinary students busy taking courses, but not for Kim Hee-young (\u201900, Dept. of Political Science & Int. Studies), better known as Sunday Brunch, who made her debut with an album called 200km/h. Once a legendary singer of Sonagi, a main band dongahree in Yonsei Univ., she also performed in Akaraka in 2008. Although she decided to be a singer despite her major and university education, she is happy now to be doing what she wants. The Yonsei Annals interviewed her as a role model for Yonseians who are having trouble finding their own dream, under the pressure of society.\nWhat influenced you to become a singer?\nEver since I was young, I liked music much more than others of my age. This is probably because, as my father was an audio collector, I had lots of chances to listen to music. Plus, I was a member of a band at Geochang High School when I was a student, which was very liberal and unsystematic. Actually, until then, I had no talent but just passion and interest in music. However, I could sing as much as I wanted after classes thanks to the free atmosphere, so I did not study much but enjoyed singing. I think that was when I made up my mind to become a singer.\nWhy did you choose Yonsei and your major?\nWhen I talked with my parents about my future, my father persuaded me that he would not stop me from becoming a singer if I went to a university of high academic reputation. So since senior year of high school, I started studying hard in order to achieve my dream. Regarding my major, I wanted something that had nothing to do with mathematics, as I was not that good at it. Also, I wanted to think in various perspectives open-mindedly, and thought that I would be able to learn this through political science. Yet, I did not have interest in academic learning, since I sincerely felt that it was not my thing.\nWhat were your special experiences as a lead singer, or a student?\nDuring my college days, life itself was special. I had put all my passion into and led an active life in Sonagi since I was a freshman. At first, I was stressed from the fact that I had to perform in front of people, feeling oppressed by all the people in the audience. Yet, as the days passed, I gained more confidence, and was finally able to win the top prize in MBC University Song Festival. I had even received proposals from agencies. Due to such accumulated experiences, I did not feel that exceptional even after releasing my first album since it seemed like a continuation of my dongahree life.\nApart from Songai, there was nothing special about college since I did not really know the students in my department. Once, however, I had a chance to participate in Political Science Camp without knowing any of the other students there. Luckily, I really had a great time with many people and professors. I thought professors would not like me because due to heavy band practice, I did not study hard. Surprisingly, contrary to my anxieties, they really enjoyed my singing, and I became close with them. I keep in touch with some of the professors even until now.\nWhen I was a high school student, I was not yet sure to promise that I would become a singer. After entering university, however, I had many opportunities to become a singer, such as offers from agencies. I also got envious looks from those around me, and all of these made me lighthearted. Yet, all this excitement brought a confusion, and due to personal reasons, I gave up my dream at that time.\nAlthough I abandoned my attempt to become a singer, I had a lingering affection for it. I had the belief that when choosing my job, I should be fond of and be good at it, and that it should be acknowledged by people. Only after this period did I realize that my dream met all these requirements. I started to reconsider my future deeply, and decided to challenge myself to become a singer again. However, it was just a start. After contracting with the agency and setting my foot in the entertainment field, I noticed that the atmosphere was quite different from what I was familiar with. Oftentimes, people and the things around seemed absurd and irrational as a result, and naturally, I felt excluded from these people and suffered hardships. This is when I learned how different the reality is from the ideal.\nAptitude versus academic background, what would you recommend?\nI cannot simply say which is better since I myself was also in agony choosing my path before. I think it is up to each individual to decide what is more important to him or her, following one\u2019s dreams or doing what society wants. Everyone is different, and I cannot devalue external factors such as the demands of family or social recognition. Perhaps students who attend prestigious universities, the so-called SKY, are more burdened with external factors when determining their future. If I had not gotten any prizes in contests and if people had not acknowledged my ability, I am not sure if I would have continued to try to become a singer. As the choice lies with each individual\u2019s priorities, I cannot say which is right. At least for me, my own desire was more important than other elements, which is why I ultimately chose this path.\nWhile I studied politics in detail, I felt that it was just theory for the sake of theory. It seemed that I could not change the world with these vain theories. However, music is different. Music can affect people in various ways, such as changing their thoughts by conveying diverse messages through disparate genres, melodies or lyrics. Music is what fascinates my life.\nWhile preparing my first album, I did not take much part in the recording production progress; all I did was to coat the songs with my voice. All the melodies and lyrics were provided by the agency, and were not of my own creation, so I even felt that they were not my songs. Currently, I am preparing my next album, and trying to write down the lyrics on my own, expressing what I want to say. Also, since the genre of my previous album was modern rock which is unfamiliar to most people, I will add popular pop sound to appeal more to the public.\nFirst of all, I would appreciate it very much if you would give me lots of love. (laughs) I often wander around Yonsei Univ. and see many students tired out from having to study so tremendously much. I feel sorry for them, trapped in their choking routines. However, I do not want to tell them to do what they simply like when deciding on their future, since it each individual must make their own decision. I advise Yonseians to ask themselves seriously what is more important for them. I hope they listen to their heart thoroughly, and make a decision that they will not regret.<|endoftext|>"

A recent phylogenetic study based on extensive sampling revealed that S. renifolius in Korea, now described as S. koreanus, is more closely related to S. nipponicus in Korea and Japan than it is to S. renifolius in Japan and the Russian Far East (Lee et al., 2019).\nMorphologically, S. koreanus is most similar to S. renifolius in Japan, including in life history traits, perhaps sharing their most recent common ancestor. However, S. koreanus has a much smaller and more spherical spadix with fewer, smaller flowers than S. renifolius (Tables 1, 2). The average spadix length of S. koreanus is 12 mm, while that of S. renifolius is 22 mm. In addition, the average spadix width of S. koreanus is 10 mm, whereas that of S. renifolius is 15 mm. The ratio between spadix length (L) and width (W) is also different: 1.2 and 1.4 for S. koreanus and S. renifolius, respectively. Lastly, S. koreanus has many fewer flowers per spadix than S. renifolius: average of 40 versus 79. Thus, the spadix of S. koreanus in its size, shape and flower number is more similar to the spadix of S. nipponicus than to S. renifolius.\nComparison of major features of Symplocarpus koreanus and related species in eastern Asia.\nWe utilized flow cytometry to estimate ploidy level between S. koreanus and S. renifolius (see comprehensive review and references in Kron et al., 2007). Briefly, young, fresh leaf samples were analyzed on BD FACSAria Fusion Sorter System (BD Biosciences Ltd., Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) in the Cooperative Center for Research Facilities in the School of Medicine at Sungkyunkwan University. We followed the general procedures described in Dole\u017eel et al. (2007); each analysis was repeated three times. It was previously determined that three previously sampled populations of S. koreanus (Geumbyeong, Samak, and Ungil mountains) were diploid (Lee et al., 2019). Flow cytometry in this study confirmed that the genome of S. koreanus was diploid when compared to the tetraploid genome of S. renifolius in Japan (Fig. 2). Two additional populations of S. koreanus (Gangwon-do, Yonghwasan Mt. and Gyeonggi-do, Chungryungsan Mt.) had 2C (pg.) average values of 4.63 and 3.99, respectively. In contrast, the 2C value of S. renifolius had an average value of 7.08 for a population in Ibaragi Prefecture and 6.96 for a population in Iwate Prefecture. The flow cytometry results showed twice the 2C value in S. koreanus, suggesting a different ploidy level, as previously determined using karyotyping (Iwatsubo and Otsuka, 2005; Lee et al., 2019).\n1. Inflorescence emerging before leaves in early spring; apex of spathe oriented horizontally.\n1.

        "passage": "I was at the Gyeongnam v Seoul fixture last season and so normally wouldn\u2019t have bothered travelling south to somewhere that I\u2019d already visited. What caught my attention about this game though was that Gyeongnam weren\u2019t playing at their normal ground in Changwon, but were hosting the fixture thirty-odd miles away in Jinju.\nI find it hard to resist the chance to visit a new ground, particularly one that only gets used once a year and so I thought I might as well make the effort. Gyeongnam has previous for this sort of thing, they played a game at Geochang earlier in the season and have also staged matches at Masan, Milyang and Yangsan in the past. I have a feeling that they would probably play in your back garden if you offered them enough cash.\nIt reminds me a bit of the way that county cricket teams would share their fixtures around. Yorkshire would regularly visit Acklam Park whilst Durham would turn out now and then at Stockton Cricket Club. I\u2019m not sure to what extent it still goes on but I suspect it\u2019s less common these days than it was in the past.\nI got the bus from Seoul Express bus terminal at 8.20am. It was 22,000 won and they seem to run pretty frequently. The roads were clearer than normal and I arrived in Jinju on time at 12.10pm.\nI\u2019d actually been to Jinju before. I was there last year with my mate Paul either side of a hike up Jirisan. On that occasion though, we\u2019d seen the inside of a bar or two and the bus station, but not a great deal more. As I had plenty of time before the 3pm kick-off I wandered along to the fortress by the river which is okay for a quick visit.\nThere are a few old looking buildings inside the fortress walls that have been rebuilt over the years. There is also a rock that a local girl jumped off a few hundred years ago. She managed to drown a Japanese General by throwing herself into the river and dragging him in with her. There was none of that sort of thing going on whilst I was there, but with a visit from a K-League team once a year I suppose that the locals no longer feel the need to make their own entertainment.\nBe careful if you are a Japanese General.\nI\u2019d seen as much of the fortress as I wanted to by one o\u2019clock and thought that I might as well walk to the stadium. I\u2019d picked up a map earlier and it seemed easy enough, just follow the river until you get there. The river walk was quite pleasant. It was a bit overgrown but provided an opportunity to see some wildlife along the way, mainly butterflies and herons.\nJust keep the river to your right and you won't get lost.\nAs the time moved towards half past two I was getting a little worried that my map may not have been too accurate, but fortunately the stadium came into sight. It\u2019s a very impressive looking ground, built last year with a sensible capacity of twenty thousand.\nI got a ticket for eight thousand won and sat with a few lads that I know towards the back of one of side stands. The stadium was just as impressive inside as out, the highlight being a grassy bank behind one of the goals. It\u2019s a feature that I like and I\u2019ve enjoyed stretching out on the grass before at LA Galaxy and at Munhak for the baseball. I first encountered one at Wigan in the Boro\u2019s 1986-7 promotion season, but the climate in north-west England meant that it was more like a slag heap. It wasnt just the players who should have been wearing football boots that day.\nFC Seoul fans behind the goal.\nThere was an excellent turnout for the game, although as usual, people were still arriving well into the second half. At its peak, I\u2019d say the place was 95% full, although the announced attendance claimed an impressive 110% capacity at 22,000.\nAs far as the game went, it was always likely to end in tears for Gyeongnam. Seoul are having a far better season and needed a win themselves to clinch third place. Gyeongnam had a slim chance of making the play-offs but in addition to requiring three points they were also relying on two other teams failing to win.\nNot a great deal happened in the first hour. Seoul then broke the deadlock when a heavily deflected shot from Ha Dae Sung wrongfooted veteran keeper Kim Byeung Ji. Gyeongnam\u2019s task was made a little harder when they had a bloke sent off for something off the ball. I didn\u2019t see what happened but unfortunately for Jeong Da Hooeon the ref did.\nGyeongnam pushed forward despite being a man down and were then caught twice as Ha Dae Sung completed his hat-trick. In the end results elsewhere meant that the three-nil defeat didn\u2019t matter. A lot of the crowd had gome home early once Seoul got on top, but it was still busy on the way out. As I left I was passed by about a hundred Korean RAF lads marching in formation.\nThe traffic was heavier on the way back to Seoul<|endoftext|>"

Millions died, a significant portion of the entire population. There was the Ganghwa massacre, Geochang massacre, No Gun Ri Massacre, Seoul National University Hospital massacre, Sinchon Massacre, and Sancheong-Hamyang massacre. Tens of thousands of South Korean soldiers starved to death when their commanding officers embezzled funds earmarked for their food.\n\nEven after the war civilians continued to be massacred. The Bodo League massacre alone saw US educated South Korean President Syngman Rhee order the execution of over 100,000 suspected South Korean leftist sympathizers and their families. His political opponents were assassinated and protesters were shot. Eventually the people of South Korea marched on Blue House and the CIA evacuated Rhee to retire in Hawaii. This was not the end, when the people finally had a democratically elected leader a military coup took place and the US continued to provide support as the new order terrorised it's own citizens.\n\nI could go on but this is well documented history, instead here are some quotes from high-ranking members of the US forces involved in war:\n\n&gt; We burned down just about every city in North Korea and South Korea both [...] We killed off over a million civilian Koreans and drove several million more from their homes, with the inevitable additional tragedies bound to ensue.\n\n- Gen.

        "passage": "Fall was coming to an end at the base of Mount Jiri near the banks of the Seomjin River where a small hanok, or traditional Korean house, was being built.\nThe hanok is surrounded by the beauty of nature. The river flows in front and the mountain looms in the background. It is located in Baekuncheon Village, Gurae County, South Jeolla.\nOn a recent visit, the house was still in the middle of construction. Sawdust flew everywhere. Piles of stone and lumber were stacked around the courtyard. But there was something interesting and unusual about this hanok construction crew \u2015 amid the thunderous noise of electric saws, a strong South American beat permeated the worksite.\nTall people with blue eyes, reggae hairstyles and a long beards were busy running around the site toting planks. The mix of language included English, Spanish and Korean. Shouts of \u201cDavid! Cut longer\u201d and \u201cJohn! Trae lo aqui,\u201d which means \u201cbring it here,\u201d punctured the air. This hanok was being built by foreigners enjoying an adventure in the Korean countryside, David Eisele, Nicolas Rousseau, Jeffery Lozar and John Herresa.\nEisele, a 28-year-old German, said Mount Jiri is amazing and he hates cities. He still has yet to visit Seoul.\nFor a foreigner who has been in Korea less than 10 months, his command of the Korean language is fluent. Eisele, who grew up in southern Germany, studied carpentry for three years after graduating from high school. He traveled around the world with money he earned from carpentry in France, Spain and Mexico.\nWith his global experience, Eisele was fluent not only in his native German, but also in English, French and Spanish. Thanks to his multilingual ability, one of his many tasks was interpretation among the foreigners and Koreans at the worksite.\nWhile learning to become a carpenter in Germany, Eisele saw a video on Asian architecture and became curious about how the triangular roofs were built. During a trip to France he made friends with a 26-year-old Korean named Chan-yeon.\nEisele then visited Chan-yeon\u2019s hometown of Busan in February of this year and traveled by bicycle from Namhae, Geochang to Namwon along the southern coast of the Korean Peninsula.\nDavid Eisele puts modern tools to work on a traditional project.\nPerhaps it was destiny that during his trip he also met carpenter Kim Gil-su, who was building a hanok at the bottom of Mount Jiri. Kim decided to hire the German carpenter, who was skilled with his hands, on the spot.\nWhen asked about the attractive features of hanok, the German said he appreciates the connections between the pieces of wood without the use of nails. He said in ancient Europe, arc-shaped structures used similar methods.\nIn learning about hanok construction for six months, Eisele became something of an expert \u2015 from measuring the size of the building to smoothing lumber and fixing window frames. He earns 80,000 won ($86) a day. The German carpenter said that in Europe, carpenters earn twice what they make in Korea.\nBut this escapade, he says, is not really about money. Building the hanok is more about fun, friendship and a cultural experience. Eisele said his plan after the hanok is to travel the rest of Asia with the money he has earned.

They also are well connected to buses and subways, enabling you to reach your final destination with ease. The KTX (Korea Train Express) is fastest and the most expensive, followed by the Saemaeul and the Mugunghwa.\n(1) KTX KTX tickets can be reserved through ticket boxes at stations, travel agencies, automatic ticket issuance machines and the website (www.korail.com). Reservations and ticketing services are available from 09:00 a.m. and reservations can be made from two months to one hour before the time of departure. If the party making reservations is different from the party who will use the train, the party making reservations is responsible for the payment of the fare.\n(2) Saemaeul Train Saemaeul trains are better passenger trains and travel faster than Mugungwha trains, as the number of stops is fewer. For reservations, visit the ticket box of the stations, travel agencies, automatic ticket issuance machines or the website (www.korail.com).\n(3) Mugungwha Train Mugungwha trains are operated on every Korail route. Not every train stops at every station, and a selective stop system is used to reduce travel time while maximizing the number of stations served.\n6_Airlines Traveling by air saves time when traveling long distances, but is more expensive compared to other forms of transportation. Domestic airlines include Korean Airlines, Asiana Airlines, Jeju Air, Eastar Air, and Jin Air. These airlines operate along the following routes: Seoul/Incheon-Busan, Seoul/Incheon-Jeju, Seoul/Incheon-Daegu, Seoul-Ulsan, Seoul-Gwangju, Seoul-Jinhae, Seoul-Gangneung, etc. However, Jeju Air, Eastar Air, and Jin Air offer fewer routes. Tickets can be purchased at airports, or booked in advance by phone, internet, or through travel agencies.\n6>> Use of Public Administration 1_Public Administrative Bodies The main public administration offices include Eup Office, Myeon Office, Dong Community Center, City Office, Gun Office and Gu Office. These offices manage affairs related to the health and welfare of residents, the management of public facilities, the issuance of diverse certificates and the registration of diverse issues. Eup Offices, Myeon Offices and Dong Community Centers operate a wide range of programs, including cultural lectures for local residents. We can use the document issuance services at the automatic certificate issuance machines located at major subway stations or online (www.egov.go.kr). However, not every required certificate can be issued through the Internet or the automatic certificate issuance machine. In some cases, we cannot issue a document online without a printer and a certified authentication document. If you need to have an official document issued, please check the requirements in advance.\n2_Police Stations (\u260e 112) You can call 112 or visit a police station if you are a victim of fraud, violence, or burglary, are involved in a traffic accident, or witness an accident or crime. At public phones, simply press the red emergency button and dial 112, or dial 112 without the local code from a fixed line phone or a mobile phone. When reporting a crime, you must do your best to accurately report the address, the name and the contact information of the reporter (you) and the detailed circumstances of the event. Giving information on the appearance, characteristics, direction and method of the criminals\u2019 flight may help.\n3_Fire Stations (\u260e 119) You can call 119 when there is a fire, when you have to take someone to the hospital for emergency care, or when you witness<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " samples revealed presence of bovine rotavirus A in three diagnostic tests. The histopathological changes were found almost exclusively limited in the small intestine. The lesions of rotaviral enteritis ranged from slight to moderate shortening (atrophy) of villi in the jejunum and ileum with necrotic crypts. The villi were blunt and covered by immature epithelial cells. Infected cells, stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin staining method, showed characteristic syncytia and eosinophilc intracytoplasmic inclusion body. The presence of intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in enterocytes is the indication of viral etiology. The presence of rotavirus in the affected tissues and/or lesions was confirmed by three different immunological and molecular tests. The findings of histopathological changes will be helpful in future diagnosis of rotaviral infection in dead calves.\nStatement of the Problem: Diarrhea is a major cause of death in young calves. This causes great economic damage to the livestock industry. These diarrhea cause dehydration, decrease blood flow, lower the pH and degrade enzyme function. In the past, serum screening was not possible in the field. However, now with the spread of portable serum testing devices, it is now possible to conduct tests directly on field. Thus, accurate serological changes can be identified and used in the field of large animals. Methodology and Theoretical Orientation: The test groups were calves from 1 to 44 days old. The status of the feces was divided into four grade to determine the severity of diarrhea (grade 0,1,2,3). Grade 0, 1 is considered to have no diarrhea. Grade 2, 3 is considered to diarrhea positive group. One or more viruses were detected in this group. Diarrhea negasitive group consisted of 57 calves (Asan=30, Samrye=27). Diarrhea positive group consisted of 34 calves (Kimje=27, Geochang=7). The feces of all calves were analyzed by PCR Test. Blood sample was measured using an automatic blood analyzer(i-STAT, Abbott inc. Illinois, US). Calves were divided into 3 groups according to age. Group 1 is 1 to 14 days old. Group 2 is 15 to 28 days old. Group 3 is more than 28 days old. Findings: Diarrhea caused an increase in HCT due to dehydration. The difference from normal was highest in 15 to 28 days old (p < 0.01). At all ages, bicarbonate decreased compared to normal, and therefore pH decreased. Similar to HCT, the largest difference was observed between 15 and 28 days (p < 0.01). The pCO\u2082 decreases to compensate for the decrease in pH. Conclusion and Significance: At all ages, HCT increases, and bicarbonate, pH, and pCO\u2082 decrease in diarrhea calves. The calf from 15 days to 28 days shows the most difference from normal. Over 28 days of age, weight gain and homeostasis ability increase, diarrhea is seen in the stool, there are fewer hematologic changes than groups below 28 days of age.\nLivestock ownership is simultaneously linked to improved nutritional status through increased availability of animal-source protein, and increased risk of enteric infections through higher exposure to contaminated water sources. Agrarian and agro-pastoral households, especially those with cattle, goats, and sheep, are highly dependent on seasonally various environmental conditions, which directly impact nutrition and health. This study explores global spatiotemporally explicit evidence regarding the relationship between livestock ownership, enteric infections, and malnutrition. Seasonal and cyclical fluctuations, as well as mediating effects, are further examined to elucidate health and nutrition outcomes of individual and communal livestock ownership. The US Agency for International Development\u2019s Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund\u2019s Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) provide valuable sources of household-level information on anthropometry, asset ownership, and disease outcomes. These data are especially important in data-sparse regions, where surveys may only be conducted in the aftermath of emergencies. Child-level disease history, anthropometry, and household-level asset ownership information have been collected since DHS-V (2003-present) and MICS-III (2005-present). This analysis combines over 15 years of survey data from DHS and MICS to study 2,466,257 children under age five from 82 countries. Subnational (administrative level 1) measures of diarrhea prevalence, mean livestock ownership by type, mean and median anthropometric measures (height for age, weight for age, and weight for height) were investigated. Effects of several environmental, market, community, and household-level determinants were studied. Such covariates included precipitation, temperature, vegetation, the market price of staple cereals and animal source proteins, conflict events, livelihood zones, wealth indices and access to water, sanitation, hygiene, and public health services. Children aged 0 \u2013 6 months, 6 months \u2013 2 years, and 2 \u2013 5 years of age were compared separately. All observations were standardized to interview day of year, and administrative units were harmonized for consistent comparisons over time. Geographically weighted regressions were constructed for each outcome and subnational unit. Preliminary results demonstrate the importance of accounting for seasonality in concurrent assessments of malnutrition and enteric infections. Household assets, including livestock, often determine the intensity of these outcomes. In many regions, livestock ownership affects seasonal fluxes in malnutrition and enteric infections, which are also directly affected by environmental and local factors. Regression analysis demonstrates the spatiotemporal variability in nutrition outcomes due to a variety of causal factors. This analysis presents a synthesis of evidence from global survey data on the interrelationship between enteric infections, malnutrition, and livestock. These results provide a starting point for locally appropriate interventions designed to address this nexus in a timely manner and simultaneously improve health, nutrition, and livelihoods.\nEnterotoxigenic Escherichia coli is one of the leading causes of diarrhea in infants and travelers in developing countries. Colonization factors play an important role in pathogenesis and are one of the main targets for Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) vaccine development. However, ETEC vaccines had poorly performed in the past, as the prevalence of colonization factors is region-dependent. There are more than 25 classical colonization factors presently known to be expressed by ETEC, although all are not expressed together. Further, there are other multiple non-classical virulence factors that are also identified. Here the presence and expression of common classical and non-classical virulence factors were studied. Further studies were done on the expression of prevalent colonization factors in different strains. For the prevalence determination, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed, which was confirmed by simplex PCR. Quantitative RT-PCR was done to study the RNA expression of these virulence factors. Strains negative for colonization factors expression were confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Among the clinical isolates, the most prevalent toxin was est+elt, followed by est and elt, while the pattern was reversed in the control strains. There were 29% and 40% strains negative for any classical colonization factors (CF) or non-classical virulence factors (NCVF) among the clinical and control strains, respectively. Among CF positive ETEC strains, CS6 and CS21 were the prevalent ones in the clinical strains, whereas in control strains, CS6 was the predominant one. For NCVF genes, eatA was the most prevalent among the clinical isolates and etpA for control. CS6 was the most expressed CF, and eatA was the predominantly expressed NCVF for both clinical and controlled ETEC isolates. CS6 expression was more in strains having CS6 alone. Different strains express CS6 at different levels. Not all strains expressed their respective virulence factors. Understanding the prevalent colonization factor, CS6, and its nature of expression will contribute to designing an effective vaccine against ETEC in this region of the globe. The expression pattern of CS6 also will help in examining the relatedness between the ETEC subtypes.\nIsosporiasis is an affliction caused by coccidial protozoa belonging to genera Isospora spp. or Cystoisospora spp., which may parasitize the small and large intestines of dogs, of which neonates and young animals present higher risk of infection. This study aims at reporting a case of isosporiasis in neonate Pitbull dogs, as well as the diagnosis and treatment. Seven Pitbull puppies were admitted to the S\u00e3o Paulo State University (UNESP) Veterinary Hospital, Botucatu, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, with history of yellowish diarrhea without mucus or blood for the past two days. The animals were five days old. The history of the mother, a primiparous two-year-old, revealed that she was properly vaccinated, not de-wormed and did not present diarrhea. The clinical examination revealed that the neonates weighted between 308 and 360 grams, and presented normal reflexes, moderate dehydration, body temperatures between 36.8 and 37.2 \u00baC, blood sugar between 103 and 124 mg/dL and normal appetite. A full blood count and a parasitology assay were performed to aid in the diagnosis. The full blood count detected eosinophilia, without any other relevant alterations. The parasitology assay (Willis-Molly & Faust) revealed the presence of Cystoisospora spp. The treatment was instituted with heated fluid therapy with Ringer\u2019s Lactate (4 mL/100 g, subcutaneous) and antibiotic therapy with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (15 mg/kg, orally) every 12 hours for ten days. The mother and other dogs that came in contact with the newborns were also treated. The environment was disinfected for 10 minutes with 1.6% quaternary ammonium. After 10 days, the newborns presented normal clinical signs and no alterations in the full blood count. Isosporiasis is an affliction with high mortality rates in litters that should be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible to increase the survival rates in these patients.\nChildren<|endoftext|>"

The temple was established in 667 by the great Silla monk and philosopher, Wonhyo-daesa, who gave it the name Gogyeon-sa (\"temple seen in the past\") as he believed he had been here in a former life.\nIt has been an abode for the three famous monks Suneung, Ijeong, and Huirang, as well as being a place where Choi Chi-won, one of the great travelling Silla scholars, stayed.\nThe temple is home to Gogyeon-sa Stone Buddha, a large, fairly eroded seated buddha from the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392), an excellent metre high bronze bell, considered a masterwork of the 17th century artisan-monk Seolbong, and a giant, healthy Gingko tree at its entrance, said to be over 1000 years old.\nThe trail from Gogyeon-sa leaves from the back left of the temple, and it's a steep 800m hike north to the high ridge below Uiseong-bong. About halfway up to the ridge you'll encounter a massive bronze seated Buddha to the left of the trail in a rocky grotto.\nOur path meets the Janggun-bong-Udu-san trail in a high pass at the western foot of Uiseong-bong (1032m), a rocky tooth rising sharply from the ridge.\nTurning east the trail circles around the northern face of Uiseong-bong, bypassing it into it's eastern pass before climbing on toward Udu-san.\nThere is the option of climbing Uiseong-bong from its eastern side. A trail leaves the ridge heading west up Uiseong-bong a couple hundred metres to its summit, up an impressive case of a couple hundred stairs.\nIt's a worthy detour, Uiseong-bong is a great vantage point, with better views to the west and south down the valley than from Udu-san.\nFrom the base of Uiseong-bong it's only a 400m walk to Udu-san. From the eastern pass the trail climbs north-east up toothy ridge to a minor peak before turning more east for the final, quite steep climb to the summit.\nAbove: Udu-san (left) looking north-east along the Sudo-jimaek ridge toward Gaya-san, seen rising in the distance, and the south-eastern view from the summit (right), along the continuation of the Sudo-jimaek ridgeline to Bigye-san.\nFrom the summit our circuit heads south-east off the mountain, and soon drops into low forest which blankets the ridge to Bigye-san. It's a 2km walk to the pass of Majang-jae, which lies midway between Udu-san and the ridge junction to Bigye-san. The trail to the pass sticks to the line of the ridge, and there is an earlier option of heading down to the carpark 700m after leaving Udu-san.\nThe trail from Majang-jae heads south west down a steep gorge, 1.6km to the Gogyeon-sa entrance, passing Yongso-pokpo waterfall on the way.\nFor those who want to push further south east along the ridge, the trail heads a further 1.9km before reaching a rocky peak where a ridge shoulder rising from Gajo-myeon meets the Sudo-jimaek. A 3km trail runs southwest down this shoulder, ending up on the Gogyeon-sa - Gajo road to the northeast of town.\nThe ridge trail heads east from here, 800m to the summit of Bigye-san. A few hundred metres before reachng the peak a track heads south off the ridge 2km down to the Geochang/Gaso Hyugeso (rest area) on Expressway 12, about 4km west of town. This track passes through the mountain temple of Ilgak-sa - which I'd like to check out sometime, considering the Amaterasu legend - I believe its name means Sun-shrine-temple.\nBy Road: Expressway 12 (88 Olympic Expressway) running between Gwangju and Daegu has an exit at Gajo, between the exits of Geochang to the west and Haein-sa to the east. Getting off the expressway get on provincial road 1099 heading a short distance into the small town of Gajo, on the edge of town signs will direct you north-west across the plain about 3km to Udu-san, as shown in the photos at top.\nBy Bus: From Geochang Intercity Bus Terminal, regular city buses run to Gajo-myeon. They do not continue the 3km up to the temple carpark, you'll have to taxi to Gogyeon-sa, or stroll through the Higher Celestial Plain.\nGetting to Geochang: Buses to Geochang run from Dong-Seoul and Nambu terminals in Seoul. Also from Daejeon, Incheon, Gimcheon, Daegu, Gwangju, Busan and most cities in Gyeongsangnam-do.<|endoftext|>"

Changdeokgung is also known as the East Palace because its location east of Gyeongbok Palace. The literal meaning of Changdeokgung is \"Palace of Prospering Virtue.\"\nThe Changdeokgung palace was built between Peak Maebong of Mt. Bugaksan in the back and Rivulte Geumcheon having flowing in the front influenced by the principle \"baesanimsu\" in Feng Shui theory. Contrary to Gyeongbokgung whose main buildings are arranged in accurate architectural principle, however, buildings in Changdeokgung are disposed more freely without a regular system. Though its structure seems chaotic at a glace, all buildings are in harmony with the environment surrounding them.\nChangdeokgung was the favorite palace of many kings of the Joeseon Dynasty and still retains many Korean architectural elements dating from the Three Kingdoms of Korea period (1200-1300s). These elements differed from the then-popular and more formal style of times, as seen at Gyeongbokgung (Gyeongbok Palace). One major difference is that the buildings of Changdeokgung blend with the scenery of the area, vice contrasting like the palace at the Forbidden City in China.\nConstruction of Changdeok Palace began in 1405, was completed in 1412, and spanned 110 acres. The Palace was burned down during the Japanese invasion in 1592 and later reconstructed in 1609. Changdeokgung was the site of the royal court and the government until 1872, when the neighboring Gyeongbok Palace was rebuilt. Today, there are 13 buildings remaining on the palace grounds and 28 pavilions in the gardens.\nThe Changdeok Palace was burnt to the ground during the Japanese invasion in 1592 and reconstructed in 1609 by King Seonjo and King Gwanghaegun. The next arson was in 1623 because of King Injo Political Revolt against Gwanghaegun.
