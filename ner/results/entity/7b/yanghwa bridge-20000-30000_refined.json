        "passage": "Daesung is a main vocalist in the YG Entertainment Kpop group BIGBANG. Though his parents were initially against him becoming a singer, Daesung pursued his passion and successfully passed his audition at YG Entertainment. He debuted with BIGBANG on August 19, 2006 alongside Taeyang, G-Dragon, T.O.P, and Seungri.\nSoon after his debut with BIGBANG Daesung developed vocal chord nodules, which led him to struggle with his voice and develop stage fright. With the help of then-label mate Gummy, who suffered the same condition, Daesung eventually overcame his condition. Along with various group activities with BIGBANG, Daesung also pursued a solo career, interestingly enough, as a trot singer. He released his first trot single, \"Look at Me, Gwisoon\" in 2008 followed by \"Big Hit\" in 2009.\nIn August 2009, Daesung was injured in a car accident while returning to Seoul from filming a reality show. The accident occurred when the van hit the guard rail and skidded in the pouring rain. Daesung, who was sitting in the passenger seat, suffered a broken nose, a back injury, and sustained minor contusions on his arms and legs. Daesung was fully covered by October 2009, and rejoined BIGBANG for promotions starting then.\nOn May 31, 2011, Daesung was involved in another car accident, this time while at the wheel. The accident occurred while Daesung was driving home at approximately 1:30am one night. An intoxicated motorcyclist crashed his bike on Yanghwa Bridge, and while the car immediately in front of Daesung swerved to avoid the man laying in the street, Daesung did not have time to react and ran over him and hit a parked taxi that had seen him and pulled over. The motorcyclist had a high blood-alcohol content level of 0.18, likely the cause of his crash. For some time time it was unsure as to whether or not he was already dead when Daesung hit him. However, after a long period of deliberation and an extensive autopsy, forensic specialists found that the motorcyclist was indeed alive before Daesung hit him, and that Daesung was responsible for his death. Despite this, the investigation cleared Daesung of all charges, finding that the accident was not his fault as he was not intoxicated, though he was speeding.\nFollowing the accident, Daesung remained underground for 6 months, making no appearances and releasing no new material. He made his first public appearance at the MTV European Music Awards in November 2011, and made a comeback with BIGBANG in March 2012 with their new mini album, Alive.\nDaesung released his first Japanese solo album in February 2013, and has been consistently successful in Japan since. He has released 3 solo albums (two of which peaked at #1 on the Oricon chart) and headlined multiple Japanese tours as a solo artist over the past three years.<|endoftext|>"

Season 5 had some serious competition and although it didn\u2019t have the idol backing like the previous season, the popularity has been no joke. The Show Me The Money Concert Tour made a stop in Chicago and Los Angeles and was nothing short of AMAZING.\nEntering the Rosemont Theatre in Chicago, baseball caps filled the crowd at the 4,400 seated venue. Screams filled the room as promos for Crush\u2019s First Solo Tour teased the crowd as they anticipated the start of the show.\nAlthough Rosemont Theatre is all seated, everyone rose from their seats as soon as the concert started. SMTM riled up the crowd with an ode to old school hip-hop in a video graphic that featured New York-style graffiti and B-boying.\nThe crowd was already hyped but then Gil entered and accompanied Mad Clown in performing their special stage and the room filled with roars.\nAlthough Team Gil & Mad Clown were known for their awkward interactions this season, all of that was gone when they performed. Another video teaser started, and it became obvious that the teams would continue to perform in order of elimination from the show. That\u2019s when The Quiett entered the room. The crowd went wild as Illionaire has been quite popular in the U.S. for the past few years with their simple concept of providing no frills, hard hitting hip hop.\nIllionaire symbols filled the room and stayed up for Illionaire\u2019s full set of nine songs. Dok2 came on during the second song, \u201cBeverly Ills,\u201d which was obviously one of the crowd favorites.\nAlthough Dok2 and The Quiett had a longer set than most of the other performers, they kept their energy up and delivered their rhymes flawlessly. With their last song \u201c\uc5f0\uacb0\uace0\ub9ac (YGGR),\u201d they continuously built up the chorus which hyped up the crowd so much that the room was going insane! Thousands of voices repeated the lyrics until the duo left the stage.\nHe introduced his hit \u201cBeautiful\u201d by saying, \u201cDon\u2019t call me handsome boy, I\u2019m beautiful motherf**ker!\u201d and continued to do a four-song set.\nThe concert had been filled with hard hip-hop sounds all night and that\u2019s when Zion.T graced the stage with his soulful voice and popular song \u201c\ucff5 (Koong).\u201d The crowd went crazy as Zion.T hinted towards his three next songs and crowd kept guessing them right. Kush and C Jamm came back on for the SMTM hit \u201c Machine Gun\u201d before Zion. T finished with \u201cYanghwa Bridge.\u201d Of course Zion.T couldn\u2019t exit the stage without his signature bow.\nThe crowd had been anticipating the final team, AOMG, and when Gray hit the stage teasing the ladies with his \u201cSINGLE\u201d shirt and the whole room filled with screams. He performed \u201cDream Chaser\u201d and \u201cJust Do It\u201d solo before Simon D came on the stage.\nIt was obvious that Simon D was truly enjoying himself as he spoke English with the crowd. \u201cMusic is the one. Simon Dominic is the one.\u201d \u201cSimon Dominic is yours!\u201d and even made a fangirl\u2019s dream come true as he responded to her \u201cI love you\u201d with<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "nae here offers a whole song himself making his passion for music known by his voice. You can feel his emotions while singing and its pretty much one of the best covers he have so far (in my preference).\nJungkook with Rap Monster (back then) released a pre-debut cover in 2012 of the song \"Like A Star\" by J.Cole. Hearing a young Jeongguk singing along in English with Namjoon here rapping sounds so nostalgic and impressive at the same time. With such an arrangement and sampling, in an early age, these two have already proven how talented they were - with so much potential and skills.\nDecember 29, 2015 - SoundCloud upload here. What I love about their collaboration is that they compliment each other's vocal ranges. Troye Sivan's song not only showcased Jungkook's versatility but as well as RM potential in singing and that he can deliver it clean and amazingly good.\nDecember 25, 2014 - A rendition of Justin Bieber's Mistletoe which lyrics were written and changed by Jimin himself. This is a pretty sweet and lovely carol from the two vocalists of the group. I find it impressive that Jungkook's voice can be this cute, relax and the whole change on the arrangement of the song despite sounds nice. It brings me back some childhood memories whenever I hear their giggling laugh at the end.\nYOU'RE MY with the full Vocal Line Jimin, Jin and V from original song of BIGBANG Taeyang.\nJeon Jungkook as BTS Main Vocalist and youngest member has participated the MBC Entertainment's THE KING OF MASK SINGER episode 71 last August 7, 2016 while singing to BIGBANG's \"If You\" and his beautiful live performance took over the crowd by a surprise. His interpretation of the song is amazing! I mean, he can even steal million of hearts just by his sweet voice even, to be very honest. On this link he was identified as the Golden Maknae.\nFrom the same episode of \"The King of Mask Singer\" Jungkook also sung with Lady Jane as Archery Girl. Their collaboration or rather 1on1 round was pretty impressive, hearing its studio version sounds beautiful and romantic. I'd be glad to hear him sing with other artists more, may it be female idols, I won't mind.\nAn original tweet from BTS Twitter page last September 24, 2014 was Jungkook's full recording or song cover or Zion.T's Yanghwa Bridge click here for the SoundCloud upload.\nOne year after, KBS World have Jungkook performed with Zion.T himself during the 2015 KBS Song Festival (held on Jan 23, 2016). It's a dream come true for the young artist to be able to collaborate with his sunbaenim/idol for such a beautiful and meaningful song on stage.\nYB - A Flying Butterfly stage by 20-year-old idols participated by Jungkook with his fellow K-artists of the same line in the industry (during 2016 KBS Song Festival). What I love on this stage? Well, BTS Maknae slays! His amazing intro brought a great impression of the whole show/presentation and successful!\nBTS members here on their bad boy vibes dancing along with Jungkook on his vocal cover of Rainism (Rain) as they performed old kpop songs. I just feel like including this on this blog as the last from the list because he technically brought them all powerfully. His breakdance was a definition of smooth, sexy and strong in combo. Center Jungkook definitely owned their stage in MMF2016!\n\u2022 Marry Me Jungkook here singing Jason Derulo's Marry Me on his own version from a clip/episode of American Hustle Life.\n\u2022 Dear No One during a Vlive broadcast with Taehyung.\n\u2022 See You Again Jungkook singing to Wiz Khalifa's in a video tweet.\n\u2022 Half Moon from a solo vlive broadcast clip where he was singing while on sound trip.\n\u2022 Contrail another beautiful song from Moon Moon which he sung during a live broadcast.\n\u2022 Boyfriend in a guesting for AfterSchoolClud, Jungkook sings part of Justin Bieber's Boyfriend while Jhope was beatboxing.\n\u2022 Eyes, Nose, Lips an M2 clip of Taehyung and Jungkook enjoying a videoke moment together, they chose Taeyang's hit song and harmonized well..\n\u2022 See Through young Kookie having a vocal practice during their pre-debut days.\n\u2022 Two Melodies during an audition for SOPA (School of Performing Arts) and he was 15 years old only when he shows off his talent and work his way to be an idol he is at the moment.\nJungkook is such a versatile singer, he's vocal range is impressive and it's stability is outstanding may it be live or recorded. He's been practicing for years and looking up to many idols while he makes a lot of cover songs from the hit ones or his favorites/influences. He practice English songs and even more so recording some pieces on his own style and discover his abilities. I'm not a vocal professional myself but I can say that Jungkook's has long run to take of his career because of his talent and determination. He has this passion one couldn't replicate.\nWe've been enjoying his cover songs for years and ready to face his anticipated mixtape. He is producing music, composing lyrics and directing his own videography/films (G.C.F.) - like what more of a surprise do we except from a Golden Maknae?\nThank you for making your way to the end of this blog. :hearts: What's your favorite cover song?\nWhen Jimin & Jungkook Collab..<|endoftext|>"

Deployed from 1991 to 2016, the sub patrolled and surveilled from behind enemy lines. Inside the museum, curators bisected the sub and exposed its innards to the paying public.\nBut why build a naval museum in Mangwon Park?\nFrom the birth of kingdoms to the Korean War, armies and navies wrestled for control over the Han River. Whomever controlled the waterway ruled the peninsula.\nAnd the Joseon Dynasty\u2019s navy once used this section of river to practice with their warships.\nHow much is a museum ticket?

When planning my trip to South Korea, I decided that I wanted to give cycling in Seoul a try. I thought it would be a great way to get my bearings and explore the city. So as soon as I dropped my bags at the hostel, I headed out for my first adventure. I decided to follow my guidebook\u2019s advice and hire a bike to head on a self-guided tour of Yeouido and the Hangang River area.\nI jumped on the subway and made my way to Yeouido \u2013 a huge island that\u2019s home to Seoul\u2019s main financial district. Some of the city\u2019s (and even South Korea\u2019s) tallest skyscrapers are located on Yeouido but I wasn\u2019t here for the buildings. I headed towards the river and the Yeouido Hangang Park \u2013 a sprawling green space along the banks of the Hangang River.\nI found the small bike rental hut after a few minutes strolling the park\u2019s clean paths. There was a price list in Korean and English and I decided that two hours would be enough for me to complete the 15km route I planned to do. 5000 won (\u00a33.50/$4.70) would get me a \u201csingle\u201d classic bike while splashing out 10000 won (\u00a36.70/$9.40) would land me an \u201cadvanced\u201d bike which I soon figured out was a hybrid bike. I decided I was advanced enough to go for the latter.\nAfter handing over my passport as a deposit (you can use any photo ID), I was handed my shiny bike and I was on my way! It was sunny and warm \u2013 I avoided the worst of the midday heat \u2013 as I set off to explore.\nI cycled west through Hangang Park past strolling couples, friends relaxing in inflatable donuts and kids splashing around in the stream. I stopped to check out a sculpture of a monster from a famous Korean movie \u201cThe Host\u201d that visitors are encouraged to climb. The nearby \u201cI SEOUL U\u201d sign \u2013 the capital\u2019s official slogan \u2013 offered great views of the city skyline across the river. The park seemed like a great place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. UPDATE: The I SEOUL U sign location has changed a number of times since March 2018. Let me know if you spot it somewhere different in the city!\nI headed out of the park and up the ramp onto the busy Mapo Bridge. I cycled across and took the ramp down to the North bank of the Han River. There were a lot more cyclists on this side and a dedicated cycle lane that went along the river. Biking in Seoul appeared to be just as popular as it is in London!\nI was surprised to notice an outdoor gym just a little further. As it turned out, Koreans love to keep active and this became a common sight throughout my visit! I couldn\u2019t resist a mini workout and did a few sets of the bench press! I also got talking to some locals who came up to me and asked me questions about where I am from and what I was doing Korea. I\u2019ve only been in the country a few hours and was already experiencing its incredible hospitality!\nI continued my riverside bike ride, passing a gym every couple of minutes. If I stopped at every single one, I\u2019d be packing some serious muscle by the end of the ride! There were also locals playing something resembling bowls and croquet but I couldn\u2019t really figure out what they were doing! The views on this side of the river weren\u2019t as good, as the path traced a busy carriageway but once in a while I caught a glimpse of Yeouido and its skyscrapers and greenery on the other side.\nAfter a few kilometres I reached a cliff with a building adorned by a cross. This was the Jeoldusan Martyrs Shrine, where in 1866 up to 2000 Korean Catholics were executed and thrown into the Han River. Jeoldusan means \u201cBeheading Hill\u201d in Korean \u2013 I am glad I wasn\u2019t visiting during the night as I can imagine it would be quite creepy.\nIt was time to cross the river back to the south side and after carrying the bike up the steps to Yanghwa Bridge, I cycled past the entrance to Seonyudo Park which occupies an island in the middle of the river. I didn\u2019t have time to explore it but I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s a great place to wander around or enjoy a drink at the caf\u00e9.\nOnce on the other side, I stopped to check another outdoor gym right under the bridge. Among the fitness equipment, pillars supporting the bridge each sported colourful music and film themed murals. I thought it was a really cool way to utilise what would otherwise be a drab space that you wouldn\u2019t give a second glance.\nI rode on down the tree-lined lane and soon made it back to the western tip of Yeouido. There was a fork in the road. Before continuing along the route, I took a detour to check out the Seoul Marina and the National Assembly building (heading down the right path in the photo). Back at the fork, I turned left and headed under the bridge you can see on the left side of the photo.\nThe route heads down the quieter southern part of Yeoudo island along the greenery of Yeouido Saetgang Ecological Park. It\u2019s the first eco park of its kind in Korea and was designed to preserve the ecosystem of the area and educate visitors about flora and fauna in the area. I stopped a few times to wander along the boardwalks that take you closer to nature. I really enjoyed the peace and quiet of the area, even with the towering skyscrapers visible in the background.\nAfter the relaxing stretch through the Eco Park, I reached the eastern end of Yeouido and started heading back towards Hangang Park and the start of my ride. This part of the island is notable for 63 SQUARE, a towering skyscraper and one of Korea\u2019s tallest and most recognised buildings. There is an observatory deck offering impressive views of Seoul, restaurants and even an aquarium!\nI was soon back in Hangang Park, cycling past ice cream stalls and restaurants set just offshore on a pier. Visitors could also hire swan boats to explore the river.\nI managed to cover 15 km in my two allotted hours and still had a few minutes spare when I handed my bike over. I stretched my legs with a stroll through the park, enjoying the late afternoon sun and multiple iced coffees I bought to rehydrate! As first days go in a foreign country, this was a pretty good one!\nIf you liked this post, check out my other blogs on South Korea!\nWhere: Yeouido, Seoul, South Korea.\nGetting There: Subway Line 5 to Yeouinaru, take exit 3 and follow signs to Hangang Cruise Terminal in Yeouido Hangang Park.\nThis entry was posted in South Korea and tagged bike, bike rental, cycling, Han River, riding, seoul, south korea, Yeouido.\nIt\u2019s awesome exploring a new city on a bicycle! Gives you a different perspective of a place.\nThe music and film themed murals are awesome.\nThanks for sharing for this weeks #TheWeeklyPostcard and #FeetdoTravel!\nThanks Vicky \u2013 so colourful aren\u2019t they!?\nSeoul has done some incredible work on transforming spaces to make them more green and people-friendly. There are loads of initiatives like that in the city! Really refreshing to see!\nWe\u2019ve never rented bikes while we travel although I say it would be nice! I don\u2019t know why we don\u2019t! I\u2019ve only done a bike tour is Barcelona and that was hectic! Hills and traffic don\u2019t mix well when you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going! Thanks for linking up with #TheWeeklyPostcard!\nAh I can understand when it\u2019s busy and you are riding in built up areas but this was pretty relaxing and I never felt intimidated by other cyclists and there were no roads to cross! Hopefully you will get a chance to rent a bike someday soon!\nWe walked the parks along the Han River when we were there in May \u2013 but we saw lots of<|endoftext|>"

They now tie G-Dragon, BoA, and T-ara for second-most top 10's; only 2NE1, with 12, have more.\nZion.T only continues to grow with each release. Determined to go up the latter one rung at a time, his latest single \"Yanghwa Bridge\" enters at #8, following the #9 \"Miss Kim\" and the #10 \"Babay\" from last year. It is his 3rd solo top 10 and his 4th overall including his feature on Primary's 2012 #7 hit \"?\".\nTROY invade the top 10 for a second time this year; while their debut single \"GREEN LIGHT\" took its time to reach a #7 peak, their latest, \"Why are we?\", goes straight in at #10.\nOutside the top 10 rookie group MINX send their awkwardly-translated debut single \"Why Did You Come To My Home?\" in at #12, while #SLAYSTAR member #SLAYOU aka Soyu #SLAYS the chart to pieces at #14 with her Urban Zakapa duet \"The Space Between\".\nLastly there are two certs to get to - SISTAR make it to 1 million points with \"Touch My Body\" in a breakneck 10 weeks. It is the group's 3rd Platinum single, putting them in select company with 2NE1, After School and CRAYON POP as the only acts with 3 or more Platinum hits. It is the 31st Platinum single on our chart. 2NE1 finally crosses platinum with \"Happy\" after 20 weeks. It is the group's 8th Platinum single, only further extending their record for most singles over 1 million points. It is the 32nd Platinum single on our charts.\nI'm so happy Happy finally made it to Platinum. I'm probably in the minority, but it's my favourite track on CRUSH.\nMINX - Why Did You Come To My Home?\nTROY - Why are we?\nSorry for being so late with last week's video, I should have by this weekend the have this weeks up some time of the beginning of next week!\n2PM - Go Crazy!\nTROY- Why Are We?\nBut I haven't heard it yet... But I promise I'll get around to that soon.\nI love the song itself, but IU's voice in it annoys the heck out of me to the point where I just want to listen to an instrumental...\nCalm down, I have now listened to it.\nLast day to request!\nIgnore the little screw up with 'Eyes, Nose, Lips\" being small in both videos...<|endoftext|>"

It's about them moving to a different dorm but in Suga, J-Hope, and Rap Mon's raps there's a personal story of how they were before they debuted and their struggles. Even though it's a song that seems like a letter to the members, it's really relatable especially if you're facing major changes in your life. It's such a beautiful song and it's really special, knowing what the lyrics mean just makes it more beautiful. \n\nAnd of course, Zion. T's Yanghwa Bridge is incredibly beautiful if you understand the lyrics. It's about his life but we can relate in a way of not wanting to grow up n<|endoftext|>"
