Today, the Korean restaurant, teahouse, performance hall and guest quarters are a popular urban getaway to enjoy traditional architecture, cuisine and music.\nAs you take a look around, you\u2019ll probably notice there are six buildings. Ilhwadang Hall is the grandest (and the only structure built with concrete), and it\u2019s where the restaurant and tea house are located. Three smaller halls, the Dongbaekheon Chamber, and the Yuhajeong Pavilion are also set amongst landscaped grounds and an extensive network of gorgeous traditional stone, wood and tile walls.\nIsn\u2019t it relaxing?\nCome back soon for a romantic dinner date!\nAfter a leisurely stroll around Samcheonggak, let\u2019s head back to the Information Center. Once there, we must register with our passports or Alien Registration Cards at the Information Center. After just a couple of minutes, we\u2019ll receive a neck pass and off we go!\nyoung soldiers (in park uniforms) patrol the area.\nOctober and 10:00~17:00 from Nov. to March.\nIt\u2019s about a five-minute hike to Seoul Fortress\u2019 great north gate, Sukjeongmun. You may have already seen one of Seoul\u2019s other major gates \u2013 the great east gate best known as Dongdaemun. If so, you\u2019ll notice that the north gate is a lot smaller. In fact, Sukjeongmun\u2019s colorful wood ramparts weren\u2019t even built until 1976. That\u2019s because it was built to satisfy feng shui principles more than accommodate traffic.\nWhile you\u2019re on the gate, enjoy the view because soon you\u2019ll be breathing heavily. Your reward for the climb? Spectacular views of the city! And before you know it, we\u2019ll reach Baegakmaru, the name of Bugaksan\u2019s 342-meter peak. At this point, Namsan Seoul Tower is to the left and Gwanghwamun Square and Gyeongbokgung Palace are right below us!\nThe trip back down is pretty steep, but along the way you can enjoy the view of Bukhansan\u2019s (Mt.) dorsal fin-shaped peak. The mountain marks Seoul\u2019s northern boundary. Before you know it, we\u2019ll pass the Dolgorae Rest Area and just a few hundred meters later, we\u2019ll enter the peaceful hamlet of Buam-dong. Before exiting the Changuimun Information Center, don\u2019t forget to drop your neck pass into the basket!\nBack on the trail, it\u2019s about a five-minute hike to Seoul Fortress\u2019 great north gate, Sukjeongmun. You may have already seen one of Seoul\u2019s other major gates \u2013 the great east gate best known as Dongdaemun. If so, you\u2019ll notice that the north gate is a lot smaller.\nIn fact, Sukjeongmun\u2019s colorful wood ramparts weren\u2019t even built until 1976. That\u2019s because it was built to satisfy feng shui principles more than accommodate traffic.\nBefore we head for lunch in Buam-dong, let\u2019s take a few minutes to view Changuimun, the secondary fortress gate better known as Jahamun. The gate\u2019s wooden top section dates to 1741, which makes it the oldest of Seoul Fortress\u2019s remaining gates. Under the archway are colorful painted phoenixes \u2013 or maybe they\u2019re roosters?\nUp ahead is another tunnel, which marks the entrance into Buam-dong. This quiet neighborhood feels far from downtown Seoul. Indeed, one shop owner described it as, \u201ctoo quiet for a serious business.\u201d Maybe so, but it\u2019s a great place for lunch! Case in point is Cheers!, which specializes in some of the crispiest and juiciest fried chicken Seoul has to offer. It\u2019s served alongside amazing fried potato wedges and a spicy-sweet dipping sauce and tastes great with a pint of draft beer. That sounds like the perfect way to celebrate our successful hike!\nWhen you walk underneath Changuimun\u2019s grand arch, you\u2019ll see two winged beasts. While they\u2019re not dragons, some think the official explanation is dubious. According to the signboards, the colorful animals are phoenixes, the mythical firebird from ancient cultures ranging from Egypt to China. But a folk tale suggests a more humble heritage. The birds are possibly chickens \u2013roosters, to be exact. Given the Fortress\u2019 long, centipede-like shape, its natural enemy would be the rooster. Achieving balance \u2013 the yin and yang \u2013 was of critical importance in ancient Korea, so Changuimun\u2019s chickens were said to repress the centipede\u2019s energy, thus creating harmony. So, what do you think they look like?\nIf fried chicken doesn\u2019t suit you, next-door is Rabia, which serves yummy Italian fare. Or, turn right at the intersection to find a couple of restaurants, caf\u00e9s, a bakery specializing in cupcakes and a flower shop on the main drag. If a jolt of caffeine is what you need, across the street from Cheers! is Club Espresso, a large caf\u00e9 that\u2019s been dedicated to the fine art of coffee since 1990. Got even more time to burn? Check out the popular Whanki Museum.\nBefore the post-lunch sleepiness sets in, let\u2019s get back on the road. This time it\u2019s a walk down a tree-lined street boasting great views of red tile roofs and the city. We\u2019ll pass a bronze statue of Police Commissioner Choi Gyu-sik who was killed by North Korean spies in 1968.\nAfter about a kilometer, we\u2019ll arrive at Cheongwadae Sarangchae, an exhibition and museum space showcases the history of the Korean presidency, government initiatives and aspects of Korean culture that are popular around the globe. The word \u201csarangchae\u201d refers to a detached room in traditional Korean manors where men would entertain fellow male guests.\nOnce we\u2019ve had our fill of the exhibits, I suggest checking out the souvenir store that\u2019s located next to the lobby. There\u2019s a surprising mix of interesting and high-quality items about Seoul and Korea. It\u2019s a great place to stock up on gifts for family and friends back home!\nAlthough Gyeongbokgung Palace was originally built in the late 14th century, it was burned to the ground during Japan\u2019s Hideyoshi invasions after some 200 years. When King Gojong rebuilt the palace in 1868, he created a virtual city with over 300 buildings covering 64 hectares. In fact, ancient Seoul\u2019s five palaces formed a royal compound that was second only to Beijing\u2019s Forbidden City. Sadly, when the Japanese government annexed Korea in 1910, it razed 90% of the royal buildings and gardens.\nToday, both the president\u2019s official residence, Cheongwadae, and the Cheongwadae Sarangchae are located on former palace grounds.\nOnce we\u2019ve finished our tour of the Cheongwadae Sarangchae, our tour is almost complete! But before we say goodbye, let\u2019s take a final stroll along another famous city wall. It\u2019s not part of the fortress wall, but it\u2019s the stately western wall of Gyeongbokgung Palace. Gyeongbokgung was the primary royal residence of Seoul during the late Joseon Dynasty. At the end of the wall is a busy intersection. Turn right and you\u2019ll quickly reach exit 4 of Seoul Metro Line 3\u2019s Gyeongbokgung Station.\n\u2026which is where our tour of Seoul\u2019s fortress and palace walls comes to an end!\nI hope you enjoyed seeing the city with me.\nThanks for coming along and let\u2019s do it again soon!<|endoftext|>(Bank draft | Commercial) If one sees himself paying someone a fee to write him a bill of exchange, or a bank draft in a dream, it means that he will borrow some money to do business and that he will profit from his investment to become known in his field.

        "passage": " divided. When that happens, leaders face a dilemma: they can advocate for the point of view they think is right, or they can work to hold the community together. Most of the time community is more important\u2014but not always.\nSome fences are just too hard to straddle. It\u2019s fine to say, \u201cWe\u2019re one big family. We agree to disagree.\u201d But when the disagreement is about a matter of fundamental principle, such as who can be recognized as a full member of the family, it\u2019s not so simple.\nToday a number of denominations\u2014including the United Methodist Church\u2014are struggling over how and whether to ordain gay and lesbian people. The easiest difference for outsiders to see is simply between \u201cprogressives\u201d who want to recognize a wider range of people and \u201cconservatives\u201d who hold to older standards of acceptable behavior.\nBut another difference is more visible to the participants themselves\u2014between those whose first priority is to achieve what they think is the right outcome and those who want to hold the community together.\nI first encountered this dilemma when I was in college, writing for the student paper. The local Episcopal church was divided over women\u2019s ordination. Almost all the members of that congregation agreed that the church should ordain women\u2014but some wanted it to happen through an orderly decision process while others insisted it should happen right away.\nThis situation was hard to explain to my student editors, who kept trying to simplify the story into a battle between \u201cliberals\u201d and \u201cconservatives.\u201d It was hard for them to understand how anyone was willing to live with the suppression of women\u2019s gifts and calling\u2014even temporarily\u2014if that\u2019s what it took to bring everyone along.\nChurch or sect?\nSome faith traditions specialize in righteous action to right wrongs, while others favor unity, even at the cost of ambiguity about important points. Each denomination transmits family traditions about how to handle this dilemma, often by telling stories about faith heroes.\nIf we talk about prophetic souls who clung to the right even unto martyrdom, we frame ourselves as a \u201csect\u201d\u2014an outpost of purity against prevailing views. But if we speak with pride of famous presidents and business leaders who once belonged to our faith group, or recall the days when the town high school held its graduation in our sanctuary, we\u2019re seeing ourselves in \u201cchurchly\u201d terms\u2014as a religious home for everyone in the community.\nOf course none of us inherits one tradition pure. Most of us resonate with both the \u201csect\u201d idea of holding to the right regardless of the cost and the \u201cchurchly\u201d hope of holding a diversity of viewpoints under one big tent. We all know people who belong to congregations for all kinds of reasons\u2014habit, family, music\u2014that have little to do with their opinions on theology or social issues.\nWho counts as a member?\nThe broad-church style has great appeal: \u201cIf we agree in love, no disagreement can do us any harm. If we do not agree in love, no other agreement can do us any good.\u201d This broad-church sentiment and others like it have been attributed to the founders of a number of denominations.\nBut the \u201cchurchly\u201d way of understanding faith community is often founded on unstated assumptions about who counts as a full member. Once upon a time it seemed normal to ask a woman to join a church that put a ceiling on her leadership. More recently, congregations plausibly could say they loved gay people\u2014so long as they stayed closeted and celibate. Still today, many congregations that claim to be inclusive hold transgender people at arm\u2019s length.\nThe \u201cbroad church\u201d idea depends on a certain level of consensus about who counts. That\u2019s why many of our most established churches split over slavery and the Civil War, and it\u2019s why so many churches have split\u2014or will split soon\u2014over boundaries to inclusion based on sexuality and gender. When people become fully visible, it is no longer plausible to claim to be inclusive while excluding them.\nIn our time, when religious affiliation has become an option rather than an obligation, congregations need to declare their principles out loud in order to project a clear identity. This situation favors splitting over holding too wide a range of viewpoints in one space. Two congregations, each committed to consistent principles, may fare better in a marketplace of people who increasingly demand reasons to affiliate at all.\nFor leaders, straddling the fence feels sensible and safe. A little ambiguity can go a long way when it comes to holding a community together. Until it doesn\u2019t. Some issues are too central to a congregation\u2019s purpose and identity to fudge. Excluding people in the name of keeping \u201ceverybody\u201d under one big tent makes no sense at all.\nOne of my church clients posed a profound question to itself: \u201cWhat are the core values for which we would sacrifice our unity?\u201d It\u2019s a worthwhile question for a congregation of integrity to ponder. Straddling the fence can be a good move tactically, but sometimes leaders have to make a choice.<|endoftext|>Hiking Seoul Fortress (\uc11c\uc6b8\uc131\uacfd) is one of the best ways to experience a conspicuous remnant of Seoul\u2019s ancient past.\nFirst constructed in 1396 \u2013 just five years after King Taejo founded the Joseon Dynasty \u2013 the earthen wall was built to join the ridge lines of the four small mountains that surrounded Seoul proper \u2013 Namsan (\ub0a8\uc0b0) in the south, Inwangsan (\uc778\uc655\uc0b0) to the west, Naksan (\ub099\uc0b0) to the east, and Bugaksan (\ubd81\uc545\uc0b0) in the North.\nAlthough much of the old Seoul Fortress wall has been torn down, significant portions remain and others are being rebuilt.\nAs you\u2019re hiking Seoul Fortress, you can tell from the size and shape of the stones which era in which it was built. The original walls, built in the late 14th century were constructed of medium-sized round stones held together by mud.\nThe next major expansion, which took place during King Sejong the Great\u2019s reign in the mid 15th century, are marked by rectangular stones closely fit together.\nAnother major restoration in 1704 was when King Sukjong rebuilt sections of the wall using large, uniform stone slabs joined so tightly that even a sheet of paper can\u2019t fit in-between.\nAmong what\u2019s left of the Seoul Fortress wall, the stretch from Bugaksan to Inwangsan mountains provide some of the best preserved stretches that, along with spectacular views, make for a great day hike.\nRecently reopened to the public, the trail begins at Waryong Park (\uc640\ub8e1\uacf5\uc6d0). Turning left after a short break in the wall, the trail leads past a virtual tunnel of blooming vines.\nA boardwalk extends throughout the forest, whose canopy provides welcome relief from the summer sun. After several hundred meters, the forest gives way to open sky, and the upscale neighborhood of Seongbuk-dong (\uc131\ubd81\ub3d9) comes into view.\nOnce you reach the Sukjeongmun gate Rest Area, it\u2019s mandatory that visitors register with the office. It takes just a couple of minutes to furnish your passport, provide your contact information, receive a badge, and then your on your way to see the Great Northern Gate, Sukjeongmun (\uc219\uc815\ubb38).\nAmong the four main gates that mark each of the cardinal points, Sukjeongmun is the smallest. Primarily constructed to comply with geomantic principles, it\u2019s mountain-top location meant it didn\u2019t see much traffic.\nNevertheless, from its perch on the slopes of Bugaksan, a great view of northern Seoul can be had.\nWhile hiking Seoul Fortress, every 200 meters or so you\u2019re bound to see a young man patrolling the area.\nFriendly but hardly chatty, their presence reminds you that this area just north of the presidential house and less than two hours from the border with North Korea, remains a highly sensitive area as it was centuries ago.\nWith that in mind, photos are, for the most part, restricted, but the views from on high are definitely worth the trek, even if you can\u2019t keep a memento.\nAfter reaching Bugaksan\u2019s 342 meter peak, it\u2019s time to wind your way back down. As the trail becomes increasingly steep, you\u2019ll thank me for taking you on the westward route.\nAfter the precipitous descent, the stately secondary gate of Changuimun (\ucc3d\uc758\ubb38) signals your arrival in the peaceful hamlet of Buam-dong (\ubd80\uc554\ub3d9), and just in time for lunch!\nOpen: Most sections are open 24 hours. However, the section between Waryong Park and Changuimun\u2019s hours vary. Closed Mondays.\nDirections: The Mt. Bugaksan section of the Seoul Fortress can be accessed via Anguk Station on Seoul Metro Line 3 (exit #2). Immediately outside the exit is a bus stop. Take bus #02 to the Sungkyunkwan University rear gate.<|endoftext|>Science sure is neat when it is either presented in a way that doesn\u2019t put you to sleep, or is so mind-blowingly interesting that you couldn\u2019t possibly fall asleep.
