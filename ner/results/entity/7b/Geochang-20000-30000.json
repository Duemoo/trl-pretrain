The three people spoke to USA TODAY Sports on the condition of anonymity since they were not authorized to speak publicly due to ongoing negotiations.\nThe proposal instead includes a sliding scale of compensation, with players earning the most taking the biggest cuts and those earning the least receiving most of their guaranteed salaries.\nIt remains uncertain how much money the players will be yielding in this proposal, based on no fans in attendance for an 82-game season, after already agreeing to be paid on a pro-rated basis, reducing their pay by almost 50%.\nYet revenue sharing was not referenced at all in the document that was prepared for the union.\nThe union was concerned that the revenue sharing would lead to the introduction of a salary cap in future negotiations, while wary of further pay reductions, including the possibility of a percentage of their salaries placed in escrow.\nThe owners insist they will lose money during the regular season without fans in attendance, but would be guaranteed $777 million in postseason TV revenue, which would be inflated to about $1 billion with the postseason format expanded to 14 teams instead of 10.\nThere\u2019s no hard deadline for the negotiations to be completed, but the two sides would likely need to reach an agreement in seven to 10 days if the season can begin the first week of July.<|endoftext|>It\u2019s time to meet the boys of Riverdale.

However, the pandemic may affect adversely the Group's ability to implement its planned development programmes for the coming year - whether due to logistical challenges, such as the curtailment of international flights; the unavailability of mining personnel, equipment or materials or governmental restrictions which may be imposed in any of the jurisdictions in which the Group it operates.

Many opportunities are presented in the form of old underground gold mines which can be re-opened, a process with which the Company's Management team has substantial experience.\n\u00b7 the overall cost to reopen is far cheaper per ounce than new ounces at the same grade.\nSouth Korea is a modern, industrialised economy, a representative democracy and has substantial infrastructure advantages, in many respects, superior to western jurisdictions. South Korea is an investment grade country with Moodys and Standard & Poors ratings of AA and Aa2 respectively.\nThe past year has seen the farm-in arrangement with Southern Gold completed and South Korean joint ventures established for each of the two projects. BMV operates both the Gubong Project Company and the Geochang[1] Project Company.\nTo the end of December 2019, the Company had incurred USD 1,405,778 of farm-in expenditure. These costs were expensed through the Company's consolidated income statement, in line with accounting policies, and were a requirement for the formation of the Gubong and Kochang joint ventures with Southern Gold Ltd.\nThe project is just over one hour's drive west of Daejeon, the second largest city in South Korea. Access to the site is by sealed roads to within 100 metres of the old mine. Other infrastructure such as power and telecommunications are also placed conveniently.\nGubong was South Korea's second largest gold producer historically and the largest during 1930-1943, during the Japanese occupation. It still retains substantial remnant ore between mined blocks and excellent exploration potential. Mine data indicates good potential for mine re-commissioning and the possibility of relatively early cash flow.\nThere is a dearth of information considering the age of the mine and there is anecdotal evidence that the information relating to gold production is understated as there was little government control over the Japanese mining companies.\nThere are no declared JORC resource estimates currently at Gubong.\nThe immediate Gubong project area hosts five historical underground mines with the largest being the Gubong mine which exploited high grade quartz veins hosted in gneissic granite and mined to a vertical depth of approximately 500 metres.\nHistoric underground sampling results of the deeper levels of Vein 6, the main vein exploited at Gubong, gives an arithmetic uncut average of 30.6 g/t gold from 146 values. Exploratory core drilling below the now abandoned mine workings from one of five holes returned 27.9 g/t gold and 25 g/t silver over 1.6 metres downhole from 845.2 metres. This demonstration of the persistence with depth of the most developed mineralised structure supports the prospectivity of the property for auriferous shoots with considerable depth continuity.\nInterestingly, Vein 6 was found as a blind vein in the hanging wall during mine development work on the other veins. This suggests substantial gold resources may be found in parallel vein systems that do not outcrop in the area.\nThere has been no physical work undertaken at Gubong in the period to 31 December 2019. An application for a \"Permit to Develop\" the mine was submitted in late December 2018. The process was supposed to have taken 2 months however, the Provincial Government took a lot longer to review the submission and in May decided to defer the decision to a higher authority. The committee appointed to review the submission sat for a final decision on 30 August 2019 and issued their approval of the \"Permit to Develop\" on 10 September 2019.\nThe Kochang Mine began in 1928 but production records started in 1938 with the Nippon Mining Co which mined until 1942. Production restarted in 1961 and was fairly constant until 1975.\nThe workings extend over 1.2-1.5 km (2.5 km including the silver shaft area) from south west to north east and extend down dip to about 120 m below surface. The workings exploit 5-7 veins striking 050o with a dip of 50-70NW. There seem to have been 4 shafts (North shaft, south shaft, main shaft and silver shaft). The gold and silver mines have been worked as separate mines in the past but recent work suggests that they are part of the same deposit and that resources may extend between them.\nFollowing the last year of recorded production in 1975, exploratory level development was carried out in 1981 and 1990, presumably by KORES. Korean underground plans dated 1990 show the results of the sampling of quartz veins along portions of the gold mine at Kochang. In aggregate, a total of 104 underground samples are depicted with gold results ranging from 0.4 g/t up to 102.6 g/t for sample widths ranging from 0.03 metres to 0.6 metres in thickness. The length weighted average value of all the underground samples is 17.05 g/t gold over 0.2 metres.\nOf further interest is a particularly well mineralised 120 metre length of Vein 3 at the southern end of the prospecting drive on 245RL which gave a length weighted average value of 57.27 g/t gold over a 0.29 metre width: indicating the presence of higher grade ore shoots at Kochang. Bonanza grades were reportedly mined from upper levels of the north shaft vein.\nIn 1984, four inclined core holes were drilled at Kochang, but their coordinates are generally unknown. Each hole intersected narrow quartz veins. Two of the holes were sampled for assay over intersections of interest. One drill hole 84-2 was collared in a new deposit called the Sanpo Mine at 238 RL, azimuth of 225 and dip 70. Of the nine results reported, Hole 84-2 gave two intersections above 1 g/t gold in one hole. The intersections were 10.6 g/t gold and 12 g/t silver over 0.6 metres from 26.9 metres and 17.6 g/t gold and 4 g/t silver over 2.5 metres from 63.0 metres respectively. At 97.6 metres a 2.4m vein gave trace gold and 1,763 g/t silver.\nThis drill hole opens up a \"new\" parallel mineralised structure of up to 2.5m wide to be explored and the possibility of other as yet unknown structures related to the same hydrothermal fluid source and regional structures.\nThe Company continued to examine and explore the underground workings and surrounding area, locating previously unknown adits to the east of the mine.

Meanwhile, the battery pack comply with FCC and CE certified testing standards, let you use with worry free.\nSmall size generators are a good way to recover power when the energy power supply stops working. A portable generator gives crucial power back-up at these locations. It is essential to recognize how to select a portable generator because it requires comprehending some electrical terms like wattage as well as voltage.\nA portable generator is not ideal for high energy-consuming appliances like electric furnaces.An internet site that sells this kind of generator also gives electrical power calculator. A 3000-4000 watts generator is sufficient for a tiny residence that needs to run 3-4 lights, TV, fridge as well as microwave. There is no need to get a higher electrical power generator than exactly what is needed due to the fact that it will certainly take in more fuel.\nSuch generators typically give 10 hrs of continual power on a complete tank. A generator that gives maximum hrs of power using minimum amount of fuel need to be picked since the reoccuring expense of gasoline is the most significant cost included in running a generator.\nThese generators have little wheels near the bottom so it is easy to lug them anywhere. At the same time, some greater electrical power generators are hefty and also can not be transferred to an additional place by one individual. Then the weight as well as transportability of the generator ought to be checked, if the generator will certainly be used at camping or building website.\nSome portable generators are not developed to run sensitive electronic devices like computer systems. These generators generate rising and fall current that is all right for general appliances but not appropriate for tools that need constant stable power. For running delicate devices like computers, an inverter generator ought to be used.\nIn a lot of suburbs, there are strict council and also structure legislations associated to the generator sound degree. Much less noisy generator is also much less annoying for the customers. Portable generators are offered in quiet varieties also yet these systems set you back extra. These are some crucial variables to think about when acquiring this type of generator. All generators provide the very same conventional 120V and usually have a solitary electrical outlet. Circuitry is required to take power from this outlet as well as send to multiple electrical outlets.\nHow many watts do you need for a portable power generator?\nThis is certainly a really important question that most people have when they go to buy a generator. It all is determined by exactly what your requirements are for the devices that you want to operate. If the goal to obtain a power generator will be to continue to keep your refrigerator or freezer working in the event of an electrical power outage or to just power your tv or laptop then a lower wattage model might be acceptable. If you would like run a number of items simultaneously or maybe operate power tools and air conditioning systems then you definitely will want to check out an electrical generator with a higher wattage.

This study found that the level of crop water stress could be easily calculated using CWSIEE with only air and canopy temperature data.\nIn this study, we estimated soil moisture values using the Deep Neural Network(DNN) scheme at the mountainous regions. In order to test the sensitive analysis of DNN scheme, we collected the measured(at the soil depths of 10 cm and 30 cm) soil moisture and DNN input(weather and land surface) data at the Pyeongchang-gun(relatively flat) and Geochang-gun(steep slope) sites. Our findings indicated that the soil moisture estimates were sensitive to the weather variables(5 days-averaged rainfall, 5 days precedent rainfall, accumlated rainfall) and DEM. These findings showed that the DEM and weather variables play the key role in the processes of soil water flow at the mountainous regions. We estimated the soil moisture values at the soil depths of 10 cm and 30 cm using DNN at two study sites under different climate-landsurface conditions. The estimated soil moisture(R: 0.890 and RMSE: 0.041) values at the soil depth of 10 cm were comparable with the measured data in Pyeongchang-gun site while the soil moisture estimates(R: 0.843 and RMSE: 0.048) at the soil depth of 30 cm were relatively biased. The DNN-based soil moisture values(R: 0.997/0.995 and RMSE: 0.014/0.006) at the soil depth of 10 cm/30 cm matched well with the measured data in Geochang-gun site. Although uncertainties exist in the results, our findings indicated that the DNN-based soil moisture estimation scheme demonstrated the good performance in estimating soil moisture values using weather and land surface information at the monitoring sites. Our proposed scheme can be useful for efficient land surface management in various areas such as agriculture, forest hydrology, etc.\nAlthough there have been a lot of efforts to improve water quality in the estuarine reservoir, overall the water quality problems of the estuarine reservoirs remain. So, it is essential to establish water quality management plans under a comprehensive understanding of the environmental characteristics of the estuarine reservoir. Therefore, in this study, a resilience analysis framework for evaluating the estuarine reservoir\u2019s water quality was suggested for improving existing assessment method for water quality management plan. First, as a result of analyzing the static resilience to each scenario, it was found that from the S3 scenario in which dredging was conducted considerably, the resilience of about 30% more than the current estuarine reservoir system was restored. Second, as a result of analyzing the dynamic resilience, if cost and time are considered, there is no significant difference in robustness and resourcefulness, so it can be seen that the resilience of the estuarine reservoir can be efficiently improved by simply performing dredging up to the level of Scenario 3. Finally, as a result of comparing static and dynamic resilience, since static resilience is only presented as a single value, the differences and characteristics of the resilience capacity of the estuarine reservoir might be overlooked only by the static resilience analysis. However, in the aspect that it is possible to interpret the internal recovery capacity of the estuarine reservoir in multiple ways with various indicators (robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness, rapidity), evaluating water quality based on dynamic resilience analysis is useful.<|endoftext|>As with previous generations, the Gary Fong Lightsphere\u00ae Collapsible Speed Mount will continue to provide photographers with the ability to achieve studio-style lighting effects, anywhere at anytime.

In order to accomplish this, we first need to look at the challenges we face when connecting people to things.\nIn today\u2019s world, it is has become commonplace for users to use their personal devices to connect them to resources in the organisation. These devices include laptops, mobile devices, IP cameras, printers, and more.\nThe organisation faces a challenge in both allowing the end-user to connect securely and providing access to data that is secured. BYOD or Bring Your Own Device is here to stay and in order to ensure that users can actually bring their own devices and be secure, we need to look at a number of things.\nOrganisations can use the 802.1x protocol to allow users to connect their devices securely. This ensures that only authenticated users are actually allowed to connect to the corporate network. This protocol suite will determine the identity of the user or device being connected, and then according to configured policies it will place the user in the appropriate network.\nUsers who work remotely can connect to an organisation\u2019s resources using a VPN connection. In fact, even if users connect to a public internet network from home, it is encouraged that they make use of VPN software to keep their connection secure.\nOrganisations and end-users should make use of a firewall to protect their access to the internet. Firewalls protect organisations and users from malicious attackers who wish to gain access to corporate or personal endpoints/devices. The firewall is your corporate network\u2019s, or your home computer\u2019s, defense perimeter.\nMaking use of a VPN connection and a firewall isn\u2019t always enough to secure a user\u2019s access to a network. So how do we ensure that any kind of authentication over any network is done in a secure manner? Authentication involves a user sending their username and password across a public or private transport medium to a destination network where they are authenticated.\nWhen users connect to an organisation\u2019s network or to a public network, there is a risk that their user credentials might become compromised. To this end, users need to use secure passwords for their accounts which need to be at least 8 characters in length. These passwords should be a mix of alphanumeric characters and symbols. Even though a secure password is configured, this may not necessarily provide a 100% secure authentication experience.\nSo what happens when a secure password is not enough? The solution to this problem comes in the form of Multi Factor Authentication or 2FA (Two Factor Authentication). This involves a user entering a password and then performing a secondary authentication process whereby the user provides a code from an app on their mobile device, a biometric scan, or a physical security token.\nWhether you are a corporate user or just using your devices for personal use, MFA can secure access to your applications. Using your mobile device, you can, for example, download an authenticator app and use it as an additional layer of security when accessing data. But what about the actual device\u2019s security? How do we know that the device we are using is actually safe to use?\nEven though users can connect securely using various methods such as 802.1x, VPNs, MFA, etc. there is still the risk that a device might be compromised in some way. Every day people use the Internet to access various resources. People copy files from one device to another, and often do so with little regard for how safely these actions are performed. An unsuspecting user could click on a malicious link in a website and suddenly find that their device is infected with malware or a virus.\nEndpoint devices must be secured with an endpoint security product. In an organisation, these endpoints are usually centrally managed and administrators can easily identify vulnerable endpoints and take action. Sophisticated endpoint security product suites should prevent the exploitation, infection or tampering of connected devices. Once we have secured our devices, how do we protect the confidentiality of our data?\nWhen storing sensitive data on an endpoint, it is vital that we store that data securely and protect the data\u2019s confidentiality. Data encryption can be used for this purpose. Several products on the market specialise in data encryption and many operating systems often come with built-in data encryption software. External storage devices can be encrypted if the device is moved from one place to another.\nWe have seen how users can protect their endpoints in many different ways, whether this is taken care of by an organisation\u2019s administrator or by the user on their personal devices at home.\nSecure connections using protocols such as 802.1x, VPN software typically with an active firewall on the device.\nSecure authentication with strong passwords and Multi Factor Authentication.\nSecure devices using endpoint protection software suites for Anti-Virus and Antimalware.\nSecuring data on devices using data encryption software.\nMy name is Pieter du Plooy.

Funny enough, she is also fast in catching on to trends and new things. After visiting the fan\u2019s house, her mother asked about BTS and how she\u2019s seen them all over the news. The fan began to explain who the group was while her mother took out her phone and took detailed notes.\nAfter note-taking, her mother asked for some videos of the group. As soon as legendary clips of BTS came on the screen, her mother whipped out her phone and started comparing the notes to the video, trying to memorize who is who.\nThe fan took her mother\u2019s phone to take a look and this is what she found: A whole list of the member\u2019s names, ages, and traits.\nRM (Kim Nam Joon) 25 years old. In charge of English speaking. Rapper. Lyricist and producer. Charisma from Ilsan.\nJin (Kim Seok Jin) 27 years old. Worldwide handsome. Good looking oldest member. From Gyeonggido Gwacheon.

Good and singing and dancing. Has a pretty line when dancing.\nJungkook (Jeon Jungkook) 22 years old. Main vocal. Has great thighs. Golden maknae. Jack of all trades as he can sing, dance, do sports as well as shoot film. He is a bit shy but totally changes once on stage.\nHer mother spent a total of two hours studying BTS before going back home. She also confirmed that her bias was J-Hope that day as well.\nThe next day she received a text from her mom.\nMom: The mic is supposed to drop at the end of the video but why doesn\u2019t that part show?\nMom: What are the main points of \u201cDNA?\u201d Who rocks this video?\nFan: The whistle sound.

Bidding began at 1.5 billion won (US$1.23 million) each but ended with zero bids.\nGilt-bronze Standing Buddha, dating back to the middle of the 7th century during the period of Unified Silla (668-918), was designated as South Korea's Treasure No. 284 in 1963. Standing in an imposing posture, its height reaches 38 centimeters, larger than any other gilt-bronze Buddhist statue manufactured during the Silla period.\nGilt-bronze Standing Bodhisattva, which was made between the 6th and 7th centuries during the Silla period, was designated as Treasure No. 285 in 1963. The 19-cm-high statue was discovered in Geochang, southeast South Korea.\nKansong Art Museum was founded by Korean businessman Jeon Hyeong-pil (1906-1962) in 1938, initially with the name Bohwagak, during the Japanese occupation of the Korean Peninsula.\nWednesday was the first time that the Seoul-based private museum had put up part of its collection for auction. The auction plan reportedly came due to the museum's financial hardship.\nAmid concerns of overseas purchases, some cultural heritage experts have called for the National Museum of Korea (NMK) to use state coffers to buy and preserve the two treasures at home.\nNMK representatives reportedly reached out to Kansong for a private sale, but the latter insisted on holding a public auction to respect potential bidders.\nObservers predict that the Kansong museum will put the items, along with other treasures in its possession, back on auction in the near future.<|endoftext|>Hi My English is not very good, I hope you can understand.\nI use 5D Mark iv with canon 70-200 f2.8 is iii usm to photograph birds I found that 200 mm Not enough for shooting birds at all So I think I need to get a super telephoto lens for bird photography, but I had a hard time deciding with these two lens.\nIf I decide from price 120-300 definitely win, but I want to buy these high-priced lenses first time and last time But I think 120-300 will be more flexible to use but in my opinion The lens is designed to be used at 300mm.

Since 2004, more than $75 million of capital has poured into these new dairy startups pioneered by New Zealand dairy investors partnered with locals. This system is profitable and environmentally sustainable. Further growth and diffusion of this model is hampered by a shortage of skilled grazing dairy managers in the U.S. One method used extensively in New Zealand to overcome this human resource barrier is the concept of sharemilking as the first stage of a dairyman\u2019s career path. Careful alignment of interests via sharemilking contracts provides a means to overcome barriers to entry for younger and minority dairymen while overcoming management shortages for existing dairies. This proposal seeks to fund workshops and the development of a sharemilker\u2019s web-based resource featuring sample sharemilking contracts, decision tools, educational resources and case studies.<|endoftext|>For I\u2019m told I\u2019m made of you and that you are of me.\nOh Universe, I beg you, Awaken me please.\nFor K\u0101la churns forward and my locks show grays.\nOh Universe, an end to this cycle of decrepit ends is for which I obsess.\nWhy prepare me for greatness, then one day end me in a glance?\nOh Universe, you allure the ego with blandishments, keeping the secret of eternal bliss untold?\nThis mind yearns to know the unknown, where the \"I\" and the \"me\" are left unsaid.\nOh Universe, will you dissolve this self in Unity and grant Divine Insight?\nHarmonious Universe, what is the purpose of this life?\nWhen vision is clouded by Maya, and the soul's vessel ravaged by karmic strife.\nOh Universe, why is life\u2019s journey a treacherously torturous twist?\nAlluring Universe, why build lofty castles in the sky?\nWhen spring\u2019s flowers will surely wither and in autumn leaves run dry.\nOh Universe, will you show me The Path to Nirvana at last, forsooth?<|endoftext|>Nation Current Affairs 11 Jul 2019 CBI raids premises o...\nNew Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday carried out raids at the premises of notable lawyers Indira Jaising and her husband Anand Grover husband in connection with the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) violation case.\nThe searches were at the Delhi and Mumbai offices of their NGO and homes as well, the police said.

I thought the environment and students of CWNU are outstanding when I looked at it as the president of Geochang Provincial College. I ran for the election to develop CWNU more, using those conditions. So, it turned out to be a good result.\nQ. I anticipate a future of university administrations because you have lots of administrative experiences. Could you introduce to us how you will lead the school?\nChoi: I would like to lead student-centered university administrations. Making students people who are helpful to a community is important. We can overcome the present university\u2019s problems if we do this because the university is related with communities in every way. Anyway, I\u2019d like to make our school to the central university in Gyeongnam.\nQ. How would you get close to students?\nChoi: I would like to have a talk with regular students periodically more than executives. Our students are second to none but their family background is not good. For those students, I cared for a scholarship for their regular academic performances. The scholarship will be increased a little.\nQ. In these days, unemployment is a big issue not only for graduates but for other age groups. How can we get through these situations?\nChoi: I want to make people aware that CWNU has a higher employment rate by enhancing employment rate to 70% within a year. There are many enterprises around our university and I think it can solve unemployment. Among 3000 enterprises, we will sign MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) with 300 companies and one company can hire at least one person.\nQ. Many students\u2019 wish is an improvement of school cafeteria\u2019s menu quality. How would you figure out this problem?\nChoi: Students have told that lunch money is not expensive compared to other universities, but our school food quality is lower than others. I plan to resolve it within the school budget, not raising the cost. I\u2019m going to use the school cafeteria, too.\nQ. What do you think CWNU would be like after a four-year term?\nChoi: I want to see its standing as a national university from a local university. I\u2019ll try to foster the school for 4 years. Also, I like to see a growing school and will support it after my retirement.\nQ. Please leave a message to the students.\nChoi: Have a challenging spirit. Your dreams and hopes are endless. I believe it comes true as much as you set it and achieve it. However, you should increase your competitiveness and abilities at the same time because everything is made by efforts. If you can achieve it, I\u2019m sure our students will go to the world.<|endoftext|>The BEST WESTERN Hotel Rebstock, run by the same family for 3 generations, offers panoramic views of Lake Constance from the restaurant, spacious rooms with a balcony, free WiFi and free parking on site.

Today, I\u2019m absolutely GUSHING over Rachel McMillan\u2019s historical mystery and romance release, Murder at the Flamingo, with a review, interview with Rachel, BOOK RECOMMENDATIONS FROM HER, and a GIVEAWAY!\nRead on for more awesome bookish stuff!\nHamish DeLuca has spent most of his life trying to hide the anxiety that appears at the most inopportune times \u2014 including during his first real court case as a new lawyer. Determined to rise above his father\u2019s expectations, Hamish runs away to Boston where his cousin, Luca Valari, is opening a fashionable nightclub in Scollay Square. When he meets his cousin\u2019s \u201cright hand man\u201d Reggie, Hamish wonders if his dreams for a more normal life might be at hand.\nRegina \u201cReggie\u201d Van Buren, heir to a New Haven fortune, has fled fine china, small talk, and the man her parents expect her to marry. Determined to make a life as the self-sufficient city girl she\u2019s seen in her favorite Jean Arthur and Katharine Hepburn pictures, Reggie runs away to Boston, where she finds an easy secretarial job with the suave Luca Valari. But as she and Hamish work together in Luca\u2019s glittering world, they discover a darker side to the smashing Flamingo night club.\nWith Rachel McMillan\u2019s distinct historical voice and attention to detail, she paints a vivid historical mystery with a hint of romance against the backdrop of a brilliant 1930s Boston scene. In her distinct way, she makes the setting a secondary character of its own, vocal and important in its culture and story role. With a fabulous puzzle solved and room for more adventures to come, the city comes to life as the characters grapple with loyalty, independence, anxiety, and purpose.\nHamish and Reggie are endearing, quirky, enigmatic, and just plain lovable. Even secondary characters like Luca (whom you will dislike/love/want to hug all at once!) and Nate (and his wonderful candidness!) are sure to be favorites and promise to be even more essential in stories to come. And I just want to hang out with Reggie and watch films of the time!\nFans of McMillan\u2019s previous Herringford & Watts series will be ecstatic to learn of the \u201cnext\u201d generation (Hamish is a DeLuca, after all) and see tiny nods to the previous series and a familiar name or two!\nLet\u2019s stop right here and talk about Hamish. He is SUCH a product of his parents! But, he is his own kind of special, quirky, and important. Through his unique viewpoint, Rachel McMillan illustrates the challenges of mental illness \u2014 namely anxiety and panic \u2014 in a normalizing and emphatic way. This makes him wonderfully relatable \u2014 even for a reader with no personal experience with such challenges (like myself). I applaud her for using characterization to subtly bring awareness and empathy to the forefront in a way that adds so much to the story.\nI could talk all day about more wonderful elements of this story \u2014 lemon cannolis, bicycles, jazz, picture shows, DANCES, light bulbs, classic literature, and an implied message of grace. Instead, I hope you choose to discover for yourself all the intricacies and fun of this little mystery.\nI cannot wait to see where these beloved characters will take me next!\nMANY thanks to Thomas Nelson for the review copy.\nPick one: lemon sandwich or lemon cannoli?\nAHHH this is so hard. I am going to say cannoli.\nWhat\u2019s next for this set of characters?\nMurder in the City of Liberty releases next May and it finds Hamish and Reggie two years after they open Van Buren and DeLuca investigations/legal consulting/Winchester Molloy listening, in 1940. There are two major forces in this book: the first is a black baseball player and fastest base stealer in the Boston farm leagues who becomes the target of a series of horrible pranks that eventually lead to murder. The second is a growing racism (specifically anti-Semitism) which aligns with the conflict in Europe (for which Hamish\u2019s home country is already fighting). Very much like The White Feather Murders, I wanted explore the lack of social justice and the rampant prejudice heightened during war time. On a personal front, Reggie and Hamish are doing a very poor job of being \u201cjust friends.\u201d And Nate gets a little bit of romance of his own!\nMurder at the Flamingo incorporates a character with panic and anxiety when mental illness was taboo for the era. And, you have started a related hashtag #FictionForEmpowerment. Tell us more about that!\nYes! It is something that I have lived with my entire life and I thought this was the perfect time to talk about it through a fictional lens: so all of the symptoms and challenges I ascribe to Hamish are things I have struggled with since childhood. Mental illness is very much like any other illness \u2014except it is invisible. So while, not unlike someone with cancer or diabetes, I have to see a doctor regularly and use medicinal treatment to live a full life, it is not something that is completely easy for everyone to understand. In Hamish DeLuca\u2019s time, there were still rather primitive ideas about it and studies that found patients being doled all manner of horrible mercury pills (that ravaged the system), being locked in sanitariums or exposed to shock treatment. Because of Hamish\u2019s visible symptoms, these are things that are very real threat to him. I wanted to show that a character who suffers from this illness still has adventures and tries to get the girl: even though he had a steeper hill to climb in terms of acceptance than we do nowadays, he still is just a human being. At heart, this series works to normalize mental illness without hopefully ever being slated as \u201cissue\u201d fiction. (For Herringford and Watts readers of The White Feather Murders, you will recognize that Hamish comes by his right hand tremor genetically. Something his father had since the end of A Lesson in Love and Murder).\nI loved writing all of them. Just like in Herringford and Watts: they all mean so much to me. I gave Reggie all my qu"

Any disorder can put a decent amount of stress and on any human being, this does not mean that shutting that person out of your life forever will help solve the problem; because it will simple not help anyone. What any person should do in a situation that has a loved one with a disorder like this would be to first identify one hundred percent that the person truly has the symptoms and signs of the disorder. Then seek medical help and learn as much information as one can possibly do. Even if there is a treatment, but it will not cure the person completely it will benefit everyone in the long run because it will make life simpler and it will not put so much stress on loved ones and they can lead a happy, fulfilling life. A documentary on the Oprah Winfrey Show that can also be found on YouTube of a girl with schizophrenia named January \u201cJani\u201d Schofield was diagnosed with this disorder at the age of six years old in 2009. Since Jani was showing the signs of schizophrenia they had to take her out of school when she was in the first grade. Because Jani did not have the right social skill to be around other children and then at times Jani would be too much of a handful for her teachers and they would spend more attention and energy on her and not the other students. Slowly, her parents put her back in to the school system, but it was not with other children and she did not go...... middle of paper......t mean the hallucinations will go away for good, it will simply control the delusions and hallucinations. If a schizophrenic is unable to take medication or chooses not to take it, there is another option. They can do, it is called a cognitive behavioral therapy. \u201cReporting Feb. 6 in The Lancet, British researchers say that the treatment can help ease patients' psychotic symptoms and boost their personal and social functioning\u201d (Robert Preidt February 2014). For a schizophrenic to go to therapy will help them accomplish everyday tasks such as, cooking, cleaning, and everyday grooming. Therapy will also encourage the patient to have weekly goals they can accomplish or working on their social skills with their friends and family and even people they work with. Giving them limits of what they can do so they do not feel so overwhelmed with everyday tasks can also help.<|endoftext|>Warning: The video contains graphic language.\nCharges will not be filed against a driver who was filmed driving through a group of Black Lives Matter demonstrators as they blocked lanes of traffic in Ventura earlier this month, prosecutors said Thursday.\nThe incident took place as protesters gathered at the intersection of Victoria Avenue and Telephone Road on June 7, according to a Ventura County District Attorney\u2019s Office news release.\nDuring the protest, a number of people went in the street, blocking two lanes of traffic and obstructing some vehicles, prosecutors said.\n\u201cTraffic continued to proceed through the intersection, and ultimately a low speed collision occurred between a white pick-up truck and two protestors standing in the roadway on northbound Victoria Avenue,\u201d the release stated.\nThe motorist drove away from the scene but contacted police and alerted them to the incident soon after, authorities said.\nWitnesses captured the events that transpired before, during and after the collision on video, and authorities used that, along with footage from traffic cameras in the area, in deciding there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to charge the driver, according to the DA\u2019s office.\nProsecutors said the motorist was acting in self-defense, noting that he had proceeded \u201cslowly and reasonably\u201d while the protesters were violating the California Vehicle Code.\nVideo of the incident showed the motorist slowing down as he encountered a group of demonstrators who were gathered in street and tried to motion them away with his hand.\nIn turn, they surrounded the pickup, which was moving slowly but did not stop as two people were in front of the vehicle, and began hitting it, according to the footage.\nOne of the demonstrators who was in physical contact with the front of the vehicle was pushed down to the ground as a result, according to prosecutors, citing the footage. He could be seen getting up and, along with several others, attempting to run after the truck as it sped off.\nA second protestor\u2019s foot was hit while she tried to move out of the way.\nOne suffered a broken ankle while the other was uninjured, according to authorities.\nThe incident happened amid a Black Lives Matter demonstration that began at the nearby Ventura County Government Center and drew about 1,500 people, the Ventura County Star reported.<|endoftext|>Particular the red flowers lit up with its color this time of year.

If you\u2019re curious (or even skeptical) about the effectiveness of affirmations, I invite you to read on to see how positive affirmations can impact your life for the better.\nIf you take a moment to think about all of the places your mind goes to in a day, you\u2019ll realize that there are both positive and negative things that you think (and speak) about. This means that affirmations can be either positive or negative. As we move through our lives, we develop thought processes that turn into belief systems. If we think of affirmations as being the same as thoughts, negative affirmations turn into negative belief systems, which can impact the way we perceive ourselves and our places in the world. For example, by repeatedly thinking, \u201cI\u2019m not good at writing,\u201d you ingrain in yourself the belief that you are not (and will never be) good at writing. In doing so, you cut yourself off from opportunities because you\u2019ve decided (through your self-talk) that you aren\u2019t good at it, and you might lose all hope of getting better. Many people suffer from these negative thought patterns that lead them into a downward spiral and block them from reaching their goals or enjoying their lives. One way to counteract these negative beliefs is by consciously changing the way we think. A concrete and effective way of doing this is by thinking and saying positive affirmations.\nPositive affirmations are a powerful way to stop negative thought patterns. When you think or speak a positive affirmation, it signals your subconscious mind that you are making a change and beginning to think about yourself and your life in a different way. Just like any process of change, it takes time and practice for these affirmations to sink in and \u201cstick\u201d as part of your thought pattern.\nThe effectiveness of positive affirmations in certain situations is backed up by science. A study recently published in Psychological Science explores the neurophysiological reactions that help explain how positive affirmations help people deal with threats to self-integrity. Another study by researchers from Carnegie Mellon University (published in PLOS ONE) determined that positive affirmations protect individuals against the negative effects of stress on problem-solving abilities. In addition to scientific research, there is a large body of anecdotal evidence that people feel more optimistic about certain aspects of their lives when they use positive affirmations.\nHow do I increase the effectiveness of my positive affirmations?\nThere are several things you can do to increase the effectiveness of positive affirmations. Saying the affirmations out loud gives them weight and signals your subconscious mind to take them seriously. To increase the effectiveness of positive affirmations, make a conscious decision to think positive thoughts throughout the day. Challenging yourself to find one positive thing about each situation also helps. At the end of your day, review everything you did, your conversations with people, your reactions, etc., and think of at least one positive thing that came out of it. These positive thoughts will \u201cprime\u201d your mind to accept the positive affirmations, thus making them more effective. When you dedicate yourself to this process, before long, you\u2019ll notice that you feel better and that you are able to approach life in a more positive and productive way.\nWhat are some examples of positive affirmations to try?\nThe great thing about positive affirmations is that they can be tailored to your specific goals or general in nature. Here are some general affirmations you can try.\nI listen to my inner wisdom.\nWonderful"

The darkly ambient pop group, led by singer-songwriter Greg Gonzalez, has been gaining traction since their self-titled debut in 2017, and when you combine that sound with an on-brand, highly personable social media presence, you\u2019ve got yourself a buzz-worthy band that has staying power in today\u2019s world of fleeting indie successes. For their follow-up, CRY, the group voyaged to the Spanish Island of Mallorca to record the nine tracks, and it\u2019s a vibe\u2014at this point, if Cigarettes After Sex has one thing going for them, it\u2019s vibes. Oh god, I can\u2019t believe I actually just typed that.\nIn fact, many comparisons can be made between the two albums. And it goes far beyond the phenomena of some insufferable hipster groaning \u201cAll of their songs sound the sameeee,\u201d complete with a five-minute eye-roll. The truth is, the two albums sound remarkably similar. Those who have committed their entire discography to memory (re: me) should be able to distinguish which track belongs to which album, but even then, it\u2019s hard. I actually have to give credit to Gonzalez for being able to keep track of all these songs that sound the same. If Cigarettes After Sex has introduced a new color to their world of charcoal and ash, its a barely discernible taupe. But the dilemma? It still sounds so good. Sonically, CRY is painting with 50 shades of grey.\nNow for the bad news: Lyrically, CRY is painting with FIFTY SHADES OF GREY.\nIn a piece for Talkhouse, legendary French singer Francoise Hardy gushed over the band\u2019s sound, sharing that it was the music \u201cwhich I have been looking for all my life.\u201d However, she also revealed that she didn\u2019t understand the lyrics because she\u2019s not fluent in English, although she was \u201csure they are as inspired as the rest of the band\u2019s sound.\u201d The problem is: they\u2019re not. If one was to unlearn the English language and simply hear Gonzalez\u2019s dulcet vocals as a series of languid vowels, then what we have here is a gorgeous collection of melodies that few can criticize. But at times, the lyrics on CRY can really mess with\u2014you guessed it\u2014the album\u2019s vibe.\n\u201cKiss It Off Me\u201d is perhaps the worst offender: \u201cSaw you on the side of the road / I could see you walking slow, drinkin\u2019 a Slurpee / In\u2005a\u2005peach baseball cap, fallin\u2019\u2005in my lap / You were so thirsty.\u201d And then, as if things couldn\u2019t get any more awkward, Gonzalez follows up with \u201cKnow I make you forget / About all of those rich fuckboys.\u201d The lyrics break the gorgeous illusion the music creates, which seems to lend itself to more sophisticated subject matter. Another instance is \u201cHentai,\u201d in which Gonzalez regales a time when he told his lover about a hentai video he watched right before they had sex for the first time\u2026 For those of you not familiar with the term, it\u2019s anime porn, and while he never mentions it again, it makes you feel slimy for the rest of the song. Maybe even the rest of the day.\nPerhaps that\u2019s the entire point, the silly secret behind the group\u2019s virility and memorability. The lyrics of CRY, at best sickeningly sweet and at worst downright cringe-worthy, form an impression in a way that most indie guitar pop bands don\u2019t. Can you name a Beach Fossils lyric right off the top of your head? How about Real Estate? Wild Nothing? For better or for worse, Cigarettes After Sex\u2019s lyrics are easy to grasp onto, to get stuck in your head as you complete life\u2019s mundane activities.\nCRY shows no signs of evolution for Cigarettes After Sex, but then again, it never promised any. All it promises is a passionate one-night stand, a single evening on a stormy beach. A step into a monochromatic universe where rain isn\u2019t just rain, but the sky\u2019s lovelorn tears.<|endoftext|>NOTE: Conservation Sudbury is monitoring the guidance pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Most college football programs would love to be in that position.\nI\u2019m going to start with the good, but not going to dwell there because everyone already has hashed out exactly what they\u2019ve done.\nI\u2019m a big fan of \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d One scene in the last season reminds me of this Iowa State team. Without any spoilers, Rick and the gang are in a scuffle with a guy named Negan and his group of ruffians. At one point, Negan has Rick and his son, Carl, absolutely dead to rights with literally no visible or conceivable means of escape.\nKneeling and bound, Rick looks at this guy and says, \u201cI don\u2019t know how and I don\u2019t know when, but I will kill you.\u201d He had no reason to believe that he was going to win \u2014 or even survive, for that matter. But he had all the confidence in the world.\nThat is this Iowa State group (minus the zombies and people trying to murder you).\nNo matter what situation they find themselves in \u2014 throwing an interception and facing essentially first and goal with a one-score lead \u2014 they have no fear that they will be stuck in it.\nFollowing the Texas game, Iowa State coach Matt Campbell spoke to the media about needing to get more consistency from play to play across the board. They\u2019ve gotten that in spades. That\u2019s the strength of this team. They will never quit.\nThat patience, poise and confidence are exactly what gets other teams in trouble when they play Iowa State. The defense plays such a way that your underneath routes are available, but every play will be a checkdown and tackle. Every team ISU has played since employing this aggressively passive defense hasn\u2019t been able to stare eye-to-eye for the length of the game without getting greedy and falling flat.\nGenerally speaking, this unit is one of the best fitting and tackling units in the country. It\u2019s their soundness that makes them so good. Against TCU, Iowa State lost that soundness at times. Specifically, run plays that attacked the C-gap (between the tackle and tight end) were successful against the Cyclones' defense. These were the plays in the fourth quarter on their multiple drives that they got down in scoring position.\nIowa State lines up their defensive ends (when they\u2019re in their three-down front) on the inside shoulder of the offensive tackle. It may not seem like much, but when the gap TCU wants to exploit is outside of that man, it\u2019s an easier leverage point to get the end cut off, making the person responsible for that gap either an outside linebacker or safety. TCU did a good job at getting that person blocked as well, which left a lot of space for the ball-carrier to run through. Once they were in space, the tackling of the secondary was less stellar than it has been in weeks past. Other teams will notice this same deficiency, so getting that fixed will be an important step before the Mountaineers and Cowboys start rolling.\nI can say with full confidence that this is the best Cyclone team since the Dan McCarney era (including every team that I was on). The ceiling is the limit. Let\u2019s not let anything \u2014 Kirk Herbstreit tweets, top-25 rankings, ESPN's College GameDay or no GameDay, weather or rumors about college programs trying to hire away Campbell \u2014 take away from appreciating this group.\nThe Cyclones are in first place in the Big 12.\nJeff Woody is a former Iowa State football player and writes weekly Cyclones football analysis for Cyclone Insider during the season.<|endoftext|>How to Memorize Han Hwondang Kim Goengpil(\u5bd2\u6684\u5802 \u91d1\u5b8f\u5f3c) and Do-dong Seowon(\u9053\u6771\u66f8\u9662): Focusing on Chinese Poems Collected in Anthologies\n\nThis paper was written to examine descendents\u2019 views and memories on Han Hwondang Kim Goengpil and Do-dong Seowon in Hyeonpung, Daegu, which has enshrined him, by referencing to others\u2019 Chinese poems collected in anthologies. There remains no Kim Goengpil\u2019s anthologies, so only Gyeonghyeonrok(\u666f\u8ce2\u9304) may seem to be selected as a reference for him, but there are, however, few writings of him, and therefore, it is difficult to investigate his scholarly career and guarantee the objectivity of the contents collected in them, as there are a lot of literature regarding the post-evaluation for Chujeung(\u8ffd\u8d08) and Gajeung(\u52a0\u8d08). Hence, the Chinese poems collected in others\u2019 anthologies were examined to show that the birth and death dates of authors from the contemporary figures who directly interacted with Kim Goengpil to Myeon-u Gwak Jongseok who lived in the 20th century are evenly distributed, and that the subjects of Chinese poems recited primarily include the text of \u2018Sohak(\u5c0f\u5b78)\u2019 on which he concentrated his efforts for a life; Hapcheon and Geochang, in which he often stayed when he was young; Huicheon and Suncheon, in which he stayed twice due to Sahwa(\u53f2\u798d); and Hyeonpung in which Do-dong Seowon is placed. Main places recited in the Chinese poems include Sohakdang(\u5c0f\u5b78\u5802) and Jidongam(\u5fd7\u540c\u5dd6), the spaces used for the lectures conducted together with Jeong Yeochang in Hapcheon; Supodae(\u6c34\u7011\u81fa) in which he strolled about together with his sister\u2019s husbands, Choi Sukryang and Jeong Yeochang and Mohyeongjeong(\u6155\u8ce2\u4ead) which Choi Sukryang\u2019s decendents constructed to celebrate the meeting of them in Geochang; and the site in which an old house is located and Do-dong Seowon in Hyeonpung. In the process, the contemporary poetry and prose about Kim Goengpil were created by concentrating on grief and reverence for him who suffered from political vicissitudes, but shifted the authors\u2019 focus to the space of Do-dong Seowon, generation after generation, probably implying that the descendents regard Kim Goengpil as a past figure, but view Do-dong Seowon as an existent space before their eyes. Although the title board for Do-dong Seonwon was bestowed in the first half of the 17th century, Jeyeongsi(\u984c\u8a60\u8a69) about it primarily consist of works created by literary men who lived in the 18th-19th century, which may be associated with the situation in which the contemporary intellectuals suffered from serious chaos caused by foreign countries\u2019 reckless invasion. Do-dong Seowon was memorized by intellectuals who faced the modern transition period, not only as the space for reverence for Kim Goeingpil and for junior scholars\u2019 lectures. The intellectuals, who might be more concerned about the role of Confucianism than ever, thus attempted to memorize Do-dong Seowon as the space for wishing the recovery of the national destiny, the revival of Confucianism and the succession of Confucian philosophy.<|endoftext|>Can't find a pic. The first, guitar bridge construction type is the fixed bridge, whilst the second type is floating bridge type (also known to be the tremolo bridges). When purchasing the floating bridge guitar, the most important factor that you have to consider is the budget. Also, since the construction needs to be a little more detailed, you might want to look into defects especially around the bridge area. Sign up Log in. A real floating bridge. ultimate guitar com. Gonna try to find a pic of that thing. So, before I even consider doing any intonation work, I fully set up the guitar. Some guitar players prefer a floating bridge, as it allows them to manipulate the whammy bar in both directions instead of only forward. In this case, I leveled all the frets, setup, and intonated this Epiphone Joe Pass hollowbody before I started securing the floating bridge. Gregg Allman - Floating Bridge Low Country Blues (2011) Original in B, so when played in A: Capo 2 --- / [Intro] A A A A / [Verse 1] A A A A Well, I never will forget that floatin' bridge D. A major cause of the floating tremolo's increasingly poor reputation since its introduction is the far-increased availability and popularity of lighter guitar strings, which do not produce enough tension in standard tuning to compensate for the low break-angle over the bridge and, in the Jaguar's case, the exceptionally short scale length of 24 inches. However, their construction fits into two anatomies. It\u2019s important to note that if your guitar isn\u2019t properly set up, trying to set the intonation is pointless. The Two Guitar Bridge Types (Fixed Bridge & Floating Bridge) There are many different types of guitar bridges out there. A floating bridge is a term that refers to a guitar bridge that is raised up and not flush against the body of the guitar."

I know that |usl because the plan produces positive results in the past, this does not guarantee success in the future.

Although the original course is dated June 1933. the actual alterations were handwritten in early 1955. So I can presume that Gann thought it was important enough to insert and sign it before he sent the course to Mr. Rondinone And what did Gann write?

Many call them \u201cThe Sound of the Apocalypse\u201d. Information about that comes from all over the world: US, UK, Costa Rica, Russia, Czech Republic, Australia, etc.\nWe have analyzed records of these sounds and found that most of their spectrum lies within the infrasound range, i.e. is not audible to humans. What people hear is only a small fraction of the actual power of these sounds.\nThey are low-frequency acoustic emissions in the range between 20 and 100 Hz modulated by ultra-low infrasonic waves from 0.1 to 15 Hz. In geophysics, they are called acoustic-gravity waves; they are formed in the upper atmosphere, at the atmosphere-ionosphere boundary in particular.\nThere can be quite a lot of causes why those waves are generated: earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, storms, tsunamis, etc. However, the scale of the observed humming sound in terms of both the area covered and its power far exceeds those that can be generated by the above-mentioned phenomena.\nIn our opinion, the source of such powerful and immense manifestation of acoustic-gravity waves must be very large-scale energy processes. These processes include powerful solar flares and huge energy flows generated by them, rushing towards Earth\u2019s surface and destabilizing the magnetosphere, ionosphere and upper atmosphere. Thus, the effects of powerful solar flares: the impact of shock waves in the solar wind, streams of corpuscles and bursts of electromagnetic radiation are the main causes of generation of acoustic-gravitation waves following increased solar activity.\nGiven the surge in solar activity as manifested itself in the higher number and energy of solar flares since mid-2011, we can assume that there is a high probability of impact of the substantial increase in solar activity on the generation of the unusual humming coming from the sky. It should be pointed out that influential scientific institutions in 2010 and 2011.\nMeanwhile, the observed increase in solar activity is fully consistent with the forecast of the International Committee GEOCHANGE published in the Committee\u2019s Report in June 2010. If this growth rate of solar activity continues, its amplitude by the end of 2012 will be higher than the amplitude of 23rd solar cycle, and in 2013-2014 the solar activity will reach its peak the amplitude of which was predicted by us to be 1.5 \u2013 1.7 times higher than the amplitude of the 23rd cycle.\nBut you said that the cause of the \u201csky hum\u201d can lie within Earth\u2019s core as well, what does it mean?\nThere is one more possible cause of these sounds and it may lie at the Earth\u2019s core. The fact is that the acceleration of the drift of the Earth\u2019s north magnetic pole which increased more than fivefold between 1998 and 2003 and is at the same level today points to intensification of energy processes in the Earth\u2019s core, since it is processes in the inner and outer core that form the Earth\u2019s geomagnetic field.\nMeanwhile, as we have already reported, on November 15, 2011 all ATROPATENA geophysical stations which record three-dimensional variations of the Earth\u2019s gravitational field almost simultaneously registered a powerful gravitational impulse. The stations are deployed in Istanbul, Kiev, Baku, Islamabad and Yogyakarta, with the first and last one being separated by a distance of about 10,000 km.\nSuch a phenomenon is only possible if the source of this emanation is at the Earth\u2019s core level. That huge energy release from the Earth\u2019s core at the end of the last year was some kind of a start signal indicating the transition of the Earth\u2019s internal energy into a new active phase.\nIntensification of the energy processes in the Earth\u2019s core can modulate the geomagnetic field which, through a chain of physical processes at the ionosphere \u2013 atmosphere boundary level, generates acoustic-gravity waves the audible range of which has been heard by people in the form of a frightening low-frequency sound in different parts of our planet.\nIn both cases, even though the causes of acoustic-gravity waves are of a quite understandable geophysical nature, they are indicative of the expected significant increase in solar activity and the geodynamic activity of our planet.\nThere is no doubt that processes in the core rule the internal energy of our planet, therefore, we should expect by the end of 2012 a sharp rise in strong earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis and extreme weather events with peak levels in 2013 \u2013 2014.<|endoftext|>What does it meaning overhead in the dream?\nIf you dreamed of using an overhead projector to give a presentation, you will experience a pleasant change in your life - possibly an improved status in your social position.<|endoftext|>20 Fudgey AIO Newborn Pocket Cloth Nappies shells to start your newborn cloth nappy journey.\nOur Fudgey 3'n'1 ORIGINALS have three layers of sewn in absobency allowing for use as an AIO.

Studies), better known as Sunday Brunch, who made her debut with an album called 200km/h. Once a legendary singer of Sonagi, a main band dongahree in Yonsei Univ., she also performed in Akaraka in 2008. Although she decided to be a singer despite her major and university education, she is happy now to be doing what she wants. The Yonsei Annals interviewed her as a role model for Yonseians who are having trouble finding their own dream, under the pressure of society.\nWhat influenced you to become a singer?\nEver since I was young, I liked music much more than others of my age. This is probably because, as my father was an audio collector, I had lots of chances to listen to music. Plus, I was a member of a band at Geochang High School when I was a student, which was very liberal and unsystematic. Actually, until then, I had no talent but just passion and interest in music. However, I could sing as much as I wanted after classes thanks to the free atmosphere, so I did not study much but enjoyed singing. I think that was when I made up my mind to become a singer.\nWhy did you choose Yonsei and your major?\nWhen I talked with my parents about my future, my father persuaded me that he would not stop me from becoming a singer if I went to a university of high academic reputation. So since senior year of high school, I started studying hard in order to achieve my dream. Regarding my major, I wanted something that had nothing to do with mathematics, as I was not that good at it. Also, I wanted to think in various perspectives open-mindedly, and thought that I would be able to learn this through political science. Yet, I did not have interest in academic learning, since I sincerely felt that it was not my thing.\nWhat were your special experiences as a lead singer, or a student?\nDuring my college days, life itself was special. I had put all my passion into and led an active life in Sonagi since I was a freshman. At first, I was stressed from the fact that I had to perform in front of people, feeling oppressed by all the people in the audience. Yet, as the days passed, I gained more confidence, and was finally able to win the top prize in MBC University Song Festival. I had even received proposals from agencies. Due to such accumulated experiences, I did not feel that exceptional even after releasing my first album since it seemed like a continuation of my dongahree life.\nApart from Songai, there was nothing special about college since I did not really know the students in my department. Once, however, I had a chance to participate in Political Science Camp without knowing any of the other students there. Luckily, I really had a great time with many people and professors. I thought professors would not like me because due to heavy band practice, I did not study hard. Surprisingly, contrary to my anxieties, they really enjoyed my singing, and I became close with them. I keep in touch with some of the professors even until now.\nWhen I was a high school student, I was not yet sure to promise that I would become a singer. After entering university, however, I had many opportunities to become a singer, such as offers from agencies. I also got envious looks from those around me, and all of these made me lighthearted. Yet, all this excitement brought a confusion, and due to personal reasons, I gave up my dream at that time.\nAlthough I abandoned my attempt to become a singer, I had a lingering affection for it. I had the belief that when choosing my job, I should be fond of and be good at it, and that it should be acknowledged by people. Only after this period did I realize that my dream met all these requirements. I started to reconsider my future deeply, and decided to challenge myself to become a singer again. However, it was just a start. After contracting with the agency and setting my foot in the entertainment field, I noticed that the atmosphere was quite different from what I was familiar with. Oftentimes, people and the things around seemed absurd and irrational as a result, and naturally, I felt excluded from these people and suffered hardships. This is when I learned how different the reality is from the ideal.\nAptitude versus academic background, what would you recommend?\nI cannot simply say which is better since I myself was also in agony choosing my path before. I think it is up to each individual to decide what is more important to him or her, following one\u2019s dreams or doing what society wants. Everyone is different, and I cannot devalue external factors such as the demands of family or social recognition. Perhaps students who attend prestigious universities, the so-called SKY, are more burdened with external factors when determining their future. If I had not gotten any prizes in contests and if people had not acknowledged my ability, I am not sure if I would have continued to try to become a singer. As the choice lies with each individual\u2019s priorities, I cannot say which is right. At least for me, my own desire was more important than other elements, which is why I ultimately chose this path.\nWhile I studied politics in detail, I felt that it was just theory for the sake of theory. It seemed that I could not change the world with these vain theories. However, music is different. Music can affect people in various ways, such as changing their thoughts by conveying diverse messages through disparate genres, melodies or lyrics. Music is what fascinates my life.\nWhile preparing my first album, I did not take much part in the recording production progress; all I did was to coat the songs with my voice. All the melodies and lyrics were provided by the agency, and were not of my own creation, so I even felt that they were not my songs. Currently, I am preparing my next album, and trying to write down the lyrics on my own, expressing what I want to say. Also, since the genre of my previous album was modern rock which is unfamiliar to most people, I will add popular pop sound to appeal more to the public.\nFirst of all, I would appreciate it very much if you would give me lots of love. (laughs) I often wander around Yonsei Univ. and see many students tired out from having to study so tremendously much. I feel sorry for them, trapped in their choking routines. However, I do not want to tell them to do what they simply like when deciding on their future, since it each individual must make their own decision. I advise Yonseians to ask themselves seriously what is more important for them. I hope they listen to their heart thoroughly, and make a decision that they will not regret.<|endoftext|>luxurious design and state-of-the-art technology.\nThe advanced technology that you would come to expect from a Hyundai has further been improved in the Elantra, which comes optional with a SatNav and touchscreen infotainment system complete with Bluetooth connectivity and USB ports.\nThe Elantra\u2019s spacious interior, leather seats and cruise control will not only impress, but also ensure the most leisurely and luxurious ride for you and your passengers.

A recent phylogenetic study based on extensive sampling revealed that S. renifolius in Korea, now described as S. koreanus, is more closely related to S. nipponicus in Korea and Japan than it is to S. renifolius in Japan and the Russian Far East (Lee et al., 2019).\nMorphologically, S. koreanus is most similar to S. renifolius in Japan, including in life history traits, perhaps sharing their most recent common ancestor. However, S. koreanus has a much smaller and more spherical spadix with fewer, smaller flowers than S. renifolius (Tables 1, 2). The average spadix length of S. koreanus is 12 mm, while that of S. renifolius is 22 mm. In addition, the average spadix width of S. koreanus is 10 mm, whereas that of S. renifolius is 15 mm. The ratio between spadix length (L) and width (W) is also different: 1.2 and 1.4 for S. koreanus and S. renifolius, respectively. Lastly, S. koreanus has many fewer flowers per spadix than S. renifolius: average of 40 versus 79. Thus, the spadix of S. koreanus in its size, shape and flower number is more similar to the spadix of S. nipponicus than to S. renifolius.\nComparison of major features of Symplocarpus koreanus and related species in eastern Asia.\nWe utilized flow cytometry to estimate ploidy level between S. koreanus and S. renifolius (see comprehensive review and references in Kron et al., 2007). Briefly, young, fresh leaf samples were analyzed on BD FACSAria Fusion Sorter System (BD Biosciences Ltd., Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) in the Cooperative Center for Research Facilities in the School of Medicine at Sungkyunkwan University. We followed the general procedures described in Dole\u017eel et al. (2007); each analysis was repeated three times. It was previously determined that three previously sampled populations of S. koreanus (Geumbyeong, Samak, and Ungil mountains) were diploid (Lee et al., 2019). Flow cytometry in this study confirmed that the genome of S. koreanus was diploid when compared to the tetraploid genome of S. renifolius in Japan (Fig. 2). Two additional populations of S. koreanus (Gangwon-do, Yonghwasan Mt. and Gyeonggi-do, Chungryungsan Mt.) had 2C (pg.) average values of 4.63 and 3.99, respectively. In contrast, the 2C value of S. renifolius had an average value of 7.08 for a population in Ibaragi Prefecture and 6.96 for a population in Iwate Prefecture. The flow cytometry results showed twice the 2C value in S. koreanus, suggesting a different ploidy level, as previously determined using karyotyping (Iwatsubo and Otsuka, 2005; Lee et al., 2019).\n1.

The tunnel stretched for some 200 meters, with 40 meters inside Israeli territory, near the northern town of Metula.\nEisenkot said the operation, dubbed \"Northern Shield,\" might take several weeks. He said that it aims to uncover and thwart all cross-border tunnels along the border between Lebanon and Israel.\nNetanyahu said the Israeli cabinet made the decision to operate against the tunnels \"weeks ago\" and moved into action on Tuesday morning.\nIsrael and Hezbollah fought a month-long war in 2006 that ended with a ceasefire.<|endoftext|>Yeah but a principle of filmmaking, tv or movie, is show don\u2019t tell.

In more ways than one.\nHe wrote a column about the sorry state of the NBA's Eastern Conference--calling it the worst conference in sports history (and with the 5-11 Knicks one game out of a playoff spot, he's probably right).\nNow, let me be clear about this. I love Bill Simmons. Yes, I think his act has gotten a little bit tired over the years. I don't laugh nearly as often as I did back about 4 years ago, since a fair portion of it is the same material rehashed over again. But when the guy is on, there's still no one better. And I check ESPN.com every day to see if he's written something new. The Mailbags, chat transcripts and the NFL Picks alone are worth it.\nThere's also not a lot of things that I like more than when he cracks on how dumb NBA teams can be. I'm not blown away by his general sports knowledge, but he definitely knows his stuff when it comes to the NBA. So I love columns like this.\nThere were some great lines in there, and I had a great 15 minutes reading it. Until I got toward the end and he started cracking on Joe Dumars again.\nWorst-case scenario: They lose in the second round, Billups leaves after the season, Melo wins the MVP and Pistons fans still refuse to admit that Joe Dumars screwed this entire decade up for them.\nEarlier in the column, he recapped some of the things that Dumars has done \"wrong\": \"Now here's the team that should be kicking itself, between passing on Melo and Bosh, giving away Arroyo and Darko, screwing up the Wallace situation and everything else.\"\nFirst let's address the Darko pick. He's harped on it for years. Yes, Anthony, Bosh, and Wade are better players than Darko. Yes, we passed on 3 of the top 15 players in the NBA for Darko. That being said: It's unfair to kill Dumars for that move. The fact of the matter is that no GM in the entire league would have taken Bosh or Wade over Darko, and pretty much everything I read indicated that there were only a few that preferred Anthony. In addition, I'm positive I heard reports leading up to the draft that some GMs liked Milicic more than LeBron. Dumars didn't screw up more than any other GM in that situation would have. Also, we needed another big man at the time because, remember, we didn't have Rasheed Wallace at that point. And Tayshaun Prince just had his breakout playoff, so we really didn't need a small forward.\nNot to mention the possibility (which is a fairly likely one, in my opinion) that Anthony wouldn't have gotten along with Larry Brown, since he didn't play defense and all. Which was kind of important on that team.\nSo was Darko a great pick? No. Does it look awful in hindsight? Absolutely. Would 80% (at least) of the GM's in the league have made the same mistake? Yup.\nAs for Darko and Arroyo: It's very questionable if this team a whole lot better with them here. And we got a first round pick in one of the deepest drafts ever (and some cap space) for them.\nOnto the Ben Wallace situation. It seems awful funny to me to kill Dumars for \"screwing up the Wallace situation\" when earlier in the exact same column, Simmons wrote that: \"It might have been a mistake to hand out $60 million to a past-his-prime, mercurial, 34-year-old rebounder/defender who can't score, hadn't been an impact player since the defensive rules changed and had just about no chance of getting along with a control freak like Scott Skiles\".\nIt's one or the other.  Because it seems to me, that if he's past his prime, he can't score, and he's not an impact player defensively, that maybe Dumars didn't screw us by letting Wallace go. He just refused to overpay and get locked into one of those bad contracts. Keep in mind that Wallace didn't like Flip Saunders at all.\nShort-term, it absolutely hurts to have lost Ben Wallace. This team would be better with him (provided that the Wallace/Saunders feud didn't turn into a major distraction--which it VERY well could have). Long-term, we're going to be really happy that that contract isn't on our books. Signing him long-term would've done as much to \"screw up this decade\" as anything.\nIt's just another case of Simmons throwing jabs at a team that he has never liked (probably due to the feud with the Celtics back in the day). It's too bad, because otherwise that was"

I looked on Adobe's website, and I see there is a 30 day trial available, the price to buy Photoshop is out of my range. Does anyone know if the 30 day trial allows full use of the software without any sort of copyright on the images made with it or any other limitations during the trial period to where I could use that and make sure I get everything I want to done in 30 days? Is there another software available that is not quite as expensive that will open PSD files? Are there other types of software that I can try to make my own from scracth that won't open PSD files, but will create the templates, buttons and logo's I am in need of in a similar manner? Sorry for such a newbie question but I really don't know much about graphics creation software and what is the best all in one solution that is a little more affordable than Photoshop and I really don't have the extra funds to play the trial and error game of buying software only to get it home and find out that it doesn't do what I am really looking for.

From there, the project is refined, stone choices are selected, materials are ordered, and the project is scheduled in full consultation with the owner.\n\u201cOne of the first things I tell property owners in that we need to build a solid base, because what goes under the stone determines whether a project is going to last three years or 30 years. It\u2019s the most critical part of any project and if you don\u2019t get it right the design will eventually crumble,\u201d Martin says, noting they build a 9\u201d open graded base to ensure proper drainage.\nEach project is one-of-a-kind. Martin likes to bring his creative juices to each design. He\u2019s never backs down from a new idea, in fact it\u2019s the challenge of building something new that drives him and the business to grow and prosper. You name it, Martin has done or is doing it, handling only two to three projects at a time with about 12 dedicated full-time employees.\nGreen Ace Landscaping uses only the very best materials for all of its projects such as; Endurac"

But what are shoe trees, and why are they called that? Shoe trees are actually a relatively modern invention that were created to help shoes keep their shape. They come in different sizes, depending on the type of shoe you want to use them for.\nWhen looking for a pair of shoe trees, there are a few things to consider. The first is the size.

Shoe trees can range in price from a few dollars to upwards of $100.\nThese 100% cedar shoe trees leave your dressiest kicks smelling fresh.

Stratton\u2019s shoe tree comes in a value pack with multiple pairs for a great price.\nMoneysworth & Best\u2019s men\u2019s shoe tree is constructed to prolong the life of your shoe.

You can\u2019t assume that just because it\u2019s a \u201cveggie burger\u201d that it\u2019s plant-based or vegan friendly.\nEgg is a binding ingredient that is most often used in vegetable burger patties.\nWhat Ingredients in Vegetable Burgers Are Non-vegan?\nEgg is likely the most common ingredient used in veggie burger patties. It is used for its binding properties to hold the patty together.\nMilk is also used in veggie burger patties on occasion. Seems like they just put milk in everything sometimes doesn\u2019t it? Milk is not used as often as eggs, and are primarily to add moisture and flavor to the veggie burger patty.\nHow Can I be Sure My Veggie Burgers are Vegan?\nLook for a \u201cVegan\u201d label or logo.\nOne sure fire way to ensure you\u2019re eating vegan is to look for a logo stating just that. The downside to this is that not all vegan foods will be labeled and often enough the ones that are tend to be more expensive.\nInspect the ingredients list if you\u2019re buying them at a store.\nAsk your server if you\u2019re ordering from a restaurant.\nYou shouldn\u2019t be hesitant to ask your server at a restaurant which menu items are vegan. While it may seem awkward or uncomfortable at first, you\u2019ll find that it gets easier over time. You\u2019ll likely discover that some servers aren\u2019t as helpful or outwardly supportive as others. And that\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t dwell on any negative reaction you may get. It\u2019s their job, and you should never let anyone make you feel bad about doing something good for yourself.\nMake your own vegan veggie burgers.\nThe single most effective way to ensure that you are eating vegan burger patties is for them to be homemade! Making vegan burgers can be a lot of fun and there are endless combinations of delicious ingredients to include.

What caught my attention about this game though was that Gyeongnam weren\u2019t playing at their normal ground in Changwon, but were hosting the fixture thirty-odd miles away in Jinju.\nI find it hard to resist the chance to visit a new ground, particularly one that only gets used once a year and so I thought I might as well make the effort. Gyeongnam has previous for this sort of thing, they played a game at Geochang earlier in the season and have also staged matches at Masan, Milyang and Yangsan in the past. I have a feeling that they would probably play in your back garden if you offered them enough cash.\nIt reminds me a bit of the way that county cricket teams would share their fixtures around. Yorkshire would regularly visit Acklam Park whilst Durham would turn out now and then at Stockton Cricket Club. I\u2019m not sure to what extent it still goes on but I suspect it\u2019s less common these days than it was in the past.\nI got the bus from Seoul Express bus terminal at 8.20am. It was 22,000 won and they seem to run pretty frequently. The roads were clearer than normal and I arrived in Jinju on time at 12.10pm.\nI\u2019d actually been to Jinju before. I was there last year with my mate Paul either side of a hike up Jirisan. On that occasion though, we\u2019d seen the inside of a bar or two and the bus station, but not a great deal more. As I had plenty of time before the 3pm kick-off I wandered along to the fortress by the river which is okay for a quick visit.\nThere are a few old looking buildings inside the fortress walls that have been rebuilt over the years. There is also a rock that a local girl jumped off a few hundred years ago. She managed to drown a Japanese General by throwing herself into the river and dragging him in with her. There was none of that sort of thing going on whilst I was there, but with a visit from a K-League team once a year I suppose that the locals no longer feel the need to make their own entertainment.\nBe careful if you are a Japanese General.\nI\u2019d seen as much of the fortress as I wanted to by one o\u2019clock and thought that I might as well walk to the stadium. I\u2019d picked up a map earlier and it seemed easy enough, just follow the river until you get there. The river walk was quite pleasant. It was a bit overgrown but provided an opportunity to see some wildlife along the way, mainly butterflies and herons.\nJust keep the river to your right and you won't get lost.\nAs the time moved towards half past two I was getting a little worried that my map may not have been too accurate, but fortunately the stadium came into sight. It\u2019s a very impressive looking ground, built last year with a sensible capacity of twenty thousand.\nI got a ticket for eight thousand won and sat with a few lads that I know towards the back of one of side stands. The stadium was just as impressive inside as out, the highlight being a grassy bank behind one of the goals. It\u2019s a feature that I like and I\u2019ve enjoyed stretching out on the grass before at LA Galaxy and at Munhak for the baseball. I first encountered one at Wigan in the Boro\u2019s 1986-7 promotion season, but the climate in north-west England meant that it was more like a slag heap. It wasnt just the players who should have been wearing football boots that day.\nFC Seoul fans behind the goal.\nThere was an excellent turnout for the game, although as usual, people were still arriving well into the second half. At its peak, I\u2019d say the place was 95% full, although the announced attendance claimed an impressive 110% capacity at 22,000.\nAs far as the game went, it was always likely to end in tears for Gyeongnam. Seoul are having a far better season and needed a win themselves to clinch third place. Gyeongnam had a slim chance of making the play-offs but in addition to requiring three points they were also relying on two other teams failing to win.\nNot a great deal happened in the first hour. Seoul then broke the deadlock when a heavily deflected shot from Ha Dae Sung wrongfooted veteran keeper Kim Byeung Ji. Gyeongnam\u2019s task was made a little harder when they had a bloke sent off for something off the ball. I didn\u2019t see what happened but unfortunately for Jeong Da Hooeon the ref did.\nGyeongnam pushed forward despite being a man down and were then caught twice as Ha Dae Sung completed his hat-trick. In the end results elsewhere meant that the three-nil defeat didn\u2019t matter. A lot of the crowd had gome home early once Seoul got on top, but it was still busy on the way out. As I left I was passed by about a hundred Korean RAF lads marching in formation.\nThe traffic was heavier on the way back to Seoul"

We have fought face to face with devils, demons, dragons death knights, deaders and other diseased disasters, but this is the first time we have retreated multiple times, cunning little buggers. They are using the strange magic Burlap was trained in, and just like Burlap\u2019s magic it was clever, funny and painful, all at the same time.\nMaybe there is a grain of truth that Kobolds might be faerie kin, but that is neither here nor there. A small group of Kobolds managed to hold us up longer than all the fights we have had against ReSet put together, and the attacks are deadlier, probably because the Kobolds used guile and Reset kept used brawn, and brawn usually loses to the brawnier person, so guile is their best bet, and It worked, even Xerx\u2019ses decided that disgression might be worthwhile so we could figure out what to do.\nHowever CrIsis managed to extricate ourselves, proving you can\u2019t keep a good Bear down.\nWe had spent the evening because Hannah was using her special method of interrogation and getting info while we waited, well I didn\u2019t just wait, the plan needed us to get back to New Crests so I used the magic of Isis to create a scroll to return us to the temple there. We then headed to the Library again and those little hairy bastards ambushed us, thankfully with the magic granted to my eyes by Isis I managed to pinpoint their strange portal attack magics and well what can I say, they poked the bear and the bear poked back.\nWe even managed to capture one, a bowman, we kept his bow and sent him on his way, happily enough he just left, so I poked Ja\u2019Deir until he used his mental prowess to track the owner of the bow so we knew where he was, and if he was part of another ambush we would be able to avoid it, which we did, we actually made it to the Library to gather together the books we needed, and then we used the scroll to return to New Crests and the Temple of the Sun there, afterwards we loaded up Rogtilda well after the repairs were finished, and then headed on to the Famous Library of Bletharad.\nThe Sea was as it always was, with the weather changing more often than Hannah\u2019s moods, but we still arrived at Bletherad at the Festival of Osiris. We decided to Celebrate, and the nameless one showed us a Tavern and we started eating and drinking and being merry, and I bet tales of that night will be told for years afterwards. I decided to take a page out of Hannah\u2019s book and have fun, after Ursus had had a decent amount of Alcohol, you know 10 kegs or so, I started using magic to have fun with him, from floating his tankard (slightly smaller keg) around the room with telekinesis, to making alcohol barrels talk, and turning rocks into flesh and making Rock Steak it was a fun night. Xerx\u2019ses seemed to get into the mood and had also lit the place up, and somehow made his lights strobe and flicker. Ursus managed to find some love and maybe No Name did too. Ursus was walking around with Eyes, and I swear I saw Xerx\u2019ses walk into the main room, then into the back room and half a second walk into the front room from the front with some women from the boat. He is certainly exploring his sexuality in what I\u2019d say is unusual ways, but who knows the mating rituals of the Minotaur race. No Name certainly tried for various drinking records, but as i was slightly inebriated at the time im not sure how successful he and Ursus were, but checking in on them showed that they were certainly happy to party.\nWe retired to Rogtilda at various times during the night/morning, and I Negated Toxins on myself and went down to the beach to watch and paint the sunrise, then crawled into bed a happy man.<|endoftext|>Comfortable and stylish, this Les Voiles De Saint-Tropez shirt is an ideal choice for every occasion.\nStylish, sporty and strong: a comfortable stretch Poplin Les Voiles De Saint-Tropez shirt with a point collar.

Millions died, a significant portion of the entire population. There was the Ganghwa massacre, Geochang massacre, No Gun Ri Massacre, Seoul National University Hospital massacre, Sinchon Massacre, and Sancheong-Hamyang massacre. Tens of thousands of South Korean soldiers starved to death when their commanding officers embezzled funds earmarked for their food.\n\nEven after the war civilians continued to be massacred. The Bodo League massacre alone saw US educated South Korean President Syngman Rhee order the execution of over 100,000 suspected South Korean leftist sympathizers and their families. His political opponents were assassinated and protesters were shot. Eventually the people of South Korea marched on Blue House and the CIA evacuated Rhee to retire in Hawaii. This was not the end, when the people finally had a democratically elected leader a military coup took place and the US continued to provide support as the new order terrorised it's own citizens.\n\nI could go on but this is well documented history, instead here are some quotes from high-ranking members of the US forces involved in war:\n\n&gt; We burned down just about every city in North Korea and South Korea both [...] We killed off over a million civilian Koreans and drove several million more from their homes, with the inevitable additional tragedies bound to ensue.\n\n- Gen. Curtis LeMay\n\n&gt; I would say that the entire, almost the entire Korean Peninsula is a terrible mess. Everything is destroyed, [...] There is nothing left standing worthy of the name.\n\n- Gen. Emmett E. \u201cRosie\u201d O\u2019Donnell, Jr.\n\n&gt; I shrink\u2014I shrink with a horror that I cannot express in words\u2014at this continuous slaughter of men in Korea,\n\n- Gen. Douglas MacArthur.\n\nThe eventual recovery of South Korea was thanks to industrialisation and the admirable spirit of her people who have, time and again, laid down their lives to fight corruption and tyranny.<|endoftext|>When you think about your boobs do you ever stop and think about how they could impact your mental health?\nI'm a person with an anxiety disorder and depression. It's not out of the ordinary for me on a bad day to cancel my plans because I can't find a shirt that \"feels\" right on my skin.\n\nIt turns out, that maybe I should. Our boobs are something we struggle with as women. No one it seems is perfectly pleased with the way that their boobs look. But this dissatisfaction can have seriously negative results on a woman's health and happiness.\nStudies about women's breasts and mental health reveal some pretty shocking truths that make it clear that we need to change the way society teaches women to think about their bodies. It's literally a matter of life and death.\n70% of women report feeling unhappy about their breast size. That's right, being told your boobs are too small or too big, and being unhappy with how they look, can cause general unhappiness. This unhappiness is a driving force for women who are getting breast augmentations, which is still the number one most popular cosmetic surgery being performed today.\nBecause being a teenager isn't hard enough, as a developing woman it can feel miserable to develop too slowly and feel left behind. It can also make you feel miserable to develop big breasts too quickly. Studies have shown that girls who develop big breasts early are at higher risk for eating disorders, drug use, and depression. 3% of all breast augmentations performed in this country are performed on girls between the ages of 13 and 19.\nSize isn't the only factor that affects women mentally about their breasts. A recent study showed that women with asymmetrical breasts were far more likely to suffer from low self-esteem than other women polled. They feel stigmatized by clothing companies for being different, and by their peers for not looking the way they do.\nWhile plastic surgery is indeed an option for most women and one that countless women have found to be helpful, there are some things that just can't be erased by a doctor's scalpel.\nThe emotional toll of living with unsatisfactory breasts can be brutal. Six major studies have found that women with breast implants are FIVE TIMES more likely to kill themselves than other women. They also have a higher rate of psychiatric hospitalization due in part to the low self-esteem and depression that can be caused by how a woman sees her breasts.<|endoftext|>package shiver.me.timbers.http.servlet;\n\nimport org.junit.Test;\nimport shiver.me.timbers.http.Header;\nimport shiver.me.timbers.http.Headers;\n\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;\n\nimport static java.util.Arrays.asList;\nimport static org.mockito.BDDMockito.given;\nimport static org.mockito.BDDMockito.then;\nimport static org.mockito.Mockito.mock;\nimport static org.mockito.Mockito.verifyZeroInteractions;\nimport static shiver.me.timbers.data.random.RandomStrings.someString;\n\npublic class HeadersWriterTest {\n\n    @Test\n    public void Can_write_headers() {\n\n        final Headers headers = mock(Headers.class);\n        final HttpServletResponse response = mock(HttpServletResponse.class);\n\n        final Header header1 = mock(Header.class);\n        final Header header2 = mock(Header.class);\n        final Header header3 = mock(Header.class);\n        final String name1 = someString();\n        final String name2 = someString();\n        final String name3 = someString();\n        final String value1 = someString();\n        final String value2 = someString();\n        final String value3 = someString();\n\n        // Given\n        given(headers.iterator()).willReturn(asList(header1, header2, header3).iterator());\n        given(header1.getName()).willReturn(name1);\n"

Our proposals come with modelling and we can also provide finance through our partners.\nAvoid bill shock, monitor, then manage to save energy and reduce costs. Most businesses have no idea of how much energy they are using at any point in time. So they cannot optimise the return on the investment made. Contact us to see how you can become a smart energy user.\nWith most homes only utilising about half of their solar energy generation and feed-in tariffs now around the 10 cents mark it is no wonder that many homeowners are looking at battery storage to get their utilisation up to above 80%.\nGet your solar system back into action quickly. Be confident your system is working effectively and at no risk to you and your family. We do all types and sizes of grid-based residential solar system repairs. If your solar system is out of warranty we can support you to get back into generation.\nIf you live in a remote location and are using a lot of energy, we can offer a large solar array and installation services to help with your farming, pumping and production needs.\nOur team has the expertise and experience to cut through the confusion. Our job is to bring together the various methods, products and services to help businesses become more self-sufficient, or at least to start using energy as efficiently as possible!\nTo enable cost reductions and predictability, and improve to the bottom line, all you have to do is to receive complementary bill analysis.\nEnergy is necessary however the unpredictable cost for all businesses and many others is a significant variable expense. We understand that it can be difficult even to navigate your energy bills, let alone to stay abreast of all the information about how to improve efficiency and make savings.\nPlus, then it still needs to be implemented by a trusted energy provider and professional.\nWe help your organisation unlock your full energy-saving potential.

However, you are dealing directly with the installer. This allows us to offer not only professional installation via our own team and installers, but pass the savings of supplier direct.\nAn avid supporter of Clean Energy, Lucas is at the forefront of Solar and Battery generation and sees the continuing move to renewables and self-sufficiency in both commercial and residential production as being key to our future productivity and energy security.\nLucas supported his early Renewable Energy experience with positions on the board of The Australian Solar Council and The Energy Storage Council, during a turbulent policy period for the Renewable Energy Industry.<|endoftext|>Fall was coming to an end at the base of Mount Jiri near the banks of the Seomjin River where a small hanok, or traditional Korean house, was being built.\nThe hanok is surrounded by the beauty of nature. The river flows in front and the mountain looms in the background. It is located in Baekuncheon Village, Gurae County, South Jeolla.\nOn a recent visit, the house was still in the middle of construction. Sawdust flew everywhere. Piles of stone and lumber were stacked around the courtyard. But there was something interesting and unusual about this hanok construction crew \u2015 amid the thunderous noise of electric saws, a strong South American beat permeated the worksite.\nTall people with blue eyes, reggae hairstyles and a long beards were busy running around the site toting planks. The mix of language included English, Spanish and Korean. Shouts of \u201cDavid! Cut longer\u201d and \u201cJohn! Trae lo aqui,\u201d which means \u201cbring it here,\u201d punctured the air. This hanok was being built by foreigners enjoying an adventure in the Korean countryside, David Eisele, Nicolas Rousseau, Jeffery Lozar and John Herresa.\nEisele, a 28-year-old German, said Mount Jiri is amazing and he hates cities. He still has yet to visit Seoul.\nFor a foreigner who has been in Korea less than 10 months, his command of the Korean language is fluent. Eisele, who grew up in southern Germany, studied carpentry for three years after graduating from high school. He traveled around the world with money he earned from carpentry in France, Spain and Mexico.\nWith his global experience, Eisele was fluent not only in his native German, but also in English, French and Spanish. Thanks to his multilingual ability, one of his many tasks was interpretation among the foreigners and Koreans at the worksite.\nWhile learning to become a carpenter in Germany, Eisele saw a video on Asian architecture and became curious about how the triangular roofs were built. During a trip to France he made friends with a 26-year-old Korean named Chan-yeon.\nEisele then visited Chan-yeon\u2019s hometown of Busan in February of this year and traveled by bicycle from Namhae, Geochang to Namwon along the southern coast of the Korean Peninsula.\nDavid Eisele puts modern tools to work on a traditional project.\nPerhaps it was destiny that during his trip he also met carpenter Kim Gil-su, who was building a hanok at the bottom of Mount Jiri. Kim decided to hire the German carpenter, who was skilled with his hands, on the spot.\nWhen asked about the attractive features of hanok, the German said he appreciates the connections between the pieces of wood without the use of nails. He said in ancient Europe, arc-shaped structures used similar methods.\nIn learning about hanok construction for six months, Eisele became something of an expert \u2015 from measuring the size of the building to smoothing lumber and fixing window frames. He earns 80,000 won ($86) a day. The German carpenter said that in Europe, carpenters earn twice what they make in Korea.\nBut this escapade, he says, is not really about money. Building the hanok is more about fun, friendship and a cultural experience. Eisele said his plan after the hanok is to travel the rest of Asia with the money he has earned. Other than learning the"

She had a thought that maybe she could make her own products? She started reading peer reviewed journals about skin, how it works and how natural oils interact with it. After a while, she was able to come up with a formulation that was able to solve her dry skin problem. She then made a formulation that managed to keep my father's seborrheic dermatitis at bay.Then she started to solve skin problems for friends, it became a hobby and she found that she was good at it.\nBefore long, these friends were coming back and asking for more. Then friends of those friends would get in touch after asking what those friends had been doing with their skin. At some point, between them they decided that they should probably create a company. My father is a graphic designer so he designed up packaging and they started selling it locally. Almost entirely by word of mouth the brand grew slowly. At one point and by accident really... the brand ended up being stocked in America exclusively through plastic surgeons and dermatologists. I actually went over there when I was 18 and worked with the company as an intern for 3 months but then decided that I really didn't want to work in skincare (what an idiot).\nHowever after a while there was a falling out with the American distributors around the time I was 20 and almost all business into the USA fell flat. After that, the business meandered a bit and eventually was shut down completely when my parents got divorced in 2007.\nI have always been a dreamer. I have never had realistic goals. When I was in high school, I assumed I would be a celebrity by the time I was 21. I started my first band when I was 14 and we would play wherever we could. Over the years I did various musical projects, I did a bit of acting, studied tv presenting at Max Rowley Media Academy and won more awards than they had ever given out in the 30 years they'd been operating. However after a few years of trying, I never got as much as one job. I continued to make music and act in short films while working in cafe's as a barista.\nI was quite passionate about my coffee making and in 2007 I came second in a national latte art championship. But... I never had even a small amount of break through in any of my creative pursuits. I had always believed that I had the ability to make it as a creative, however when I was 28 I went through a bad break up. The break up was my decision and I broke a heart. The only reason I include this detail is that I would hate for that person to feel as though I was blaming them. Anyway, I decided it was time to grow up. I decided to sell out.\nI thought I would put my creative abilities towards a career in advertising. I had a friend called Steve Coll who I had gotten to know through my ex who was a bit of a rockstar in advertising. He'd just won the Cannes Grand Prix for Creative Effectiveness for the Walkers 'Sandwich' campaign. He is a rare amazing person who I have a lot of respect for and many times as I have been going about the business of shaping the man I want to be, I have kept him in mind. He had just taken the job as Executive Creative Director at an ad agency that is now known as Havas.\nI called him up and could barely get the words out through the tears I was crying at the time. I had experienced so much failure in my life and at 28 I asked him if I could come and work for him if I worked for free. I figured I could work in a cafe on the weekend and I would fight and I would survive and I would win in the end. He kept his composure and said that he though that sounded like a great idea and that he thought I would be good at it. He gave me a paid internship as a copywriter and was very generous with his time and helped mentor me through the process.\nIt is not an easy thing to take on an internship as a broke 28 year old and advertising can be a bit of a lions den, but I was determined to succeed. I remember I would just repeat in my head \"I'm going to win\" over and over. The first weekend I was there I worked over the weekend (I didn't have a job as a barista at that time). The agency had to get a promo video done and I knew how to edit video because of all the short films I had made. I said yes to any opportunity I could and had the opportunity to work with brands like Mortein (the save Louey the Fly campaign), Clearasil, Woolmark and a few others. However after the 3 months of my internship were up, the company had a hiring freeze imposed, so Steve was given the difficult job of telling me and the other intern I was working alongside were told that they were sorry but they couldn't offer employment. Then, after a week of processing that. Steve took me to coffee and told me that the agency had wrangled to keep one intern but that they were keeping my partner. He said it had nothing to do with my work. He said that my work was great, but Jack, my partner had more history with the agency and he was very sorry.\nTo this day I think he made the right decision. He was a better fit with the agency and to be honest I'm glad I'm not in advertising. Anyway... Steve put his money where his mouth was and told me he was going to try and get me a job somewhere. He got me an interview with the Executive Creative Director at an agency called 303 which is now called 303 Lowe. Before I went, Steve briefed me up and told me that Executive Creative Directors are very time poor and I"

We have the ability to customize that to each factory. This approach assists in quality and throughput time from the factory resulting in a garment that meets the specifications. How we get there may be delegated is to us from the client.\nSamples are a necessary part of the business for a various reasons. Sample submission would demonstrate that we have the competency to construct the garment according to the tailoring that\u2019s necessary. It shows that all the machinery is present and working properly for what may be needed all the way through to the buttonholes and pressing.\nFabric sourcing is a global exercise involving the whole world of different types of fabrics from synthetics through natural fabrics to organic fabrics. We work with suppliers who may be jobbers for small orders, or we work directly with the mills on shore in the United States, Canada, Mexico or Latin America, or with foreign mills in the Far East in India. We\u2019ve purchased from all of those countries.\nFull package is a term in the industry used to denote that the vendor is supplying the fabric in addition to patterns, cutting, sewing, and trim. This approach is usually selected by a client selling the end product but does not have the capability or desire to be involved in fabric sourcing. We will do full package to conform to the client\u2019s product specifications.\nOne of the most important documents in manufacturing is the production schedule which would show the progress of a purchase order is in the system from receipt to delivery. On the production schedules issued to clients weekly, we report when we have fabric and trim on hand, the cutting status of the fabric, and expected exit factory date and in warehouse receipt date.\nSourcing would include fabric and trim items, as well as manufacturing sourcing. For production sourcing Greco Apparel utilizes a pre-determined group of factories in each product category with whom we have years of experience and know that they can supply us with reliable quality garments that are delivered on time.\nLogistics encompasses management of the supply chain. This is an area we deal with every day from monitoring that the fabric gets shipped for on time arrival in the factory. We also track that we have necessary markers available and that trim and accessories are ordered for on time delivery.\nFabric generally refers to shell goods \u2013 the material of which the garments are made. We do sourcing of the material. It can come from anywhere in the world. One needs to be conscious of the trade laws to determine which fabric is coming from where.<|endoftext|>C\u00e1c t\u1eeb \u0111i\u1ec3n: B\u1ea3n quy\u1ec1n b\u1edfi Merriam Webster.

There had already been seven plagues, each following the same formula: Moshe and Aharon re-present the L-rd's demand to Pharaoh that he should let the people of Israel go, he refuses and they announce the next plague which then duly happens. After the seventh plague, Pharaoh at last admits his sin against G-d (9:27), then hardens his heart once the hail and rain stop, just as Moshe said he would. Perhaps Moshe was starting to feel like the prophet Yonah was to feel some hundreds of years later when sent by G-d to the city of Nin'veh - that he didn't want to go because he knew what was going to happen.\nRashi tells us that Moshe was commanded to warn Pharaoh of the judgement that was still to come. Pharaoh himself had hardened his own heart after the lifting of the last plague, so it was not yet a foregone conclusion that the full series of plagues and the death of the first-born would have to happen; there was still an option for Pharaoh to come round and be obedient to G-d's demands. Yet we read that after this point, in this week's parasha, in the conversations in and around the last three plagues, Adonai hardened Pharaoh's heart. It is as if, once past a certain point, instead of Pharaoh doing the hardening, the L-rd took over so as to complete the process not only of rescuing our people from Egypt, but defeating the Egyptian gods and demonstrating His power to Egyptian and Hebrew alike.\nThis resonates with what the New Covenant Scriptures tell us, \"The L-rd is not slow in keeping His promise, as some people think of slowness; on the contrary, He is patient with you; for it is not His purpose that anyone should be destroyed, but that everyone should turn from his sins. However, the Day of the L-rd will come, 'like a thief'\" (2 Peter 3:9-10, CJB). G-d is patient, giving each of us many opportunities to come to know Him, to obey Him in various ways, both in starting out on our walk with Him and along the way while He is fashioning us into the image of His Son. But a day does come when it is too late; a time is reached when G-d's purposes cannot be held back any longer - then G-d's plan rolls forward and those who are obstructing it are cast in their (own, chosen) roles as obstructors and detractors, although G-d continues to use them in those roles to accomplish His purposes.\nThat is why Rav Sha'ul wrote to the Corinthians, \"Working together with Him, we also urge you not to receive the grace of G-d in vain - for He says, 'At the acceptable time I listened to you, and on the day of salvation I helped you;' behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation (2 Cor 6:2-3, NASB).\nApplication: Each of us needs to be certain that we are not resisting the purposes of G-d in our lives. We need to know Him and move forward with Him every day. Consult your heart and ask G-d to confirm where you stand with Him today.<|endoftext|>New cleaner rendering of shadows.\nIncreased the coverage to all mountain ranges world wide.\nAdded subtle shades to the landscape.

In this report, the European Commission concludes that patients have to be better informed about the options they have and the procedures they need to follow in order to benefit from cross-border healthcare. Citizens should find out about their rights with the National Contact Points. At present, all EU Member States have at least one in place.\nThe report suggests further improvement in the way some countries grant prior authorisation. It recognises that the low demand for cross-border healthcare can be a result of other factors (e.g. unwillingness of patients to travel, language barriers, price differentials and acceptable waiting times for treatment).\nAccording to the report, the Cross-Border Directive has contributed to a number of positive reforms in national healthcare systems. The advance of telemedicine (health services provided remotely) is likely to become more significant in the future. The report recommends developing or clarifying current EU rules on how access to and reimbursement for this kind of healthcare is done at national level.<|endoftext|>Get a little batty this Halloween and send all the goblins on your list the No Tricks Just Treats Halloween Goodie Bucket filled with all the traditional favorites and a few new tasty treats.\nGift Includes: Halloween candy bowl, 12 oz white cheddar popcorn, Fluffy stuff cotton candy, Halloween marshmallow peeps, Twizzlers candy, M & M Cookies, Microwave Halloween popcorn, Payday candy bar, Reese's Pieces candy, Twix chocolate bar, Sweet Tarts candy, York peppermint Patty, Mini dots candy box, Mini Milk Duds candies, Pretzel M & M candies, Plain M & M candies, Hershey milk chocolate candy bar, Reese's peanut butter cups, 6 assorted chocolate mini candy bars and topped with a festive Happy Halloween handmade bow.

Here is a list of them all, starting with our current Guild Leader Kazh, who is coming up on 10 years in the position. Raid Leader Rapitiss, has been leading us to victory for 5 years. And Alsmack has been maintaining our technology for 11 years.\n2013 - Light The Night - Chitiwok organized and led a 26 hour EQ Raid Marathon on Bertoxxulous in Nizzi's honor, after he was diagnosed with Leukemia. This Raid Marathon was promoted and supported by SoE via their social media channels, and was very well attended--including players who transferred from other Servers to add support. It was estimated up to 100 players rotated in throughout the event.\nFor 26 hours we mass-raided content throughout Norrath, it was one of the most fun and memorable events in EQ History. Raid Loot was awarded after the wins, while SoE added contests and awarded additional items such as posters, game cash cards, and traditional Fan Faire prizes. We made sure the $15 SoE game-cash cards were awarded to those who needed to transfer back to their own servers! Chitiwok and Alsmack streamed the event on Twitch. At the end of the 26 hours, Nizzi, Kyreth, Chitiwok, and Alsmack were the last players standing.\nThat EQ Marathon raised over $5000 for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.\nAll EoK Raids and Achievements Done!\nEternal Sovereign has completed all ToV Raids, and we continue to farm that content--on both Mains AND Alts.\nWe also have an excellent Raid Strategist in Rapitiss, who is leading us back through some older content to complete those raids, as well as the Challenger Achievements which net even more goodies for us.\nEoK Raids are now complete, thank you Rapitiss and ES Raiders for these bold efforts.

They also are well connected to buses and subways, enabling you to reach your final destination with ease. The KTX (Korea Train Express) is fastest and the most expensive, followed by the Saemaeul and the Mugunghwa.\n(1) KTX KTX tickets can be reserved through ticket boxes at stations, travel agencies, automatic ticket issuance machines and the website (www.korail.com). Reservations and ticketing services are available from 09:00 a.m. and reservations can be made from two months to one hour before the time of departure. If the party making reservations is different from the party who will use the train, the party making reservations is responsible for the payment of the fare.\n(2) Saemaeul Train Saemaeul trains are better passenger trains and travel faster than Mugungwha trains, as the number of stops is fewer. For reservations, visit the ticket box of the stations, travel agencies, automatic ticket issuance machines or the website (www.korail.com).\n(3) Mugungwha Train Mugungwha trains are operated on every Korail route. Not every train stops at every station, and a selective stop system is used to reduce travel time while maximizing the number of stations served.\n6_Airlines Traveling by air saves time when traveling long distances, but is more expensive compared to other forms of transportation. Domestic airlines include Korean Airlines, Asiana Airlines, Jeju Air, Eastar Air, and Jin Air. These airlines operate along the following routes: Seoul/Incheon-Busan, Seoul/Incheon-Jeju, Seoul/Incheon-Daegu, Seoul-Ulsan, Seoul-Gwangju, Seoul-Jinhae, Seoul-Gangneung, etc. However, Jeju Air, Eastar Air, and Jin Air offer fewer routes. Tickets can be purchased at airports, or booked in advance by phone, internet, or through travel agencies.\n6>> Use of Public Administration 1_Public Administrative Bodies The main public administration offices include Eup Office, Myeon Office, Dong Community Center, City Office, Gun Office and Gu Office. These offices manage affairs related to the health and welfare of residents, the management of public facilities, the issuance of diverse certificates and the registration of diverse issues. Eup Offices, Myeon Offices and Dong Community Centers operate a wide range of programs, including cultural lectures for local residents.

But the popularity of the funds varies, with investors in Australia showing almost no interest in trading the recently-launched ETFs there.\nAustralia is the region that stands out the most for its lack of interest in bitcoin ETFs, where the first such ETFs launched as recently as April this year. Since then until June 2, ETFs in the country have only amassed BTC 199 (USD 5.96m), data from crypto researcher Arcane Research shows, as shared by their analyst Vetle Lunde.\nThe weak interest in this region stands in sharp contrast to Europe, where local ETPs (exchange-traded products) have BTC 92,256 (USD 2.76bn) under management, the highest number of all regions.\nMeanwhile, Europe was followed by Canada as the region with the second-highest number of bitcoin under management, with BTC 75,333 (USD 2.25bn) held by Canadian ETFs as of June 3, the data showed.\nAccording to Arcane Research analyst Vetle Lunde, the muted interest in bitcoin ETFs among Australian investors can be partly explained by the fact that the first ETFs there launched around the same time as the collapse of LUNA and the Terra ecosystem happened.\n\u201c[T]hese ETFs launched at the worst time possible,\u201d Lunde told Cryptonews.com, explaining that the launch happened at \u201cthe peak of the wide de-risking across all equities\u201d and on top of the crypto market meltdown that was ignited by the collapse of LUNA and terraUSD (UST).\nHe added that flows into Australian bitcoin ETFs are likely to strengthen over time, and opined that the ETF known as EBTC issued by ETFS Management stands to benefit the most due to its direct exposure to bitcoin.\nAn important thing to note when looking at the data is that, unlike in Europe and Canada, there is still no bitcoin spot-based ETF approved in the US. Instead, investors in the US domestic market are left with bitcoin futures-backed ETFs, which invariably ends up costing the investor more.\nAnd although many hopeful bitcoin investors have waited patiently for years already, Arcane\u2019s analyst said that things are happening which make it likely that such an ETF will soon get approved in the US.\n\u201c[O]dds are in favor of an ETF approval some time in 2023,\u201d Lunde said.\nAmong the positive factors that could make a difference is the new crypto bill from two US senators, as well as a rule change filing by crypto exchange FTX that would allow it to clear trades directly without going through middlemen.\nNotably, the lack of interest among Australians came despite the fact that the inflows into bitcoin ETFs globally have increased in recent months.\nFrom having BTC 188,091 under management in April to BTC 197,86 in May, the amount of bitcoin under management by ETFs globally had already reached BTC 205,008 three days into the month of June, marking an increase of BTC 7,152 in just three days.\nThe inflows serve as proof that investors have not given up on the number one cryptocurrency despite heavy losses over the past two months, and are instead taking advantage of the lower prices to accumulate more coins.\nFrom a price of more than USD 45,000 on April 1, BTC was down by about 33% to USD 30,000 as of Friday at 08:30 UTC. Over the past week, the price was down by 1.4% at the same time.<|endoftext|>Maintaining a healthy mind and proper mindset take a focused effort.

        "passage": " samples revealed presence of bovine rotavirus A in three diagnostic tests. The histopathological changes were found almost exclusively limited in the small intestine. The lesions of rotaviral enteritis ranged from slight to moderate shortening (atrophy) of villi in the jejunum and ileum with necrotic crypts. The villi were blunt and covered by immature epithelial cells. Infected cells, stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin staining method, showed characteristic syncytia and eosinophilc intracytoplasmic inclusion body. The presence of intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in enterocytes is the indication of viral etiology. The presence of rotavirus in the affected tissues and/or lesions was confirmed by three different immunological and molecular tests. The findings of histopathological changes will be helpful in future diagnosis of rotaviral infection in dead calves.\nStatement of the Problem: Diarrhea is a major cause of death in young calves. This causes great economic damage to the livestock industry. These diarrhea cause dehydration, decrease blood flow, lower the pH and degrade enzyme function. In the past, serum screening was not possible in the field. However, now with the spread of portable serum testing devices, it is now possible to conduct tests directly on field. Thus, accurate serological changes can be identified and used in the field of large animals. Methodology and Theoretical Orientation: The test groups were calves from 1 to 44 days old. The status of the feces was divided into four grade to determine the severity of diarrhea (grade 0,1,2,3). Grade 0, 1 is considered to have no diarrhea. Grade 2, 3 is considered to diarrhea positive group. One or more viruses were detected in this group. Diarrhea negasitive group consisted of 57 calves (Asan=30, Samrye=27). Diarrhea positive group consisted of 34 calves (Kimje=27, Geochang=7). The feces of all calves were analyzed by PCR Test. Blood sample was measured using an automatic blood analyzer(i-STAT, Abbott inc. Illinois, US). Calves were divided into 3 groups according to age. Group 1 is 1 to 14 days old. Group 2 is 15 to 28 days old. Group 3 is more than 28 days old. Findings: Diarrhea caused an increase in HCT due to dehydration. The difference from normal was highest in 15 to 28 days old (p < 0.01). At all ages, bicarbonate decreased compared to normal, and therefore pH decreased. Similar to HCT, the largest difference was observed between 15 and 28 days (p < 0.01). The pCO\u2082 decreases to compensate for the decrease in pH. Conclusion and Significance: At all ages, HCT increases, and bicarbonate, pH, and pCO\u2082 decrease in diarrhea calves. The calf from 15 days to 28 days shows the most difference from normal. Over 28 days of age, weight gain and homeostasis ability increase, diarrhea is seen in the stool, there are fewer hematologic changes than groups below 28 days of age.\nLivestock ownership is simultaneously linked to improved nutritional status through increased availability of animal-source protein, and increased risk of enteric infections through higher exposure to contaminated water sources. Agrarian and agro-pastoral households, especially those with cattle, goats, and sheep, are highly dependent on seasonally various environmental conditions, which directly impact nutrition and health. This study explores global spatiotemporally explicit evidence regarding the relationship between livestock ownership, enteric infections, and malnutrition. Seasonal and cyclical fluctuations, as well as mediating effects, are further examined to elucidate health and nutrition outcomes of individual and communal livestock ownership. The US Agency for International Development\u2019s Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund\u2019s Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) provide valuable sources of household-level information on anthropometry, asset ownership, and disease outcomes. These data are especially important in data-sparse regions, where surveys may only be conducted in the aftermath of emergencies. Child-level disease history, anthropometry, and household-level asset ownership information have been collected since DHS-V (2003-present) and MICS-III (2005-present). This analysis combines over 15 years of survey data from DHS and MICS to study 2,466,257 children under age five from 82 countries. Subnational (administrative level 1) measures of diarrhea prevalence, mean livestock ownership by type, mean and median anthropometric measures (height for age, weight for age, and weight for height) were investigated. Effects of several environmental, market, community, and household-level determinants were studied. Such covariates included precipitation, temperature, vegetation, the market price of staple cereals and animal source proteins, conflict events, livelihood zones, wealth indices and access to water, sanitation, hygiene, and public health services. Children aged 0 \u2013 6 months, 6 months \u2013 2 years, and 2 \u2013 5 years of age were compared separately. All observations were standardized to interview day of year, and administrative units were harmonized for consistent comparisons over time. Geographically weighted regressions were constructed for each outcome and subnational unit. Preliminary results demonstrate the importance of accounting for seasonality in concurrent assessments of malnutrition and enteric infections. Household assets, including livestock, often determine the intensity of these outcomes. In many regions, livestock ownership affects seasonal fluxes in malnutrition and enteric infections, which are also directly affected by environmental and local factors. Regression analysis demonstrates the spatiotemporal variability in nutrition outcomes due to a variety of causal factors. This analysis presents a synthesis of evidence from global survey data on the interrelationship between enteric infections, malnutrition, and livestock. These results provide a starting point for locally appropriate interventions designed to address this nexus in a timely manner and simultaneously improve health, nutrition, and livelihoods.\nEnterotoxigenic Escherichia coli is one of the leading causes of diarrhea in infants and travelers in developing countries. Colonization factors play an important role in pathogenesis and are one of the main targets for Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) vaccine development. However, ETEC vaccines had poorly performed in the past, as the prevalence of colonization factors is region-dependent. There are more than 25 classical colonization factors presently known to be expressed by ETEC, although all are not expressed together. Further, there are other multiple non-classical virulence factors that are also identified. Here the presence and expression of common classical and non-classical virulence factors were studied. Further studies were done on the expression of prevalent colonization factors in different strains. For the prevalence determination, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed, which was confirmed by simplex PCR. Quantitative RT-PCR was done to study the RNA expression of these virulence factors. Strains negative for colonization factors expression were confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Among the clinical isolates, the most prevalent toxin was est+elt, followed by est and elt, while the pattern was reversed in the control strains. There were 29% and 40% strains negative for any classical colonization factors (CF) or non-classical virulence factors (NCVF) among the clinical and control strains, respectively. Among CF positive ETEC strains, CS6 and CS21 were the prevalent ones in the clinical strains, whereas in control strains, CS6 was the predominant one. For NCVF genes, eatA was the most prevalent among the clinical isolates and etpA for control. CS6 was the most expressed CF, and eatA was the predominantly expressed NCVF for both clinical and controlled ETEC isolates. CS6 expression was more in strains having CS6 alone. Different strains express CS6 at different levels. Not all strains expressed their respective virulence factors. Understanding the prevalent colonization factor, CS6, and its nature of expression will contribute to designing an effective vaccine against ETEC in this region of the globe. The expression pattern of CS6 also will help in examining the relatedness between the ETEC subtypes.\nIsosporiasis is an affliction caused by coccidial protozoa belonging to genera Isospora spp. or Cystoisospora spp., which may parasitize the small and large intestines of dogs, of which neonates and young animals present higher risk of infection. This study aims at reporting a case of isosporiasis in neonate Pitbull dogs, as well as the diagnosis and treatment. Seven Pitbull puppies were admitted to the S\u00e3o Paulo State University (UNESP) Veterinary Hospital, Botucatu, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, with history of yellowish diarrhea without mucus or blood for the past two days. The animals were five days old. The history of the mother, a primiparous two-year-old, revealed that she was properly vaccinated, not de-wormed and did not present diarrhea. The clinical examination revealed that the neonates weighted between 308 and 360 grams, and presented normal reflexes, moderate dehydration, body temperatures between 36.8 and 37.2 \u00baC, blood sugar between 103 and 124 mg/dL and normal appetite. A full blood count and a parasitology assay were performed to aid in the diagnosis. The full blood count detected eosinophilia, without any other relevant alterations. The parasitology assay (Willis-Molly & Faust) revealed the presence of Cystoisospora spp. The treatment was instituted with heated fluid therapy with Ringer\u2019s Lactate (4 mL/100 g, subcutaneous) and antibiotic therapy with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (15 mg/kg, orally) every 12 hours for ten days. The mother and other dogs that came in contact with the newborns were also treated. The environment was disinfected for 10 minutes with 1.6% quaternary ammonium. After 10 days, the newborns presented normal clinical signs and no alterations in the full blood count. Isosporiasis is an affliction with high mortality rates in litters that should be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible to increase the survival rates in these patients.\nChildren"

January, who played Betty Draper on the hit AMC show, is evidently a fan of Erika's.\nThe t-shirt that January is wearing is of Erika's famous song, \"XXpen$ive.\" It shows a provocative illustration of Erika posing in front of a white car in Beverly Hills.\nErika was seen last season performing in concert and making the video for it.\nSome of the actress' fans also love Erika Jayne, with one commenting that the \"RHOBH\" cast member is the \"21st century Betty.\" Others wrote that they want an Erika Jayne shirt, too, and are clamoring to know where they can get one. Fans on both Instagram pages want to know where they can purchase the t-shirt. A simple online search will have many options of where to purchase the shirt. The image that January has on was shows the lettering backwards, however.\nIt's hard to tell, but she must have been standing before a mirror to get the shot.\nWho knew that January Jones was a fan of Erika Jayne? There are other celebrities who are fans of Erika's. In season 7 of the show, Dorit Kemsley's husband, Paul Kemsley, told Erika that Boy George liked her work. It made Erika's day to hear that a major pop icon was even aware of who she was. Since Erika has joined \"rhobh,\" her star has shined even brighter in the music and entertainment industry.\nFans got a chance to learn more about her glam squad and behind-the-scenes life on the show, which has given her more worldwide fame.\n\"RHOBH\" has also opened many doors for Erika Jayne in the two seasons that she's been a full-time cast member on the show. She was in the spring 2017 season of \"Dancing with the Stars\" and has made several appearances on \"The Young and the Restless.\" Former \"Real Housewives\" cast member, Eileen Davidson, gifted Erika with a script to be on the show for her 45th birthday celebration.\nWhat do you think if January Jones wearing a t-shirt showing that she's a fan of Erika Jayne? It hardly seems like the kind of thing Betty Draper would've dared to wear, but January is far more carefree than the reserved and uppity housewife of a successful advertising executive.\n\"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" season 8 will premiere later this fall on Bravo.<|endoftext|>We have turned the boring white/beige/gray standard toggle light switch wall plate to this beautiful art, printing this cute Autumn Lake and Swans design in high quality to make your wall plate special.

In 1991, the Monroe County Board of Commissioners ratified the Monroe County Year 2010 Comprehensive Plan (the Plan) and revised it in 1993 following several legal challenges. Ongoing legal proceedings prompted a 1995 Final Order and Recommendation by the Hearing Officer resulting in further revisions and final adoption of the Plan in 1996. During the final revision of the Plan, a \"carrying capacity approach\" to growth management was adopted, known as the Florida Keys Carrying Capacity Study (FKCCS). The FKCCS is designed to help determine the ability of the Florida Keys ecosystem, and the various segments thereof, to withstand all impacts of additional land development activities.\nThe SFRPC is assisting the DCA in a series of discussions focused around the FKCCS and its implementation and incorporation into the planning processes of Monroe County's local governments. The SFRPC is providing logistical support, assistance in process and meeting design, agenda development, facilitation, and in developing policies and strategies for the implementation of the FKCCS.\nThe FKCCS has two computer-based components, the Florida Keys Carrying Capacity Impact/Analysis Assessment Model (CCIAM) and the Routine Planning Tool (RPT). The CCIAM and RPT were developed to help understand the impact of additional development in the Florida Keys and to plan the future of Monroe County. The SFRPC is committed to housing, maintaining and running simulations on the model as well as making the RPT available to the public.\nThe RPT is now available on a trial basis while undergoing testing.

So, when you\u2019re thinking of introducing a second pet into your life, how do you go about making the process as straightforward as possible?\nIt seems it is entirely possible to teach an old dog new tricks, but only on his terms. We take a look at integrating a pup into your home while reassuring your existing pet that his position in the hierarchy remains unchanged.\nIn an ideal world your dog would welcome his new housemate in a gentle, nurturing way, with paws open. But unfortunately, the reality can be very different. While it\u2019s unlikely your dog would ever hurt a new pub, a warning growl or gentle cuff to the head might be behaviour you\u2019ll notice him exhibiting.\nYour dog has been there and done that when it comes to puppy play. He\u2019s explored his boundaries, learnt the rules and knows how the system works. As such, he has little interest in learning it all again and is unlikely to be interested in joining in the fun and games with this latest arrival. He\u2019ll also want to demonstrate very clearly where the youngster lands in the pecking order, so don\u2019t expect them to be playmates, at least not straight away.\nFor both old and new, can be very beneficial. When your dog seems like he\u2019s having enough, lead him to his bed and give him a treat. You\u2019ll be reinforcing the message that it\u2019s fine for him to have some time to himself. Naturally, you\u2019ll want to keep the smaller one away from him so you might even find a puppy play den is a useful way of separating them both in the short term.\nTo get your puppy up to speed quickly, you\u2019ll want to start training them early on. As they\u2019re young you\u2019ll want to go down the route of positive reinforcement rather than punishment so use a clicker method and treat to get them used to the idea that obedience reaps rewards. Make sure your pup is fully healthy before you start and has had any injections and a trip to the Dog wormers if necessary.\nYour adult dog may have had all the training he needs but there\u2019s still room to learn and grow so look for opportunities to reward any positive interactions they have with the puppy. If he doesn\u2019t snarl at him when he comes over for a sniff, reward your dog. If he lets him lie down next to him without growling, reward him. Anything that encourages a positive relationship between the two will lead to a more harmonious relationship.\nIt might seem that your dog will never get used to having a new housemate but over time this will change. In the meantime, you will need to be extra vigilant whenever they are around each other and separate when necessary. Your older dog\u2019s patience may wear thin pretty quickly and it\u2019s unlikely that your puppy will be able to read the warnings signs or at least translate what they mean.\nAgain, avoid punishment but make it clear that biting or aggressive behaviour is not tolerated from either side.\nYour dog has been a loyal and trusted friend and it\u2019s only right that they\u2019re given enough time to settle in with the new addition to the family. Eventually they will come to, if not love then tolerate the new family member.\nGive your dog the option of a time out and reward them for making that decision. Alongside that, start training your puppy on the house rules and help him get the hang of who\u2019s who"

        "passage": ".2km hike up the central Gogyeon gorge trail from the main carpark, passing the Gyeonam-pokpo falls en-route. The temple was established in 667 by the great Silla monk and philosopher, Wonhyo-daesa, who gave it the name Gogyeon-sa (\"temple seen in the past\") as he believed he had been here in a former life.\nIt has been an abode for the three famous monks Suneung, Ijeong, and Huirang, as well as being a place where Choi Chi-won, one of the great travelling Silla scholars, stayed.\nThe temple is home to Gogyeon-sa Stone Buddha, a large, fairly eroded seated buddha from the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392), an excellent metre high bronze bell, considered a masterwork of the 17th century artisan-monk Seolbong, and a giant, healthy Gingko tree at its entrance, said to be over 1000 years old.\nThe trail from Gogyeon-sa leaves from the back left of the temple, and it's a steep 800m hike north to the high ridge below Uiseong-bong. About halfway up to the ridge you'll encounter a massive bronze seated Buddha to the left of the trail in a rocky grotto.\nOur path meets the Janggun-bong-Udu-san trail in a high pass at the western foot of Uiseong-bong (1032m), a rocky tooth rising sharply from the ridge.\nTurning east the trail circles around the northern face of Uiseong-bong, bypassing it into it's eastern pass before climbing on toward Udu-san.\nThere is the option of climbing Uiseong-bong from its eastern side. A trail leaves the ridge heading west up Uiseong-bong a couple hundred metres to its summit, up an impressive case of a couple hundred stairs.\nIt's a worthy detour, Uiseong-bong is a great vantage point, with better views to the west and south down the valley than from Udu-san.\nFrom the base of Uiseong-bong it's only a 400m walk to Udu-san. From the eastern pass the trail climbs north-east up toothy ridge to a minor peak before turning more east for the final, quite steep climb to the summit.\nAbove: Udu-san (left) looking north-east along the Sudo-jimaek ridge toward Gaya-san, seen rising in the distance, and the south-eastern view from the summit (right), along the continuation of the Sudo-jimaek ridgeline to Bigye-san.\nFrom the summit our circuit heads south-east off the mountain, and soon drops into low forest which blankets the ridge to Bigye-san. It's a 2km walk to the pass of Majang-jae, which lies midway between Udu-san and the ridge junction to Bigye-san. The trail to the pass sticks to the line of the ridge, and there is an earlier option of heading down to the carpark 700m after leaving Udu-san.\nThe trail from Majang-jae heads south west down a steep gorge, 1.6km to the Gogyeon-sa entrance, passing Yongso-pokpo waterfall on the way.\nFor those who want to push further south east along the ridge, the trail heads a further 1.9km before reaching a rocky peak where a ridge shoulder rising from Gajo-myeon meets the Sudo-jimaek. A 3km trail runs southwest down this shoulder, ending up on the Gogyeon-sa - Gajo road to the northeast of town.\nThe ridge trail heads east from here, 800m to the summit of Bigye-san. A few hundred metres before reachng the peak a track heads south off the ridge 2km down to the Geochang/Gaso Hyugeso (rest area) on Expressway 12, about 4km west of town. This track passes through the mountain temple of Ilgak-sa - which I'd like to check out sometime, considering the Amaterasu legend - I believe its name means Sun-shrine-temple.\nBy Road: Expressway 12 (88 Olympic Expressway) running between Gwangju and Daegu has an exit at Gajo, between the exits of Geochang to the west and Haein-sa to the east. Getting off the expressway get on provincial road 1099 heading a short distance into the small town of Gajo, on the edge of town signs will direct you north-west across the plain about 3km to Udu-san, as shown in the photos at top.\nBy Bus: From Geochang Intercity Bus Terminal, regular city buses run to Gajo-myeon. They do not continue the 3km up to the temple carpark, you'll have to taxi to Gogyeon-sa, or stroll through the Higher Celestial Plain.\nGetting to Geochang: Buses to Geochang run from Dong-Seoul and Nambu terminals in Seoul. Also from Daejeon, Incheon, Gimcheon, Daegu, Gwangju, Busan and most cities in Gyeongsangnam-do.<|endoftext|>This website uses cookies which can be used to develop the site to become more user-friendly.

In fact, the National Safety Council gave the Lone Star State an \u2018F\u2019 grade in its 2018 State of Safety report when it came to workplace safety.\nRegardless your occupation or industry, if you sustained a work-related injury or illness due to unsafe work conditions, you may be entitled to compensation from your employer or through workers\u2019 compensation. But proving unsafe work conditions can be an extremely difficult and lengthy process, which is why you need the best possible lawyer.\nA former prosecutor, Morgan is experienced in all types of injury claims stemming from unsafe work conditions. His strong track record of verdicts and favorable settlements continually demonstrate his status as one of Texas\u2019 leading work-related accident lawyers. Unsafe work conditions exist in every business and workplace, and Morgan knows that no two work-related accidents are identical. That\u2019s why he collaborates with experts to reconstruct accident scenes, collect evidence and clearly explain to juries and judges how unsafe conditions caused your injury.\nWorkers injured due to unsafe conditions are usually entitled to compensation for their pain, suffering and medical costs. However, employers and insurance companies will regularly challenge who was at fault and often minimize the seriousness of your injury in an effort to reduce the compensation payment you deserve.\nYou need an experienced accident lawyer who specializes in unsafe work conditions to negotiate with the insurance companies, investigate the cause of the incident, obtain videos, identify witnesses, prove who was at fault and properly evaluate and present your injuries to ensure you receive maximum compensation.\nIf you or a loved one has been injured or killed due to unsafe work conditions, you need a protector and a fighter.

Jail is also an option.\n\nThe point system needs to change to reflect the context of speeding. 20km/h over the limit on our quiet motorway system outside of Dublin shouldn't attract the same as doing 70km/h through residential streets. Probably the main reason Im skeptical of Ross' plans which I think are to grab headlines.\n\nSpeeding in urban areas should definitely warrant a sterner penalty than on motorways though even if it just reduces the amount of complete assholes that tailgate you when you stick to the 50 limit.\n\nLets hope Ross also follows through with the plans to introduce the option to attend Road Safety Class instead of points for a first offence at least.<|endoftext|>We are excited to have been able to invest in a fantastic ESOL fogging machine.\n\u2018\u2019ESOL\u2122 is a unique and accessible sanitisation solution, which not only protects from microbes, but also respects the need for a safe application, both for people and nature.\nThe existing methods of sanitisation often pose significant threats to our health and harm the environment.

Founded in 1924 Geochang Yugi is now in its fourth generation of dedicated craft production.

Now I have a B+ in feature writing, a B in graphic novels (she's a TOUGH grader on papers), and an A in upper division American studies Theory.\n... the sun is starting to rise.\nBack from Arizona. Great trip. Hiked in the snow to Native American ruins, toured caverns, walked around Tombstone while it was lightly snowing, and drove out to the middle of the desert to watch a meteor shower.\nI'm doing a convention next weekend with Stitch and other friends. Then the weekend after is another road trip to see Brandon's dad before I have to start classes and my internship.\nMy final grades have finally posted for the semester. I worked my ass off writing papers and studying and came out with three As and two Bs. Woot.\nStitch gave me his spare pass for Anime L.A., so I'm there through tomorrow. I went yesterday. It's pretty much a cosplay con.\nThis is probably the coolest pic I took yesterday. Unfortunately it was night time and the Scott Pilgrim's sword soaked up ALL the light, so this photo went through some HEAVY editing.\nI'm in San Francisco, writing this from my hostel room just before we check out and hang around the city before heading down to Bakersfield to spend the rest of the trip with my boyfriend's dad.\nIt's been a fascinating trip thus far.

Changdeokgung is also known as the East Palace because its location east of Gyeongbok Palace. The literal meaning of Changdeokgung is \"Palace of Prospering Virtue.\"\nThe Changdeokgung palace was built between Peak Maebong of Mt. Bugaksan in the back and Rivulte Geumcheon having flowing in the front influenced by the principle \"baesanimsu\" in Feng Shui theory. Contrary to Gyeongbokgung whose main buildings are arranged in accurate architectural principle, however, buildings in Changdeokgung are disposed more freely without a regular system. Though its structure seems chaotic at a glace, all buildings are in harmony with the environment surrounding them.\nChangdeokgung was the favorite palace of many kings of the Joeseon Dynasty and still retains many Korean architectural elements dating from the Three Kingdoms of Korea period (1200-1300s). These elements differed from the then-popular and more formal style of times, as seen at Gyeongbokgung (Gyeongbok Palace). One major difference is that the buildings of Changdeokgung blend with the scenery of the area, vice contrasting like the palace at the Forbidden City in China.\nConstruction of Changdeok Palace began in 1405, was completed in 1412, and spanned 110 acres. The Palace was burned down during the Japanese invasion in 1592 and later reconstructed in 1609. Changdeokgung was the site of the royal court and the government until 1872, when the neighboring Gyeongbok Palace was rebuilt. Today, there are 13 buildings remaining on the palace grounds and 28 pavilions in the gardens.\nThe Changdeok Palace was burnt to the ground during the Japanese invasion in 1592 and reconstructed in 1609 by King Seonjo and King Gwanghaegun. The next arson was in 1623 because of King Injo Political Revolt against Gwanghaegun. The palace was also attacked by the Manchu Qing but throughout its history of reconstruction and repair has remained faithful to its original design. Changdeokgung was the site of the royal court and the seat of government until 1872, when the neighboring Gyeongbokgung was rebuilt. Korea's last Emperor, Emperor Sunjong lived here until his death in 1926.\nThe Gayasan National Park which is also known as Kayasan Mountain National park is one of the most notable national parks in South Korea. It was established in the year 1966 and covers about 80000 square kilometres. There are plenty of places in South Korea that are untouched by even the Korean inhabitants and still remain one of the tourist spots. Jirisan National Park is one of a kind. The South Korean Tourism Adventure, Tracking, Hacking and Climbing has taken urgent steps to promote these national parks.\nThe Gayasan National Park Located in the deep inlands of south Korea, Gayasan was designated as the 9th national park in Korea in 1972. Gayasan was well-known as one of the 10 most beautiful spots in the East Sea area and as one of the eight scenic wonders of the Joseon dynasty. The total area of the park is 77Km it borders hapcheon-gun and Geochang-gun of Gyeongsangnam-do, and Seongju-gun of Gyeongsangbuk do.
