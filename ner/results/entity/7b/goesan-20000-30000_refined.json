        "passage": "Temozolomide (TMZ) is an alkylating agent commonly used as a first\u2011line treatment for high\u2011grade glioblastoma. However, TMZ has short half\u2011life and frequently induces tumor resistance, which can limit its therapeutic efficiency. In the present study, it was hypothesized that combined treatment with TMZ and acteoside has synergistic effects in glioblastoma therapy. Using cell viability and wound\u2011healing assays, it was determined that this treatment regimen reduced cell viability and migration to a greater extent than either TMZ or acteoside alone. Following previous reports that TMZ affected autophagy in glioma cells, the present study examined the effects of TMZ + acteoside combination treatment on apoptosis and autophagy. The TMZ + acteoside combination treatment increased the cleavage of caspase\u20113 and levels of B\u2011cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl\u20112)\u2011associated X protein and phosphorylated p53, and decreased the level of Bcl\u20112. The combination treatment increased microtubule\u2011associated protein 1 light chain 3 and apoptosis\u2011related gene expression. It was also determined that TMZ + acteoside induced apoptosis and autophagy through the mitogen\u2011activated protein kinase signaling pathway. These findings suggest that acteoside has beneficial effects on TMZ\u2011based glioblastoma therapy.\nGlioblastoma is the most common type of malignant primary brain tumor and the most invasive and devastating primary brain tumor (1,2), with a median survival rate of ~18 months with aggressive multimodality therapy. Current treatment decisions are limited and include radiation, chemotherapy and surgery in combination with the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) (3,4). Despite the availability of aggressive therapies, patients with glioblastoma generally have a poor prognosis (5). TMZ is the major chemotherapeutic drug used in the clinical treatment of malignant glioblastoma (6-8); as an alkylating agent in the imidazotetrazine series, it is able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (9-11). During malignant glioblastoma progression and extensive invasion throughout the brain, steadily increasing drug resistance to TMZ decreases its therapeutic efficacy (12,13). Accordingly, novel therapeutic drugs to counter glioblastoma are urgently sought.\nPrevious studies have reported that glioma cells undergo cell death via autophagy, or type II programmed cell death, in response to TMZ (14,15). Autophagy can be inhibited by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) through the conversion of micro-tubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-I to LC3-II, thus reducing glioblastoma cell death (16,17); however, the role of autophagy is dependent on the cellular context. With the exception of a cytotoxic role during TMZ action, the induction of autophagy by cellular stress is a cytoprotective process that eliminates stress-induced cytoplasmic aggregates, organelles and macromolecules in mammalian cells through the lysosomal system. In turn, cells involved in maintaining homeostasis receive energy through these catabolic processes (18,19). The complex roles of autophagy suggest that an autophagy activator may have anticancer effects in combination with TMZ treatment by inducing glioblastoma cell autophagy without exerting deleterious effects or providing benefits to normal tissues. Of note, TMZ has exhibited synergistic therapeutic effects in combination with vitamin D, including suppressed cell viability and enhanced autophagy in glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, the combination of TMZ and vitamin D has been shown to exert anticancer effects in vivo, including reduced tumor size and prolonged survival rate. These studies suggest that combination treatment may have synergistic anticancer effects via autophagic mechanisms in TMZ-based glioblastoma therapy (15).\nActeoside is a phenylethanoid glycoside that is widely distributed in several tonified traditional Chinese herbal medicines (20,21). A number of pharmacological actions, including antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antinephritic and antimetastatic actions, have been associated with acteoside (22-24). Previous studies have demonstrated that acteoside has protective effects against carbon tetrachloride- and D-galactosamine-induced liver injury. The mechanisms underlying the protective effects of acteoside are likely related to its capacity to inhibit P450-mediated bioactivation and free radical scavenging effects induced by carbon tetrachloride exposure (25,26).\nTherefore, evidence suggests that both acteoside and TMZ induce anticancer effects through cell death. However, their association and anticancer effects in the context of glioblastoma remain to be elucidated. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to verify the synergistic anticancer effects of acteoside combined with TMZ in glioblastoma therapy. A cell viability assay was performed to analyze the anticancer effects of the combination treatment in C6 glioblastoma cells (a rat glioblastoma cell line), and the results were compared with those following treatment with TMZ alone. To further examine the mechanism of cell death caused by cotreatment with acteoside and TMZ, apoptosis- and autophagy-related genes in C6 cells were examined.\nThe C6 rat glioblastoma cell line was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA). The cells were cultured under sterile conditions at 37\u00b0C in a humid environment with 5% of CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1% antibiotics and antimycotics (all Welgene, Daegu, Korea).\nAbeliophyllum distichum Nakai [voucher no. Park1001(ANH)] was collected in Misunhyang Theme park, Seongbul-Mountain Recreation Forest, 78, Chungmin-rogigok-gil, Goesan-eup, Goesan-gun, Chungcheongbuk-do, Korea.\nTo induce callus formation (27), 1-cm2 leaf explants were isolated from the fresh plants. The explant was cultured on Murachige and Skoog medium (4% sucrose, 0.9% agar supplemented with 1 mg/l naphthalene acetic acid and 1 mg/l 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, pH 5.7) at 25\u00b0C. The callus was induced 20 days later. A sufficient quantity of acteoside was obtained through subculture to separate and purify acteoside from the callus (Fig. 1). Different batches of purified acteoside were used in each experiment. Each experiment was performed three times using a different batch.\nThe ethylacetate fractions were concentrated in vacuo and used as a sample for the purification of acteoside. Acteoside was isolated and purified by the Accelerated Chromatographic Isolation system (Isolera\u2122 Spektra, Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden) using SNAP KPHOSPHO-SIL and SNAP Ultra Cartridges (Biotage). The acteoside purified from the callus was quantitatively analyzed using the standard acteoside by HPLC-PDA analysis. Finally, acteoside of \u226595% purity was obtained from the callus and used as a sample for chemotherapy of temozolomide-based glioblastoma.\nTo identify the TMZ half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 value) against C6 cells, 1\u00d7104 cells in single cell suspensions were seeded into individual wells of 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C prior to TMZ treatment at the indicated concentrations (1, 5, 10, and 20 mM) at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. Following determination of the TMZ IC50 value as 5 mM, the cells were treated for 24 h with 5 mM TMZ, 50 \u00b5M acteoside, or a combination of the two (5 mM TMZ<|endoftext|>"

The network infrastructure of existing core networks is currently undergoing atransformation from rings using SONET Add/Drop Multiplexers (ADMs) to mesh topologiesusing Optical Cross-connects (OXCs). A core optical network architecture can be opaque ortransparent. An opaque architecture means that the optical signal carrying traffic undergoesan Optical to Electronic to Optical (OEO) conversion at different places in the network. Atransparent architecture means that the optical signal carrying traffic stays in the opticaldomain from the time it is generated at the edge of the network until it leaves the network.Even though the applications driving thelarge scaledeployment of transparent optical switches are notcurrently in place (niche applications in today\u2019s networks onlyuse a very small number of transparent switches), and the trafficdemand does notcurrently justify theuse of transparentswitches that are cost effective at very high bit rates,it is possible that atsome point in the futuretransparent switches may be deployed in the network. Based on thisassumption, this paper explores the technology issues and challenges that are associated with3D MEMS-based switch fabrics.

The air carried the unmistakable scent of the fiery spice.\nFarmers\u2019 booths nearby had loads of freshly harvested, sun-dried red chilies, ready to be ground into gochu-garu -- chili powder -- or to be aged into thick, fermented chili paste, gochujang.\nThe Aug. 27-29 Yeongyang H.O.T. Festival led to on-the-spot sales and delivery orders for chilies and related farm products totaling nearly 2 billion won ($1.7 million), organizers said.\nFrom mid-August to this week, three more such events were held in rural towns famous for their chilies: Eomseong, Goesan and Cheongyang.\nSouth Korea is in its peak season for red hot chili peppers. In late summer and early fall, the pungent spice, which provides the basis for the heat and color of many Korean dishes, arrives at the market in its best form and in abundance.\nKang Gyeong-sook, a 60-something housewife, visited Seoul Plaza to bulk purchase the peppers.\n\u201cChili is the most important spice.\u201d she said without hesitation.\nWhat she had in mind was the approaching gimjang -- the kimchi-making season in early winter, when families prepare a large quantity of the pickled cabbage dish for consumption throughout the year.\n\u201cDuring the gimjang season, chili prices go up,\u201d Kang\u2019s friend chimed in. They were each looking to buy at least 12 kilograms of dried chilies, or 20 geun in the traditional Korean unit of weight.\nKorea\u2019s per-capita chili consumption stood at around 3 kilograms in 2017, down from 3.7 kilograms in 2013. That is about 8 grams of chilies per day. It is the most consumed vegetable here.\nThe small, fiery fruit is now such an integral part of Korean cuisine that even toddlers have their daily fix of kimchi -- though it could be a milder version -- even before they learn how to use chopsticks.\nHowever, it was only in the postwar era that Koreans began to develop such a deep fondness for the spice.\nChilies are believed to have first arrived here in the 16th century and were widely cultivated in the 18th century. But until the 1950s, they did not have such a big presence on Korean dining tables.\nAccording to Ahn Jung-youn, a researcher at the National Folk Museum of Korea, the stress of postwar society sparked the popularity of chilies.\n\u201cThe Korean War and the years that followed were no doubt a time of extreme difficulties. \u2026 There is a link between a society\u2019s stress level and the yearning for spicy food,\u201d she said.\nAs the nation recovered from the war and rebuilt its economy at an unprecedented speed,<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Dr Mahesh Chander narrates his unique experience from participating in the IFOAM Organic Leadership Course Master Class-2017, which was the follow-up of the Organic Leadership Course he attended in 2012.\nFederation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM), initiated Organic Leadership Course (OLC) in 2012. I was one among the 15 participants selected for the first OLC-South Asia Course of 10 month duration, with online and two residential modules of 10 days (Near Mumbai, Maharashtra, April, 2012) and 7 days (http://www.ifoam.bio/en/olcsouth-asia-2012 ) in Bangalore (November, 2012). As a part of this training, each one of us created Development Plans (DPs) to be pursued after completion of the course.\nFrom the 60 applications they received, 24 participants from 18 countries were selected for a 6 days training at Goesan, South Korea, during 24-29 April, 2017. Well in advance, the IFOAM Academy published a document describing the profile of the course participants, indicating their achievements in context of their DPs (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0TX5SvS4lMRVUx3ZkVLaUpod2s/view. Also, well before the start of the current course, the programme schedule was mailed to all the participants (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0TX5SvS4lMRblN1cDF5Vmd6ZXM/view.\nThe Honorable Deputy Governor of the Goesan province, addressed the participants, who were introduced to him by the course Director. The inauguration activity was crisp and finished as per schedule within 30 minutes.\nWell planned technical sessions were mostly group exercises with presentation by the course participants, wherein, presentation methods like world caf\u00e9, open space, fish bowl, cards, charts, etc., were used. These sessions were interactive and participatory, enabling everyone to contribute to the discussions, thus making the methodology used, a good, participatory experience.\nproduce products believing human and nature as well as the urban and rural areas are connected in the string of life. The consumers buy the products, relating to this thought of the producers. It is a good concept worth replicating in other developing countries, though it has its own set of issues. We also visited an organic farm by name 10 Farmers, which was diverse in its produce and had its own retail store to sell its farm produce.\nThe course participants continue to send their free and frank feedback on the course, which is highly appreciative. The constructive criticism of the course (Box 1), in fact, may be used by the IFOAM Academy to improve this course in the future. Many participants including myself felt the duration of the course could have been a little longer, maybe 10 days. The course director assured that the feedback will be analyzed and a general reflection on this course would be shared in coming days. The participants were also interested to have more interactions with organic farmers there and listen to their practical experiences to contrast the experiences with the farmers back home. Maybe the time constraint did not allow this, nevertheless, many of us felt the need for it.\nMy expectation was, as master class alumni, we should have come up with at least an organic leadership output that can be country/region specific, based on the organic leadership course, our DPs and experiences \u2013 for scaling up. For example, it could be an organic leadership training design that would be appropriate for the agriculture policy makers or for organic practitioners and/or for agricultural extension workers. In this way, there will be a training guide developed by a pool of experts on how to train future organic leaders in their respective areas. It will also be a good attachment for proposal on organic training funding. I hope this will be taken into consideration as one idea on future master class.\nProgram/ workshop topics may be reconsidered, clear statement before outset or at start of class on expectations and outcomes from the course \u2013 in collaboration with participants, excursions built in earlier in the program. These were really excellent and well chosen (Hansalim, 10 Farmers etc), and they gave great insight into organic agriculture, direct selling and consumer organization. Development Plan tactic \u2013 further development plan for each participant perhaps? Longer course could be considered, for various reasons (including jetlag?)as we took time to start interacting as a group, group exercises / icebreakers at the start, to develop trust and ideas between members, we went immediately into output mode. Topic suggestions: Participate in discussions about the future of organic agriculture e.g., Vision development or envision, the future of organic; fuller examination of Organic 3.0 and concepts and how and what to implement; suggestions on how to improve organic agriculture and take-up in each Participant\u2019s local context; selecting success stories/ identifying elements that might work in the participants\u2019 local context, and replicating and scaling organic agriculture success stories.\nWhile we are slowly receiving everyone\u2019s feedback, do we also try and find a way \u2013 collectively (but virtually), to envision and create a \u201cwhere do we go from here\u201d plan? I remember we didn\u2019t quite formulate one or didn\u2019t reach a consensus. That, or we just let it be? \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019ve been going over my notes and the common theme has been: local, empowerment, communicating to the grassroots/farmers/smallholders, cultural shifts and a more enabling environment versus regulation. Let me know what everyone thinks, and if you all want to move this forward with a commitment to a project/initiative or if we just let it be.\nI enjoyed OLC a lot; agree with most of your comments. Personally, I think it was a pity we did not have more time to present success stories of our work in more detail. People can always share the best topics they are really into, frontal talks maybe old-fashioned but input can be very good.\nI would have liked to discuss and examine more of the Organic 3 as mentioned by Tracy and Ailbhe. This will be on another occasion and probably at Organic World Congress 2017 in India. I agree with Ailbhe, that we should have discussed on how to improve organic agriculture in each participant\u2019s local context. As Mahesh said, the value chain and group / cooperative farming approach being done by Hansalim, is an excellent model to follow in our countries. Finally, David\u2019s idea for the creation of an OLC Alumni Network is a priority to take advantage of international expertise in the organic field. From my part, I suggest the creation of a platform reserved for distance learning courses with discussion forums. These courses could deal with very specific aspects such as composting, organic intensification, organic innovations, etc.\nThe Course Director responded to the feed- back and gave his equally frank reflection on the course (Box2).\nWhile applying to the course, the prospective participants were asked to submit a motivation letter, as to why they want to participate in this course? On completion of the course, in their feedback, they have mentioned whether their expectations from the course were met or not. The course participants took a keen interest in giving their constructive feedback with an intent to see similar programmes being organized in a better way.\nThe programme focused on technical content, presentations, and learning and sharing from the experiences of diverse set of participants in a participatory mode. It\u2019s a good practice worth replicating in training programmes that are organized. The inaugural session was so brief and took only 30 minutes, which helped by providing adequate time for other more relevant sessions.\nProfessional way of handling the programme, the logistics, catering, accommodation, transport etc., were outstanding. These lessons could be useful to make training programmes organized by us more impactful.\nThere were a lot of positive outcomes, especially the opportunity to<|endoftext|>"

Adopted at three years old in 1984 by loving parents, Kara was mostly disinterested in finding her birth family. But when Kara became a mother and her daughter approached the same age as when she was abandoned, Kara couldn\u2019t understand why her mother would give her up. Kara began an intense search to find her parents.\nKara researched adoptee forums on Facebook, adoptee rights organizations, and online genealogy platforms. She took DNA tests through Family Tree DNA, then uploaded the results to MyHeritage.

However, Kara was met with resistance to reaching her father by her nephew\u2019s mother and aunts (her presumed half-sisters), and Kara filed a lawsuit which resulted in a court-ordered paternity test.\nKara briefly met her father on his apartment doorstep, who brushed her aside and has had no further contact.

In 2008 and 2009, the cultivars were tested for resistance to the Pc003 isolate collected in Youngyang, Gyeongbuk province. In 2010, the selected cultivars in the previous years were tested by inoculating with 3 isolates obtained from the pepper plants in Miryang in Gyeongnam province, Youngyang in Gyeongbuk province, and Goesan in Chungbuk province. A continuous variation in resistance from highly resistant to susceptible was observed among the commercial pepper cultivars. It was also noted that some cultivars, although their names were initiating with ``Yeokgang`` or ``PR`` meaning Phytophthora resistance, were very low in resistance or susceptible. When the resistant cultivars selected in 2008 and 2009 experiment were inoculated with the 3 isolates, all the commercial cultivars except a rootstock, ``Tantan``, succumbed to the exceptionally virulent Pc005 (Miryang) isolate. Pc002 (Goesan) was a little more virulent than Pc003 (Youngyang). A few cultivars resistant to Pc003 (Youngyang) were severely infected by Pc002 (Goesan). Significant interaction in analysis of variance suggested the differential interactions between cultivars and pathogen isolates.

That said, noraebang makes for an excellent party space or just a fun place to chill and hang out.\nJulia and I got \"\ud1a0\ub124\uc774\ub3c4\" (Tornado) desserts at Lotteria!\nMy first experience with a karaoke room was in Taiwan (where it's called \u5361\u62c9-OK), but the selection of English songs was paltry.

It was a couple of weeks into Orientation before I finally had the time and energy to spend a night out. It was the night after our placement ceremony, and I wanted to celebrate. My friends and I went into town (tiny little Goesan...) and hit up the Lotteria first. Lotteria is like the Korean version of McDonald's. I really wanted to try a \"\ud1a0\ub124\uc774\ub3c4\" (Tornado), which is like a McFlurry but much, much smaller. In fact, serving sizes of everything in Lotteria were rather meager.

Effective lifetime of excited vibrational band instead of single rotational level, is used in the LIF model. And this is normally correct if RET process is fast, but still need to check if concentrations of quenching species such as H 2 O to OH is very high [54,[68][69][70]. Furthermore, the laser power needs to be kept low and linear LIF is achieved to avoid stimulated emission and large depletion of initial pumped state density.\nIn many cases the excitation radiations locate range of deep UV (e.g., <100 nm) and are strongly absorbed by ambient gaseous medium (e.g., air or water molecules), then two-photon excitation in the UV spectral range (>200 nm) can be applied for the same diagnostic purpose, namely the so-called two-photon absorption LIF (TA-LIF) [49]. Compared to single-photon LIF, TA-LIF is considerably less efficient and the excitation rate scales with the square of laser power. Normally higher laser power is required to produce detectable fluorescence intensity, but laser stimulated effects including photon-ionization, induced breakdown, stimulated emission, etc. needs to be avoided [71,72]. Table 3 lists excitation schemes of TA-LIF for various active atomic species in plasmas. An example of twodimensional distribution of atomic oxygen in an atmospheric-pressure plasma jet-source by TA-LIF is presented in Figure 4.\n\nAbsorption spectroscopy\nAnother important diagnostic technique for atmospheric-pressure plasmas is absorption spectroscopy (AS) [77]. Compared to LIF or OES approaches, AS is an in\n\nSpecies\nExcitation transition Fluorescence transition Calibration Ref.\nRayleigh of air [50][51][52][53][54] NO NO gas [55][56][57][58][59] Rayleigh [65,66]   situ and non-invasive technique probing absolute densities of interested species without need of extra calibration and independent on collisional quenching process. It relies on the Beer-Lambert law: where I s is the light intensity passing through sample, I 0 is the incident radiation, N is species density, \u03c3\u03bb \u00f0\u00deis the wavelength dependent absorption cross-section, and L is the absorption path-length. If probed species density is low, the absorption length is normally increased by using a multi-pass spectroscopic absorption cell where light reflects between two mirrors, e.g., the Herriott cell [78]. However, if for micro-plasmas this technique maybe not sensitive enough if species density is not high to obtain a distinct absorbance signal.\nThe sensitivity of absorption measurements is strongly dependent on the stability of used light source. Various types of light sources, narrow-band or broadband with wavelength range from VUV to mid-infrared, are applied together with high spectral resolution detection system such as spectrometer or FTIR. AS by laser light sources, particularly tunable diode-lasers or quantum cascade lasers are attractive light sources have been applied to measure species densities in micro-plasmas [8, 79,80]. These laser sources output specific wavelengths of large absorption cross-sections and enable fine scan of wavelength to obtain a clear absorption line profile, and from which species density and even gas temperature are able to be derived.\nWavelength selectivity is important in the implementation of AS technique as absorption may overlap by multi-species. And, it should be mentioned that absorption measurements yield line-integrated densities and spatial distribution is achievable by Abel inversion. Special efforts are required for non-uniform micro-plasmas by AS approach, since gas temperature and species density are spatially dependent. In this case broadband absorption can provide more details for deriving both the gas temperature and species density [81,82]. An example of OH density determination by broadband UV absorption in an atmospheric-pressure pin-to-water discharge is depicted in Figure 5 [83].\nAnother quite sensitive approach by using a cavity of two highly reflective mirrors is the cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) [84]. The laser pulse goesand-back in the cavity and that effectively enhances the absorption path length in the probed gas sample by several orders of magnitude. The time-decay of light intensity leaking from the cavity depends on the reflectivity of mirrors and species density in the cavity. Based on that the species density is able to be obtained with the known mirror reflectivity. In addition to the high sensitivity, compared to absorption spectroscopy, CRDS is independent on fluctuations of light intensity since a time constant rather than an absolute absorbance is measured. More details of CRDS technique are included in Refs. [84][85][86][87][88][89][90].\n\nSummary\nHigh-end diagnostic techniques have been applied to atmospheric-pressure plasmas. Even for highly transient non-uniform micro-plasmas, reliable insights of discharge properties are able to be achieved. This chapter includes several important advanced diagnostic approaches specifically for plasma parameters and reactive plasma species. Two approaches are suggested for a same diagnostic purpose, for example, the determination of gas temperature or electron density, and compared to ensure and increase the measurement accuracy, particularly for atmospheric-pressure plasmas. Other important plasma properties, such as densities of ion species and ion flux, surface charges, have been investigated as well and related diagnostic techniques can be found in above (review) references.

All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, unless otherwise specified.\nThe plant parts of A. distichum including flower, leaf and branch were collected at Jangyyeon-myeon Goesan-gun Korea. Five hundred grams of fresh parts was extracted with 1,000 mL of 80% methanol with shaking for 24 h. The methanol-soluble fraction was filtered and concentrated to approximately 20 mL volume using a vacuum evaporator and a fraction was placed in a separating funnel. The ethyl acetate fraction was separated from the mixture, evaporated by a vacuum evaporator and prepared aseptically and kept in a refrigerator until use.\nMouse macrophage cell line, RAW264.7 cells was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin. The cells were maintained 37\u2103 under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Ethyl acetate fraction from A. distichum (EAFAD) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and then treated to cells. DMSO was used as a vehicle and the final DMSO concentration was no exceeded 0.1% (v/v).\nRAW264.7 cells were plated in 12-well plate for overnight. Cells were pre-treated with the extracts at the indicated concentrations for 2 h and then co-treat with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for the additional 18 h. After 18 h, 200 \u03bcL of the media was mixed with equal amount of Griess reagent (1% sulfanilamide and 0.1% N-1-(naphthyl) ethylenediamine-diHCl in 2.5% H3PO4). The mixture was incubated for the additional 5 min at the room temperature and the absorbance was measured at 540 nm.\nTotal RNA was prepared using a RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and total RNA (1 \u03bcg) was reverse-transcribed using a Verso cDNA Kit (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol for cDNA synthesis. PCR was carried out using PCR Master Mix Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) with primers for mouse iNOS and mouse GAPDH as follows: mouse iNOS: forward 5\u2019-gtgctgcctctggtcttgcaagc-3\u2019, and reverse 5\u2019-agggg caggctgggaattcg-3\u2019, mouse GAPDH: forward 5\u2019-caggagcgag accccactaacat-3\u2019 and reverse 5\u2019-gtcagatccacgacggacacatt-3\u2019.\nNuclear and cytosolic fractions were prepared following the manufacturer's protocols of nuclear extract kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Briefly, RAW264.7 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS containing phosphatase inhibitors and harvested with 1xhypotonic buffer for 15 min at 4\u2103. After adding detergent, the cells were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min and then the supernatants were collected as cytoplasmic fraction. Nuclear fractions were collected by suspending nuclear pellet with lysis buffer and centrifugation.\nCells were washed with 1 \u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Boston Bio Products, Ashland, MA, USA) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma Aldrich) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma Aldrich), and centrifuged at 12,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4\u2103. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. The proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were blocked for non-specific binding with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1h at room temperature and then incubated with specific primary antibodies in 5% nonfat dry milk at 4\u2103 overnight. After three washes with TBS-T, the blots were incubated with horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated immunoglobulin G (IgG) for 1 h at room temperature and chemiluminescence was detected with ECL Western blotting substrate (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized in Polaroid film.\nTransient transfection was performed using PolyJet DNA transfection reagent (SignaGen Laboratories, Ijamsville, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Briefly, RAW264.7 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and incubated overnight. Then, plasmid mixtures containing 1 \u03bcg of pNF-\u03baB-Luc plasmid and 0.1 \u03bcg of pRL-null vector were transfected for 24 h. After transfection, cells were pre-treated with the extracts for 2 h and then co-treated with LPS for an additional 15 h. The cells were harvested in 1 x luciferase lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was measured and normalized to the pRL-null luciferase activity using a dual-luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).\nA statistical analysis was performed with the Student\u2019s unpaired t-test, with statistical significance set at * P < 0.05.\nUnder stimulation, macrophages-generated NO plays an important role in inflammatory response. Thus, we used the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 cells for evaluating anti-inflammatory effect of the part of A. distichum. To determine if the parts of A. distichum could reduce NO generation by LPS, RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with the extracts from the parts of A. distichum (EAFAD) for 2 h and then co-treated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for the additional 18 h. As shown in Fig. 1, treatment of LPS without EAFAD induced NO overproduction in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, while pretreatment of all EAFADs suppressed LPS-mediated NO overproduction. Among EAFADs, the inhibitory effect of NO production was highest in the treatment of EAFAD-L (extracts from the leaf of A. distichum). Thus, we chose EAFAD-L for further studies.\nFig. 1Effect of EAFAD on NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. RAW264.7 cells were pre-treated with EAFAD at the indicated concentrations for 2 h and then co-treated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for the additional 18 h. After treatment, NO production was measured using the media and Griess reagent. DMSO was used as a vehicle. Values given are the mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3). *p < 0.05 compared to LPS treatment without EAFAD. EAFAD-F, EAFAD-L and EAFAD-B means the ethyl acetate fraction from the flower (EAFAD-L), leaf (EAFAD-L) and branch (EAFAD-B) of A. distichum.\nSince NO production is regulated by iNOS expression, the effect of EAFAD-L on iNOS expression was evaluated by Western blot and RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1A, LPS overexpression was detected in the cells stimulated LPS alone. However, EAFAD-L inhibited iNOS expression in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. For the further study for evaluating whether inhibitory effect of EAFAD-L against the expression of iNOS protein is mediated from regulating iNOS transcription, we also determined the mRNA level of iNOS regulated by EAFAD-L in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, the treatment of EAFAD-L attenuated the mRNA expression of iNOS. These data indicates that EAFAD-L may reduce iNOS expression through suppressing iNOS transcription.\nFig. 2Effect of EAFAD-L on iNOS expression in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. For Western blot (A), cells were pre-treated with indicated concentrations of EAFAD-L for 2 h and then co-treated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for an additional 15 h. DMSO was used as a vehicle. Cell lysates (30 \u03bcg) were resolved by 10% SDS\u2013PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with antibodies against iNOS. The proteins were then visualized using ECL detection. \u03b2-actin was used as an internal control. For RT-PCR (B), cells were pre-treated with indicated concentrations of EAFAD-L for 2 h and then co-treated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for an additional 15 h. Total RNA was isolated and RT-PCR was performed for iNOS. GAPDH was used as an internal control for RT-PCR.\nTo elucidate the effect of EAFAD-L on NF-\u03baB activation, we firstly carried out a Western blot for I\u03baB-\u03b1 degradation in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, LPS induced I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation and subsequent I\u03baB-\u03b1 degradation at 15 min after the stimulation. However, pretreatment of EAFAD-L blocked LPS-induced I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation in a dose-dependent manner.\nFig. 3.Inhibitory effect of EAFAD-L against NF-\u03baB activation.

The jars of greens are then fermented at room temperature.\nMainly because they bear some similarities, kimchi is normally referred to as \u201changuo pao cai,\u201d which means \u201cKorean fermented vegetables,\u201d in China.\nThis isn\u2019t South Korea\u2019s first try at building \u201cxinqi\u201d the de facto Chinese identify for kimchi.\nIn 2013, the Ministry of Agriculture lobbied for a new name in reaction to the increasing amount of China-made kimchi products in overseas marketplaces, as very well as in South Korea\u2019s domestic industry.

See the article \"The Mission Workshop\" for more insight on how to teach with mission projects.\nIt's COOL to Care for Others During Hot Summer Months!\nAnd a thoughtful blog on Teaching Kids to Love. It is directed to parents, but has some great points that apply in the classroom, too.\n\"Let your neighbors know that you love them in appropriate ways (aka: don\u2019t be weird). No one likes to be thought of as a project, but everyone wants to be seen, known, loved, and respected. As you look for opportunities to demonstrate genuine and authentic love to others, model these moments for your children. Identify ways your family could show love and care to someone in a way that he or she would feel seen, known, and authentically loved.\"\nJesus Washes the Disciples Feet at the Last Supper--we put together foot care packages for the local homeless shelter (which was housed at our church on Friday nights).\nMore mission and service project ideas for children and families and churches can be found in this topic: Missions, Missionaries, Service projects, including many that would be appropriate for a Day of Service on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.\nHere is a great blog post from Laurie's Little Monkeys with some good suggestions for service projects that children can actually do (rather than collecting food, toys, whatever...).\nThere are suggestions for animals (have someone from the animal shelter visit church and talk about animal care, then make dog treats or toys -- great for a creation stewardship mission workshop), caring for shut-ins and people in hospitals, projects to recognize community helpers, and more.\nOur new Writing Team lesson set on the Good Samaritan includes a variety of suggested service and outreach projects. The Parable of the Good Samaritan is a story that calls for action. One of the objectives of this lesson set is for the students to be able to identify persons \"in need\" within the their world (their \"Jericho road\") and think of actions they could take to show compassion and mercy to that person.\nBecause churches have different opportunities for \"Samaritan activities\" in their communities, we have created a collection of outreach suggestions with creative ideas for conducting them that you can adapt to your resources and the needs of your community. Supporting Members can access this lesson here.\nChoose a service activity or project to use as a weekly mission workshop during your Good Samaritan rotation for each group to rotate to.\nSchedule one special Sunday for kids to get involved in being good Samaritans with the rest of the congregation. Check out the post from Beth Tobin for inspiration.\nEncourage each family to choose their own community service project and have them take pictures to share on your church's social media with a hashtag such as #OurChurchGoesAndDoesLikewise or #ProjectGoodSamaritan or #NationalDayofService (be sure to tag Rotation.org, too, so we can see what you are doing!).\nNot a Supporting Member?

        "passage": " of Ranunculaceae and contains approximately ten species (Erst et al. 2020). Phylogenetic relationships within this genus have been elucidated recently (Xiang et al. 2021)....\nFlowers are an innovative characteristic of angiosperms, and elaborate petals usually have highly specialized structures to adapt to different living environments and pollinators. Petals of Eranthis have complex bilabiate structures with nectaries and pseudonectaries; however, the diversity of the petal micromorphology and structure is unknown. Petal development, micromorphology, structure and ultrastructure in four Eranthis species were investigated under SEM, TEM and LM. The results show that petals undergo 5 developmental stages, and accessory structure formation (stage 4) mainly determines the diversity of final mature petal morphology and pseudonectaries; the central depression formed in stage 2 will develop into nectary tissues. Petals are bilabiate and have hidden nectaries in nectary grooves; they consist of one layer of rounded and raised secretory epidermal cells and 3\u201314 layers of secretory cells with abundant plasmodesmata between cells. A large number of sieve tubes are distributed between the cells and extend to the epidermis; in addition, the vessel elements are located below the secretory area. Nectar is stored in the intercellular space between secretory parenchyma cells and escapes through microchannels or cell rupture. Pseudonectaries in all species of Eranthis except for E. hyemalis consist of smooth, ornamented epidermal cells and 9\u201312 layers of parenchyma cells with sparse cytoplasm, which may have the function of attracting pollinators.\n... & A. Grey [3]. This genus consists of 10 to 13 early flowering herbaceous perennial species that are distributed across Southern Europe and Western, Central, and temperate Asia [4][5][6][7]. Species of this genus have rarely been the subject of phytochemical research. Examination of the literature indicates that triterpene glycosides and saponins have been studied (along with their biological activity) in E. cilicica Schott & Kotschy [8,9]....\nAqueous-ethanol extracts (70%) from the leaves of Eranthis longistipitata Regel. (Ranuncu-laceae Juss.)-collected from natural populations of Kyrgyzstan-were studied by liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). There was no variation of the metabolic profiles among plants that were collected from different populations. More than 160 compounds were found in the leaves, of which 72 were identified to the class level and 58 to the individual compound level. The class of flavonoids proved to be the most widely represented (19 compounds), including six aglycones [quercetin, kaempferol, aromadendrin, 6-methoxytaxifolin, phloretin, and (+)-catechin] and mono-and diglycosides (the other 13 compounds). In the analyzed samples of E. longistipitata, 14 fatty acid-related compounds were identified, but coumarins and furochromones that were found in E. longistipitata were the most interesting result; furochromones khelloside, khellin, visnagin, and cimifugin were found in E. longistipitata for the first time. Couma-rins 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin, scoparone, fraxetin, and luvangetin and furochromones methoxsalen, 5-O-methylvisammioside, and visamminol-3\u2032-O-glucoside were detected for the first time in the genus Eranthis Salisb. For all the above compounds, the structural formulas are given. Furthermore, detailed information (with structural formulas) is provided on the diversity of chro-mones and furochromones in other representatives of Eranthis. The presence of chromones in plants of the genus Eranthis confirms its closeness to the genus Actaea L. because chromones are synthesized by normal physiological processes only in these members of the Ranunculaceae family.\nSaponins have been studied for more than four decades and their relevance is due to their numerous biological and chemical activities. Indeed, saponins are attracting attention for their industrial exploitation in connection with their pharmacological properties. Saponins also find many applications in the food industry and in the cosmetics industry due to their foaming and emulsifying property. On the other hand, depending on the type of saponin, the species that ingests it and the context, they are more or less toxic to the body. This article describes a number of investigations works carried out on saponins to determine the impact of saponins on health.\nBaikalsky State Nature Biosphere Reserve is situated in the central part of the Khamar-Daban Range (Southern Baikal, Siberia), in three administrative districts of Republic of Buryatia (i.e. Kabansky District, Dzhidinsky District and Selenginsky District), Russia. In general, this territory has been relatively well studied by botanists, but until now there was no detailed information about the flora of the Reserve with precise geographic localities. Moreover, some records in the Baikalsky Reserve's flora were published without references to documenting herbarium specimens. The dataset contains 39,238 unique occurrences of 875 taxa (854 species, 14 subspecies, five varieties and two species aggregates) from the Baikalsky Reserve and its buffer zone. All the data were acquired during the field studies by the author in 2009\u20132021, when 152 taxa (17.3% of all the taxa included into the dataset) were first recorded by the author from the study area. Herbarium vouchers are preserved in the Moscow University Herbarium (MW). This dataset is the first attempt at creating a database of vascular plants of the Baikalsky Reserve and its buffer zone, based on modern research. These data will provide the background for the updated check-list of the Baikalsky Reserve's flora.\nIAPT chromosome data 30/4. In: Marhold, K. & al. (eds.), IAPT chromosome data 30.\nThe relationships among species in the genus Eranthis Salisb. were investigated using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the nuclear DNA internal transcribed spacer 1, 2 region (nrITS) and the chloroplast trnL-trnF interspacer region (cpIS). Phylogenetic relationships based on the nrITS and cpIS were inferred with posterior probabilities with STRUCTURE analysis and the neighbor-joining method. Two major clades from nrITS and cpIS were consistent with species with yellow sepals in E. hyemalis, E. cilicica, E. longistipitata and the hybrid E. \u00d7tubergenii; and white sepals in E. sibirica, E. longituba, E. albiflora, E. stellata, E. pungdoensis, E. byunsanensis, and E. pinnatifida. The phylogenetic tree of nrITS formed more subclades than the tree of cpIS, which suggested that nrITS SNPs are useful molecular markers for phylogenetic studies in the genus Eranthis. Only the SNPs of cpIS in E. pungdoensis accessions had a deletion at positions 259\u2013420, and the posterior probability values (PPVs) assigned E. pungdoensis to population 4, which suggested that E. pungdoensis is different from E. byunsanensis. Therefore, E. byunsanensis and E. pungdoensis are considered to be true-to-type based on q-values because the PPVs were greater than 0.9 in both species based on the STRUCTURE analysis of nrITS SNPs. Significant genetic variation in E. stellata collected in Goesan-kun and Mt. Mugap, Korea indicated a potential gene flow among closely related E. byunsanensis, E. pinnatifida, E. sibirica, and E. stellata that could be due to geographic proximity in their distributions. E. stellata from Mt. Mugap showed mixed PPVs for E. stellata and E. byunsanensis, therefore, E. byunsanensis might be a possible hybrid origin for E. stellata collected from Goesan-kun and Mt. Mugap.\nThe temporal and spatial origins and evolution of the genus Eranthis have not been previously studied. We investigated the speciation and establishment histories of four Eranthis species: Eranthis byunsanensis, E. pungdoensis, E. stellata, and E. pinnatifida. The sampling localities were Korea, Japan, Jilin in China, and the area near Vladivostok in Primorskiy, Russia. We used 12 chloroplast microsatellite loci (n = 935 individuals) and two chloroplast noncoding regions (rpl16 intron, petL\u2010psbE intergenic spacer; n = 33 individuals). The genetic diversity, genetic structure, phylogenetic relationships of the four species were analyzed, and their ancestral areas were reconstructed. The high genetic diversity of the Jeju island population of E. byunsanensis and Russian populations of E. stellata indicated these species\u2019 northward and southward dispersal, respectively. The genetic structure analyses suggest that the populations in these four species have limited geographical structure, except for the Chinese E. stellata population (SCP). The phylogenetic analyses suggest that E. byunsanensis and E. pinnatifida are<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " this Monday! Cultural lost in translation moment of the day\u2026.check! Korea, one, Lauren, zero :).\nWe ended our jaunt at Elizabeth\u2019s house. She lives 40 minutes away from me, and by then I was wayyy too tired to walk anymore \u2013 we had walked for about 4.5 hours. So I took a taxi back, and told him where to go\u2026in Korean\u2026.all by myself!! And I didn\u2019t just use one word, I used a whole sentence!! It was exhilarating. Actually, the more I hang out with foreigners here, the more encouraged I am with my Korean skills. Most of the people I\u2019ve met have been here at least a year, some two or more \u2013 and most of them can speak veryyy little Korean. Some of them can\u2019t even read the alphabet. Granted, they all live in private apartments, and their jobs are English teachers, so they obviously don\u2019t get much of an opportunity to practice much, but it\u2019s still encouraging nonetheless to see how much I actually learned in just 6 short weeks of orientation.\nSunday was equally as epic. Taking a meandering walk may not seem epic to you, but when everything is a struggle to find and ask for and understand, even the little accomplishments seem big :). On our walk, I was also struck by how much of the city I really HAVE explored. I\u2019ve been feeling very isolated and lonely and lost the past week. But as I was talking with Elizabeth and telling her what I knew of the regions of the city as we passed them, I realized that I\u2019m really not as lost as I thought I was. I told her about Metro, where there is a weekly poker game on Wednesday nights; dalk galbi is where many foreign English teachers congregate every Friday night for dinner; there\u2019s the library that has a weekly English story reading program to Korean children on Saturdays, which I\u2019m hoping to get involved in; the dance studio and Thursday night salsa club, which I still have to check out; softball or frisbee games on the University soccer fields on the weekends; free Korean language classes on Tuesday nights; the huge park that has free outdoor concerts during the summer; and of course, the English speaking church, which was the whole purpose of our walk to begin with. Talking with Elizabeth about all of these things that I\u2019ve found in the week that I\u2019ve been here reminded me that I really can do this!!! It was good to be reminded\u2026.I had almost forgotten.\nBut anyway, I was talking about how epic Sunday was!! Even though we never did find the church on our walk, it turned out to not matter. I also found a number to call to speak to someone in English for more information about the church. I called it, and it turns out it was the cell phone of like a deacon of the church, who actually offered to pick me up and drive me to church. So I gladly accepted, and by 10:30 Sunday morning I found myself weaving through the intimidating hallways of a huge Korean church to find the tiny English service. The English service is super small \u2013 not even 50 people \u2013 and most of the people who attend are actually Koreans who want to practice their English. But there were also some foreigners \u2013 mostly from South Africa, which is cool \ud83d\ude42 \u2013 and everyone, Korean and foreign alike, were really nice. It was sooo nice to be in a church again. It was very low-key \u2013 just a guitar, keyboard, and acoustic hymns. But it blessed me, nonetheless. After the service, I was talking with some of the other people, trying to get to know them. I may be an outgoing person, but since I\u2019ve been in Gyeongju I\u2019ve been putting myself out there FAR more than I normally would. It\u2019s been uncomfortable, but I feel like I need to do it now before I get stuck in a rut of isolation, so I\u2019ve been really working overtime to meet people and get involved in the things that are important to me.\nSo anyway, we were talking, and one of the girls I met, Andrea, mentioned that she was planning on going to Pohang (about a 30-minute bus ride) with her boyfriend right after church. I had been really wanting to explore the bus system, and this seemed like a perfect opportunity to do it with a guide and company, instead of having to do it by myself like I\u2019d done so many other things. So I timidly asked if I could tag along. She said yes, and off to Pohang we went! We had to take a bus to get to the main bus terminal, and then another one to Pohang. We had lunch there, and then went to a few department stores \u2013 they had to get some things for their apartments. After a few hours, we made our way back to Gyeongju and parted ways. It may not have been a huge deal; but to me it was. Getting out of the city, seeing another part of Korea, connecting with people who share my values, making a friend\u2026it was really needed. I didn\u2019t really realize how needed until it happened.\nI can\u2019t believe how blessed I am. I am so unbelievably humbled that God has allowed me to see the things I\u2019ve seen, and experience the things I\u2019ve experiences, and meet the people I\u2019ve met. My life has been a wild ride, truly incredible \u2013 and I\u2019m only 21.\nSince Sunday morning, I\u2019ve been so completely overwhelmed. In some ways, I\u2019ve been overwhelmed in a bad way \u2013 lots of Korean, and teaching, and strange foods and new experiences and unknown places. But more than anything, I\u2019ve been overwhelmed by God\u2019s provision. Last night I met up with Nia, an English teacher from California who\u2019s been here for a year. I had been talking with her on the Gyeongju Foreigners facebook group (ahh, the wonders of modern technology!), and we agreed to meet up last night so she could show me around. She took me to this great Russian restaurant, and introduced me to a few other foreigners living in the area. She showed me where the downtown area was, and the direction of the English-speaking church (to which I have since been given very exact directions, woohoo!! I\u2019m so excited about Sunday!), and showed me where a dance studio is, and told me how to find more Korean classes at the University in Gyeongju, and told me about the festivals that go on in Gyeongju, and where all the great hotspots are (both foreign and Korean), and basically made me feel so taken care of that I could cry.\nAnd she\u2019s not the only one. There\u2019s a softball game going on this weekend that another American invited me to, and she even offered to meet me by my house and take a taxi with me to the location. Someone else \u2013 another dancer, woohoo!! \u2013 sent me a message and said that if I found a place to dance to let him know, and he would gladly accompany me and be my partner. I found out that yesterday my host mother called the school and asked if someone could take me home after school, because it was raining and I hadn\u2019t brought my umbrella. The ETA who was previously at my school called me today just to check up on me and make sure that I\u2019m doing alright. My Korean co-teacher picked me up from my house and took me to school today because he didn\u2019t want me to have to walk. My host sister showed me where a stationary store was after school today so I could get supplies for my classes.  They loved that I tried to speak in Korean, and all of my students today enjoyed their class, and basically everyone was just super excited to have me there.\nThey are certainly not alone in their excitement. I love my school. ETAs are generally allowed to leave earlier than the other teachers, so I had 3 different teachers come up to me this afternoon and ask me why I hadn\u2019t left yet. It was because I didn\u2019t want to. I was having fun, and I really enjoy the atmosphere of the school. I also taught my first \u201cofficial\u201d class today! Actually, I taught 4 classes \u2013 back to back to back to back. Four straight hours of class \u2013 it was exhausting. And all of them by myself. Technically, ETAs are supposed to have a Korean co-teacher in the room with them for every class they teach, but my school could only spare a teacher for about 4 classes, so I requested that they give me more classes and don\u2019t worry about a co-teacher. And they did. And it was hard, and it was alot of work, but it was also so much fun.\nIt was also a good introduction to the Korean educational system. Korean schools are infamous for having last minute schedule changes, class switches, and failed technology. Well, I had prepared a beautiful first-day powerpoint, with pictures, and animations, and everything. I got to my classroom, only to find that the computer has not been connected yet. So, I had to improvise on the fly. Of course, if I could have my druthers, I would rather have had everything work smoothly, but I made do with what I had, the kids had fun, and I grew as a teacher. So everything worked out alright.\nWe left Goesan for Seoul bright and early Friday morning, around 5:00 am in the morning. On our way to Seoul, however, we made a detour \u2013 to the DMZ. I\u2019ve always thought that the DMZ \u2013 which stands for Demilitarized Zone \u2013 is an ironic<|endoftext|>"

But when she finally located her assumed half-sister, the woman closed the door in her face and called police.\nNow a court will rule Friday in a landmark case on Bos' demand to be officially registered as her father's child.\nIt could set a precedent offering nearly 250,000 adoptees a chance to demand legal recognition as members of their biological families -- and uncover a host of long-hidden family secrets.\nBos, now 38, was two when she was found alone at a Goesan market, south of Seoul, and 10 months later she was adopted by an American couple.\nShe rarely thought about her birth family growing up, but when her daughter turned two, it hit her \"deeply what it really meant to abandon a child at this age\".\n\"I thought about the excruciating pain my mother must have gone through to have to do this, and I wondered about the circumstances she could have been in to have to choose this painful path,\" Bos said.\nEfforts to trace her parents through adoption records proved fruitless, so she submitted a DNA sample to an online genealogy platform in 2016 and found she was related to a young Korean man studying abroad.\nThey established a relationship and worked out their common ancestor had to be his grandfather -- the only person who could tell her who her mother was.\nBut his family wanted nothing to with her, rejecting her request to meet her father.\n\"It didn't matter the countless emails I sent begging and promising secrecy and never to contact them again if I could just find out my truth,\" she said.\n\"Even when I begged on my knees out of desperation in front of his oldest daughter's door for a face to face they would not allow me, and instead called the police on me,\" she told AFP, calling her plight \"excruciatingly painful\".\nShe filed a paternity suit, a move that revealed the man's address.\nWhen she appeared at his door asking in basic Korean if he knew her face, he \"looked straight at me but then waved me off\".\nNonetheless a court-ordered DNA test showed there was a 99.987 percent probability he was her father.\n\"I just started wailing,\" Bos said. \"The truth had just set me free.\"\nBos is seeking to be included in the man's family registry, an official Korean document detailing all household members.\nIf Friday's court rules goes in her favour she will be the first South Korean adoptee so recognised, giving her a legal entitlement to an inheritance and making her eligible to apply for South Korean citizenship.\nAround 250,000 South Korean children have been adopted since the 1950s, according to Seoul's welfare ministry data, most of them overseas -- the country was once among the biggest sources for international adoption.\nAfter the Korean War it was a way to remove children, born to local mothers and American GI fathers, from a country that emphasised ethnic homogeneity.\n\nHosu Kim, a sociology professor at the City University of New York who researches South Korean birth mothers, up to 15 percent of adoptions \"point to extra-marital affairs\", with the resulting children never acknowledged.\nThe South's existing laws prioritise birth parents' privacy over adoptees' rights, and the issue is shrouded in secrecy -- many adoption files contain falsified information, or simply none.\nBos was only able to pursue her case because of the online DNA match.\nBut<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "So, do I need a new bathtub?\nThread: So, do I need a new bathtub?\nYes, Medicare is a federal program and Medicaid is a state. Health insurance companies typically adhere to Medicare guidelines and won't pay for anything once you cross he threshold into the bathroom. Someone at MC apparently doesn't consider bathing and pooping medically-necessary; go figure. Medicaid will, and does, pay for our commode/shower chairs, depending upon the state. I'd venture to guess that, from our experience, maybe about half the states will pay for all, or some part.\nIf not, try your states Vocational Rehab Department. Every state has one and the odds of them paying are somewhat better than Medicaid. You can find a list of state offices at: http://www.goesanywhere.com/links_and_resources.php [7th one down]. To be eligible, you need to at least ACT like you want to work.\nCommunity-based non-profit sources are the next step.\nIf you don't have any luck with any of these, we offer our customers the option of making 3 payments, interest-free, over 3 months. Typically, that amounts to under $500 for each of the 3 payments.\nOk, so it sounds like maybe I should hold off on this for just a second until the medicaid kicks in (fingers crossed..), and I see what they will be willing to pay for.\nI've also considered some type of sliding board and some lotion - over to a plastic shower chair. why not that instead of the expensive sliding ones? Not to knock them b/c they look really convenient, but.. does anyone do it this way, does it work good? He can't do transfers right now - he's just learning how to do it..But.. His arms are getting stronger every day, and I think that with my help, we could get him over the tub that way. Any thoughts on that?\nComplete safety is your friend and the best path to maximum recovery. It also best for you to preserve your strength and avoid any strains, etc. And whatever is good for you is good for him. I am glad to hear he is getting stronger.\nWhere is he in rehab? The OT and PT should be addressing this equipment and also working on tub transfer skills with him. Lotion on a slide board is a bad idea...a good way to slide right off the board and fall, and also will get greasy lotion all over him and interfere with you holding on to him to assist.\nVirtually impossible for someone without very strong triceps to do this. The person in question has a C6 SCI and is still in rehab...doubt they will be strong enough to do this when they are booted out of rehab after an average 4 week stay!!!\nThought he was a para from \"immobile from torso down\" statement...sorry.\nYeah, shortly after the lotion and sliding board idea, I had a vision of a slippery husband crashing to the floor No good, you're right. We have seen nothing of this kind of training, but he's having problems with low blood pressure every time he is up for awhile - its getting in the way of the rehabilitation at this point. Hope it works itself out soon!\nMy husband is still in a rehabilitation hospital, and I'm trying to prepare for him to return home. My main concern right now is the Bathtub. We just have a standard tub/ shower, and I wonder if there will be a way for one person (me) to help him into it, or if I really have to change it to a standing shower type with no tub. He is currently completely immobile from torso down, but his arms are getting stronger every day. I don't even think a shower chair will FIT into our tub?\nSorry that your husband was injured and now has a spinal cord injury. Is he a fellow Veteran? If so the closest VA SCI Center should be contacted. There are a lot of things that the VA will pay for ex: wheelchairs, cushions, electric beds, low air loss/alternating pressure mattress etc...\nYou can go to youtube and search for \"para\" or \"quad\" transferring and get a lot of ideas and examples.\nYour welcome. Thank you for your nice reply. I was so hoping for a lot of reasons that your husband was a fellow Veteran. If he's able to ever return back to work he should make sure he calls the local State Vocational Rehabilitation Office for an appointment to see if he's eligible for any help and retraing through Voc Rehab.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "I would like to thank Dr. Nguyen Van Kien, the founder of Mekong Organics, who had introduced me to the 4th IFOAM Asia Organic Youth Forum. The forum had equipped an entire horizon of organic movement in Taiwan, offered great time to share and learn from other organic researchers, organic growers, private sectors and governments in Taiwan and other regions of the world.\nThe IFOAM Asia Organic Youth Forum was set up in 2017 by the first trainees who had met in Goesan County, South Korea in 2016 for the 1st Organic Foundation Course undertaken by the Asian Local Governments for Organic Agriculture (ALGOA), a special project of IFOAM Asia. Currently, the Organic Youth Forum consists of more than 120 youths in 16 countries in Asia. At the 4th Organic Youth Forum, it was my honor to be one of twenty-two carefully selected foreign youths to join more than 50 local youths in Taiwan for a training and exchange on the fundamentals of organic agriculture and to forge networks and alliances that will drive the development of the organic sector in Asia.\n\u25cf CARE: Organic Agriculture should be managed in a precautionary manner to protect the health and well being of current and future generations and the environment.\n\u25cf HEALTH: Organic Agriculture should sustain and enhance the health of soil, plant, animal, human and planet as one and indivisible.\n\u25cf ECOLOGY: Organic Agriculture should be based on living ecological systems and cycles, work with them, emulate them and help sustain them.\n\u25cf FAIRNESS: Organic Agriculture should build on relationships that ensure fairness with regard to the common environment and life opportunities.\nThe president of IFOAM Asia, Dr. Zhou Zejiang, showed an entire look of organic farming development from 1.0 to 3.0. In 2017, according to FiBL survey 2019, organic agricultural land reached an all-time height with 69.8 million hectares, accounting for 1.4 percent of the organic agricultural land. Australia had the largest area of organic agricultural land (35.65 million hectares), followed by Argentina and China (3.39 and 3.02 million hectares respectively). Most of the organic producers were in Asia and Africa. However, the local markets in those areas were very small, and the organic production was mainly focus for exports. There was a strong need to strengthen the local organic markets in order to ensure a sustainable development of the organic sector worldwide.\nDr. Zhou Zejiang proposed some strategies to widely develop organic farming in Asia. Farmers should not only take advantage of good natural condition, chose local crops and animal species, but also produce non-GMO products. Apart from international markets, local market should be considered importantly as well. Whoever involving in farming should keep in mind of farmers\u2019 benefits as farmers are the bases of real organic. Moreover, government support had better to be in the forms of technology, training, organic inputs, farming tools, market exploring, organizing, etc. rather than cash only.\nI got a chance to participate in the International Conference of 2019 Organic Youth Forum on March 29th, 2019. Mr. Chia-Wei Chang, Section Head, Department of Agriculture, introduced about New Taipei City Government\u2019s Organic Farming Policies. The governments showed a high commitment to develop organic farming section in Taiwan through increasing organic value chain and global trends in sustainable agricultural products. Mr. Mathew John, Founder-Director, Keystone Foundation, shared valuable experience in order to build a Participatory Guarantee System which encouraged the development and adoption of simple and different approaches to guarantee organic produce. The forum also discussed effective ways to create diverse markets for organic products and the role of local governments & youth in organic agricultural movement.\nThe two last days of the trip, our group visited an organic tea plantation by a youth farmer and Eco-friendly farm in Yilan. The farm was initiated by a young man who wanted to protect a precious bird species by encouraging all the old farmers to change their farming practice into organic farming. Then I visited the process of the organic lunch program in New Taipei City (From the organic cutting factory, organic farms and introductions about the whole process). Finally, the group went to an indigenous tribe\u2019s farm which put emphasis on the education of food and agriculture.<|endoftext|>"

Make sure youre using real bacon pieces and not imitation flavored bits. These are usually found in the salad dressing aisle and should say that theyre real bacon on the packaging. Ive also found that this bacon holds up best to the moisture from the broccoli salad.\nKeep in mind that ultimately broccoli salad is meant to be an indulgent side dish, and not health food!\nOK, I hope I didnt lose you with all of the broccoli photos!\nWhen making a pasta salad, its best to toss it in A LOT of dressing to prevent it from drying out and getting pasty. Instead of using all mayo, we add in a bit of sour cream to cut through the fat, making it less oily. You can also use yoghurt or Mexican crema.\nWHAT TYPE OF MAYONNAISE? I suggest using whole egg mayo as it tends to be less sweeter and creamier than regular mayo.VINEGAR: adds a kick of tang! You can use white vinegar, apple cider vinegar, or white wine vinegar. Substitute with lemon juice for a citrus kick.DIJON MUSTARD adds MORE flavour, making it nice and thick.MINCED GARLIC completes the flavour profile. You can use garlic powder, onion powder or minced shallots if you prefer.\nMacaroni salad might not be wild or glamorous, but it sure gets invited to a lot of parties. Easy to make and endlessly customizable, homemade macaroni salad is welcome everywhere it goesand did I mention that it gets along with just about any other dish on the menu? So, when it comes to choosing side dishes for picnics, potlucks, or even just everyday meals, don\u2019t overlook the macaroni salad! Here are some of our favorites, featuring classic macaroni salad, Amish macaroni salad, Hawaiian macaroni salad, and more.\n\u201cA colorful and flavorful macaroni salad made with hard cooked eggs, bell pepper and celery in a creamy dressing,\u201d says recipe creator CONNIE0751. This sweet macaroni salad is one of the most popular macaroni salads on Allrecipes.\nThe dressing can be made up to 3 days ahead and refrigerated the pasta, vegetables, and basil can be prepared up to 1 day ahead and refrigerated. Before serving, bring all of the components to room temperature. Add the dressing to a large bowl and whisk to loosen, then stir in the pasta, vegetables and herbs. Taste and adjust seasoning and serve.\nThe dressing for this macaroni salad is my favorite! It has a bit of tang thanks to the vinegar. Plus a bit of sweetness thanks to the small amount of sugar being added. And the dijon mustard adds a wonderful flavoring.\nMix together the dressing in a small bowl and add to the cooked macaroni and add ins. You can substitute some of the mayonnaise for sour cream or greek yogurt if desired.\nIf you are storing the macaroni salad overnight or for a couple of days, you may need to mix together some more of the dressing to stir into the salad before serving. The salad will soak in a lot of the dressing as it sits over a few days.\nCook the macaroni according to the package instructions. Then drain and rinse the pasta with cold water, and transfer to a large bowl.\nMix together the mayonnaise, apple cider vinegar, sugar, hot sauce, garlic, salt, and pepper in a small dish to make the macaroni salad dressing.\nCombine the pasta and dressing. Then add the chopped roasted red peppers, kale, cooked bacon, pickle relish, and scallions.\nToss well to coat. Refrigerate until ready to serve and enjoy this mac salad recipe cold.\nToday Im sharing my take on my grandmothers shrimp pasta salad recipe. Its a close cousin to my popular macaroni salad with a surprisingly tasty seafood twist.\nThe perfect companion to your next BBQ, serve it alongside pulled BBQ chicken and ice cold lemonade.\nMy family has been enjoying this recipe for years and I was a little surprised that it hadnt made its way onto the blog yet. Because I cant help myself, I made a few variations to make this recipe my own, but if youd like to see her original recipe just scroll to the bottom of the post beneath the recipe card.<|endoftext|>"

The old common translation, pao cai (salted fermented vegetables), would be withdrawn.\nThe problem is that there is no Chinese character to represent the pronunciation of kimchi. As a result, the Agriculture Ministry reportedly considered some 4,000 Chinese characters before deciding on xinqi, saying it looked a bit like kimchi.\nWith this new name, the Seoul government hopes to draw a clear line between Korean kimchi and Chinese pickled vegetables, the latter being called pao cai (\u6ce1\u83dc) in China.\n\u201cWith the use of the word \u2018xinqi\u2019 for kimchi in Chinese, the ministry expects Korean kimchi and Chinese pao cai to be clearly differentiated and awareness of the traditional South Korean dish, kimchi, to be strengthened in China, \u201dthe statement said.\nThe new directive is mandated for the South Korean government and affiliated organizations. But this is only a recommendation for South Korean private companies that need to translate the word kimchi into Chinese, in addition to Chinese media discussing the Korean dish.\nNonetheless, it sparked a wave of heated debate among the media and internet users in both countries.\nWhat is the difference between kimchi and pao cai?\nBefore delving deeper into the feud, one should understand the difference between kimchi and pao cai.\nKimchi is a collective term for over 100 types of fermented vegetables in Korea, but it most commonly refers to napa cabbage fermented with seasonings, including red chili, garlic, ginger, and salted seafood.\nFermented vegetables with different ingredients like chonggak kimchi (fermented radish kimchi) or with lower spice levels like baek kimchi (unspiced white cabbage kimchi) also fall under umbrella kimchi.\nA kimchi-making festival in Goesan, South Korea on November 7, 2020.

The orientations of c-axis of calcite and e twin plane were measured along with the average thickness and numbers of twins, and the widths of calcite grains. Twin strain, mean width, and intensity of twinning, and the relative magnitude and orientations of principal stresses were calculated using Calcite Strain Gauge program. Twin strain, mean width, and intensity of twinning showed ranges of 1.09-15.36%, 0.53-3.72 \u00b5m and 21.0-53.1 twim/mm, respectively. Metamorphic temperatures calculated from the twins were 170-200\u00b0C, indicating that the twins developed after the Pungchon limestone was uplifted to at least half of the maximum burial depth. Results for five of the samples indicate that the calcite twins formed during two events with principal stress axes of different orientations, while the remaining sample recorded only one event that produced calcite twins. The axis of maximum compressive stress was oriented mainly WNW-ESE to ENE-WSW, and to a lesser degree NW-SE and NE-SW. Comparison of paleostress orientations measured here and in other studies indicates that most twins were produced during the Songrim orogeny. However, the Daebo orogeny and the Bulguksa orogeny also produced calcite twins in the Punchon limestone.\nJang, B.A., 1994, The Mesozoic paleostress from healed microcracks in granites of north-eastern area of Ogcheon belt, Korea Science and Engineering Foundation, KOSEF, 57p.\nJang, B.A., Gim, J.A., 1996, Cretaceous paleostress from healed microcracks and fluid inclusions in granites from the Sogrisan and the Wolagsan area, Korea, Journal of the Geological Society of Korea, 32(3), 291-301.\nKim, J.H., Kee, W.S., Seo, S.K., 1996, Geological structures of the Yeoryang-Imgye area, northern part of Mt.

The total number of dwellings was about 5600. A survey of thoron and its decay products was also conducted in 2002-2005. In 2008-2009, a new radon survey in 1100 public buildings was conducted. The annual arithmetic (AM) and geometric (GM) means of indoor radon concentration in total were 62.1 \u00b1 66.4 and 49.0 \u00b1 1.9 Bq m(-3), respectively. The annual AM and GM means of indoor thoron concentrations were 40.4 \u00b1 56.0 and 10.7 \u00b1 2.9 Bq m(-3), respectively. The radon and thoron concentrations in detached houses were much higher than those in apartments. The locations of the high radon or thoron houses seem to be correlated with the concentrations of their parent nuclides in surface soil. The mean individual doses of radon and thoron were calculated to be 1.65 and 0.17 mSv y(-1), respectively.\n... In Korea, four national indoor radon surveys were conducted by the Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety (KINS) in 1988-89, 1999-2000, 2002-05 and 2008-09, respectively. The sample size was \u223c5600 dwellings and 1100 public buildings (schools and local governmental offices) (8).

In the case of Yeongyang county, although the indoor radon concentration was relatively low in the previous survey, only one township named Subi was selected for survey because it was adjacent to the higher concentration areas in Bonghwa and Uljin counties....\n... The maximum was 2370 Bq m \u22123. Yeongwol county showed the highest GM of 120 Bq m \u22123, which is higher than that of the national annual average (49 Bq m \u22123 ) by a factor of 2.4 (8). Also, Sangdong and Jungdong township, which belong to Yeongwol county, showed the highest GM of 141 Bq m \u22123 among all the townships....\nThe objective of this study is to determine indoor radon concentrations for 11 counties in Korea, develop a detailed radon distribution map and compare the results by some factors influencing indoor radon levels. The radon survey was conducted for 7 y in provisional radon-prone areas selected based on the previous national surveys. The total number of samples was >2.5% of the entire dwellings by each county. The annual average indoor radon concentration for the survey areas had a geometric mean of 94 Bq m\u22123 with 6.6% of all sampled dwellings showing values exceeding 300 Bq m\u22123. Some areas with relatively high indoor radon concentration were identified through a spatial distribution map. Seasonal variations were observed with commonly the highest concentration in winter, and house characteristics influencing indoor radon levels. This study can serve as a basis for developing national radon action plans and guide for additional regional radon surveys.\n... About 8% of the surveyed households in Korea showed levels above the 300 Bq/m 3 recommended by the International Commission for Radiation Protection. The average radon exposure was an estimated 1.65 mSv/year [4], which contributed to approximately 36% of the average annual ionizing exposure dose in the Korean population in 2007 [5]. Since 2011, the reported concentrations of measured indoor radon ranged from 102 to 124 Bq/m 3 [6], suggesting the need for the implementation of effective residential radon control measures....\n... Although the Republic of Korea has reported indoor radon concentrations since 1989 [4], few studies have assessed its health effects in Korea [11]. Here<|endoftext|>"
