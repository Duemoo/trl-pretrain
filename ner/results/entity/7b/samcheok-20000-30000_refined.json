I had always assumed that they were further up the coast around Samcheok or somewhere like that. It seemed that many Korean photographers knew about these places and I was at a loss to try and find out where they were.\nThen a fellow photographer named Brian Kim, introduced me to this area near Gyeongju a few years ago. It was amazing and also perfect for my side project photographing lighthouses. The area was located in front of the Songdaemal Lighthouse in the small village of Gampo.\nOne of the first things that I noticed about Gampo was the fact that it was so quiet in the mornings. It was a place that I usually catch the sunrise and at that time, there are usually very few people around. If there are, they are usually tucked in behind a camera too.\nSmall villages like this are something that many people don\u2019t see when they arrive in Korean and hit Seoul or Busan. These villages are typically centered around the port and the fishing industry. You won\u2019t find large supermarkets here. Just the local marts and perhaps a GS25 convenience store.\nIt\u2019s that sort of small town charm that keeps me coming back, aside from the stunning seascapes and the lighthouses. One of the times that I went, an elderly man approached as I was capturing one of the most interesting lighthouse designs out there. We had a short chat and he sad that the next time that I was coming through to pop in for a coffee, gesturing at his little shack by the port. It was a simple kind gesture but it sort of showed the nature of the kind of people out there.\nWhat brings most people out to the area are usually the rocks that jut out of the water near the Songdaemal Lighthouse. During the sunrise, which is arguably the best time to photograph here, it makes for a wonderful and dynamic shot.\nThe rocks also make it a perfect place to get in nice and tight and with a long enough exposure, make a really out of the world shot. So you are not just limited to scenic shots with a centred horizon that a few photographers do. There is enough variety to really experiment with the scene a bit more.\nThis was one of the things that really amazed me. In this area along there are about 3 distinct lighthouses with unique designs. This really can only be surpassed by Gijange. However, these lighthouses all share the historical themes linked to Gyeongju.\nNot to mention that you also have a piece of history with one of the oldest lighthouses in the area standing right next to Songdaemal. For a person that is interested in these amazing structures this is a special place.\nAn interesting note is that there is actually a button to ring the bell on the lighthouse that is shaped like the bells found at buddhist temples around Korea. So it is actually functional in that respect too!\nThe bottomline is that places like this are really off the beaten path but are so worth the visit. Gampo is located about just over an hour from Busan and about 2 hours or so from Daegu.\nHere is a link to the Songdaemal on Kakao Maps to help you locate it and get directions. Don\u2019t forget that if you are driving out there, the Kakao Maps app is in English and the navigation is also in English. This app is extremely useful in finding locations like this.\nThe post Exploring Gampo: A Hidden Gem appeared first on The Sajin.<|endoftext|>"

Damages took place in the region when tsunami occurred in the west of Japan in 1986 and 1993. Fear of the destruction caused by has increased following the 2011 Great Tsunami of Japan. The west coast of Japan embodies many high tsunami risk areas where tsunami may be triggered by earthquakes. As no earthquake has ever occurred there, these high risk areas contain high amount of potential energy. Furthermore, frequent high waves due to climate change have become one of the major factors with respect to coastal structure damage, beach erosion and various coastal disasters along the shoreline. In order to make a counterplan for coastal disaster, precise analysis of the high wave characteristics, through continuous monitoring, is essential. In this study, continuous long-term observation is implemented with an Ocean Radar. Ocean Radar conducts remote observation equipped with ground-based radars which enable series of simultaneous observations of extensive range of the coast with high frequency. Ocean Radar for continuous long-term observation is operated at Samcheok on the east coast of Korea. Samcheok has experienced tsunami damage in previous years and is where a nuclear power plant is located. In order to examine the reliability of the Ocean Radar, a pressure-type wave gauge, ultrasonic wave gauge, and ocean buoy are installed for data comparison and verification. The Ocean Radar used in this study is an array-type HF-RADAR named WERA (WavE RAdar). Data analysis of the continuous long-term observation verifies more than 90% of the wave data collected within 25km range from the center of two sites. Only less than 1% of the entire observation is unmeasured by time series analysis, but data from other wave gauges show similar features. Moreover, a comprehensive monitoring system supported by such observations is developed for the public for internet based real-time reports on waves and currents.\nKEYWORDS: coastal erosion, shoreline prediction, shoreline retreat, sediment shortage, GENESIS model, LIDAR data.\nAra\u00fajo, M.A.V.C., Di Bona, S., Trigo-Teixeira, A., 2014. Impact of detached breakwaters on shoreline evolution: a case study on the Portuguese west coast. In: Green, A.N. and Cooper, J.A.G. (eds.), Proceedings 13th International Coastal Symposium (Durban, South Africa), Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 70, pp. 041\u2013046, ISSN 0749-0208.\nThe Portuguese West Coast is facing severe erosion problems that threaten both the population andthe immediate seaside properties. Some locations, such as the Vagueira region, are especially vulnerable. In an attempt to reverse the present erosional trend, a coastal defense scheme involving two detached breakwaters was introduced in a phased manner. In this work, the impact of those two detached breakwaters on the down-drift coast is investigated. The study area extends from south of the Costa Nova village southwards to Mira. The shoreline evolution is predicted, for various decades, using the GENESIS model. The present time shoreline position, from which future situations are predicted, was obtained using LIDAR data acquired in 2011. Two different future scenarios are investigated: the \u2018do-nothing\u2019 scenario, which assumes that no further engineering interventions will be performed on the coast; and the \u2018detached breakwaters protected\u2019 scenario, with the first breakwater introduced in 2011 and the second in 2026. Depending on sediment supply, two types of simulations are carried out: calibrated simulations, which assume that the amount of sediments in the future will be equal to those in the present situation; and extreme simulations, which assume an acute shortage in sediment supply. Results show that if no further interventions are executed at the Vagueira region, the entire coastal stretch will continue to erode, which could lead to extreme consequences in some locations, depending on sediment supply. If two detached breakwaters are introduced at different intervals, a new accreting trend is predicted at the Vagueira region, reversing the present erosional phase. However, the erosional trend will continue southwards, unless a 3rd detached breakwater is introduced in Mira.\nKEYWORDS: Nearshore, sand spit, Pelnard-Consid\u00e8re, non-linear diffusion equation.\nBouchette, F., Manna, M., Montalvo, P., Nutz, A., Schuster, M.,Ghienne, J.-F., 2014.

(eds.), Proceedings 13th International Coastal Symposium (Durban, South Africa), Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 70 pp. 047\u2013052, ISSN 0749-0208.\nThe present work concerns cuspate spits: slightly symmetrical geomorphic features growing along the shoreline in shallow waters. We develop a new formulation for the dynamics of cuspate spits. Our approach relies on classical paradigms such as a conservation law to the shoreface scale and an explicit formula for alongshore sediment transport. We derive a non-linear diffusion equation and a fully explicit solution for the growth of cuspate spits. From this general expression, we found interesting applications to quantify shoreline dynamics in the presence of cuspate spits. In particular, we point out a simple method for the datation of a cuspate spit given a limited number of input parameters. Furthermore, we develop a method to quantify the mean alongshore diffusivity along a shoreline perturbed by well-defined cuspate spits of known sizes. Finally, we introduce a formal relationship between the geometric characteristics (amplitude, length) of cuspate spits, which reproduce the self-similarity of these geomorphic features.\nKEYWORDS: runup, setup, infragravity swash, coastal geomorphology, sandbar migration, cross shore sediment transport.\nCohn, N., Ruggiero, P., Ortiz, J., D.J. Walstra, 2014. Investigating the role of complex sandbar morphology on nearshore hydrodynamics. In: Green, A.N. and Cooper, J.A.G. (eds.), Proceedings 13th International Coastal Symposium (Durban, South Africa), Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 70, pp. 053\u2013058, ISSN 0749-0208.\nCoastal environments are characterized by complex feedbacks between flow, sediment transport, and morphology, often resulting in the formation of nearshore sandbars. In many locations, such as Hasaki (Japan), the Netherlands, and the Columbia River Littoral Cell (CRLC, USA), these sandbars exhibit a net offshore migration (NOM) cycle whereby these features form in the inner surf zone, migrate seaward and decay offshore on interannual cycles. Depending on the stage of the cycle, the number and configuration of the bars may differ widely. It has long been recognized that sandbars act as natural barriers during storm events by dissipating wave energy through breaking far from the beach face. Thus, dependent on the stage of the NOM cycle, one might expect significant variability in nearshore hydrodynamics. Using a non-linear wave model we demonstrate that inter-annual variability in sandbar configuration can significantly alter inner surf zone and swash zone processes. The model indicates that under different end-member NOM stages the same wave conditions can result in up to a 36% variance in the vertical extent of infragravity runup and can alter both the rate and direction of net cross shore sediment transport.\nKEYWORDS: volumetric cliff changes, airborne laser scanning, Storm surges, coastal erosion.\nKEYWORDS: rips, headland, current circulation, XBeach, offshore transport.\nAb Razak, M.S., Dastgheib, A., Suryadi, F.X., Roelvink, D. 2014.

I've been meditating on my own with an app called \"Viewing Your Mind\" and this month, I participated in an offline meeting called \"gPause\" for the first time. GPause was created by Chad Meng Tan, Google's 107th engineer, who dreamed of greater value when Google went public in 2003 and made enough money to live with his children at an early age, and that was the value of world peace.

Oh, that's nothing.\nWhat kind of person do you want to be remembered for?\nThere are some movies based on the original novel, but none are based on the original film.\nWhen I travel, I take a lot of pictures to make my memories. Photographs definitely bring back the senses, but I learned by blogging that pictures alone do not preserve memories for a long. The scrupulous writing on the bottom of the picture makes the taste, mood and feeling of the time much stronger. On the contrary, it reminds us of things that we didn't remember. Writing is a time-consuming task. So you need a will to write. I remember the last time I went on a trip, I made up my mind to finish today's record before it passed, and I tried to put up with the sleepy. The reason why I decided to finish the record by the end of the day is because I wanted to have time to enjoy tomorrow in full because I have experience tomorrow. These days, however, we seem to communicate through video rather than writing. Images are more stimulating and accessible than text. In a word, I can see more. It's fun to see images of various materials, but I think it's clear that there's an even more organized and compressed appeal. Just as various videos are uploaded on YouTube, I sometimes wish it was an era when various writings are uploaded. While I was thinking about it, I was very pleased that the Publicity was the place I wanted to be. Publicity is a system that only allows users to post their writings with video or pictures so far, so if they want to receive many \"thanks\" or drawings, they need to have eye-catching pictures or videos. I don't think it's a place where people can communicate by writing. It may be an idea that runs counter to the times, but I hope you can express yourself through writing or communicate with only writing. So, you will have a culture that stimulates your imagination. There are some movies based on the original novel, but none are based on the original film.

It's still a nice day to go to the winter sea. What do you think of when you see the sea? In the past, I felt like the sea was going to hold everything, and my mind was getting bigger. From some point on, I felt like I was going to be able to see the end of the ocean and I couldn't see the end of it. I thought that people who grew up in a sea-viewed area and those who didn't might have a different emotional or psychological state. Someday, I want to live in a place where the sea is visible.\n'hanwoo seolleongtang' is a popular restaurant in 100,000 cities.\nGangwon Province that about 100,000 people, has a population of donghae.

There are only two delicious dishes. seolleongtang and ojoktang According to my friend, seolleongtang is more delicious. 10,000 won may be thought to be a little expensive, but there are lots of meat and lots of sheep. Unlike any other seolleongtang, the soup with the right liver is impressive. According to Sledge, he tried to recruit this place from Starfield, but failed... I don't know if it's true, but it's a popular flavor.\nMy way to work is relatively quiet.\nMy way to work is relatively quiet. The subway station is not crowded and most people go to work in the opposite direction, so there is always a place to sit in the subway. That's why you can 'comparably easily' protect public morals that you get down first and later on. After taking the subway, take the village bus. I might miss the village bus, but I never run. This is because the village bus circulates in three to five minutes as if it were a subway. Every time I take a village bus, the long line is impressive. Most people come to work at the same time, and people who run buses will also adjust the distance between trains to avoid being pushed back in that time. Looking at the neat lines, it suddenly occurred to me that line-up was one of the things that grew bigger and less. Why do we line up? The reason why I line up is because I believe that if I wait in turn, my turn will come. That's why I don't do the cutting-edge. If standing in line is nothing but caring for others, I will not stand in line. You start pushing back and forth, you cut in next to each other, and then you get into And that's a matter of course. If you wait still, the bus will only leave every time. It is guaranteed to be mine if you wait. That is the basis for maintaining order. In the world, the chicken comes first. There are many problems such as \"Is an egg first?\" Do you make order, or do you make room? I think my leisurely work environment has created order this time. The reason why I'm relaxed at work is actually that. The fact that the majority of them are heading in the opposite direction from the direction they go.It would be nice if we had a society where our destinations are different from each other. So it would be good for a society that doesn't care about others, doesn't push others, and doesn't have to bump into others. Photo information, Bali. That was my way to work...\nGuess what!

One is in the company and one is in the apartment where I live in. If there is something in common between you two, it's very noble and very kind. Oh, it's best to be diligent. Let's fix them both. She always makes her makeup look nice and she's holding a cleaning tool. A person in the company sometimes encounters dressing up in the bathroom. It seems that the time of work is around 3-4 p.m. unlike the average office worker, when you see him dressed up, you can imagine that his true life begins after work, as any office worker. Sure, one day is divided into hours at work and hours at work. The reason why the lady's good looks came to me meaningfully is that they are kind to me. Say hello to me, who is often told that I don't like to greet you because I don't have good looks, and I thank you for that.  It's neither a timely nor me, but I'd like to talk about it. I feel good. In fact, the job of cleaning lady is going to be tough. You have to come out of the morning to clean your house before you go to work, and as you can see, your job is to do things that are repeated.

The map showed the Argonaut island as Takeshima and Ullengdo (Dagelet) as Matsushima. There is no mentioning of Liancourt rocks. So this map means that one of the intellectual Koreans in those days who once worked in Ulleungdo didn't know about Liancourt rocks.\nKim Ok-gyun was not only a Korean intellectual; he was the man in charge of moving settlers to Ulleungdo until he had to flee Korea in 1884, which means he should have known better than anyone the situation on Ulleungdo in 1884. And since his map did not show Liancourt Rocks, we can assume that he either did not know of the rocks or did not consider them to be a part of Korean territory.\nYes, I read Aki's post, which was very good.\nFor example, the 1865 map which was made in Paris indicated Ousan precisely just next to Ulleungdo.\nI saw some German-made maps of Korea which were made in 1892, 1894 & 1897.\nAll these maps are very accurate, as they show Ulleungdo as \"Matsushima (Dagelet I.)\" and Liancourt rocks as \"Liancourt Rocks (Hornet rocks)\", and they don't include the ghost island of Argonaut.\nAdditionally, all these maps coloured both \"Matsushima (Dagelet I)\" and \"Liancourt rocks (Hornet rocks)\" as the same colour as Japan.\nIt seems that western countries in those days recognised as Ulleungdo as Japanese territory, although this was not true, but which may mean that there is no chance for Korea to claim that Liancourt rocks to be their territory.\nP.S. I got a few of these maps from e-Bay recently.\nInteresting maps, Pacifist. I have bookmarked that page.\nI think we have already talked about one of the maps HERE.\nBy the way, did you see the maps on the link that Kaneganese told us about HERE?\nYes, I saw some of the maps in the site (of Alabama Univ) and noticed that although American maps usually conveyed Argonaut I (as Take I.) until early 20th century (1902-1903), German maps (printed in Leipzig) excluded Argonaut I even in 1890's.\nP.S. Some maps can be seen too in the following Texas site, although not so many.\nTo follow is American-made map of Korea. It doesn't include Liancourt rocks, although it includes Ulleungdo.\n\"I am not exactly sure how to interpret all the writing, so I think more study is needed.\"\nI couldn't really understand what you are trying to say\u3000(Sorry...), but if you are not so sure about the year when the map was made right now, maybe the title sould be written as \"1884 - 1888?.... \" in order to avoid any confusion for the readers at least until you become sure about it? I think it would be more friendly to the readers. Not everyone read comment section. But posting your ideas and findings itself is great since it would give us a chance to study more about the map, and hopefully, someone gives us more information about it.\nGood idea, Kaneganese, but I think I will put \"1884 - 1994\" without a question mark since I am pretty sure of that date.\nAnyway, what I was trying to say was that if the \"Ulleungdo-Jang\" (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6\u9577) was the \"Manho\" (\u842c\u6236) out of Weolsong-jin (\u8d8a\u677e\u93ad), then that would mean the map could be dated between 1888 and 1895 since that was the time the Weolsong-jin Manho was Ulleungdo-Jang.\nBetween 1884 and 1888, the Camp Commander at Samcheok replaced the Ulleungdo-Jang, but was called \"Ulleungdo Cheomsa,\" instead.\nIf you look at the writing on the map, you will see that \"Weolsong\" (\u8d8a\u677e) is written just before, which would suggest he was out of Weolsong, but in small letters next to \"Ulleungdo-Jang\" (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6\u9577) is written \"Pyeonghae, Samcheok-po Jin\" (\u5e73\u6d77\u4e09\u4e09\u965f\u6d66\u93ad), which suggests he was out of Samcheok-po Jin. Do you see my confusion now?\nThe fact that Ulleungdo appeared on the Samcheok map makes me believe that the map was made when the Ulleungdo-Jang was the Samcheok commander, which was between 1884 and 1888. The only problem with that is that he was not called \"Ulleungdo-Jang,\" but was called \"Ulleungdo Cheomsa.\" However, I am thinking that \"Ulleungdo-Jang\" could have been his unofficial title since he replace the previous Ulleungdo-Jang.\nYes, I know it is a little confusing.\nAt any rate, I think we can safely say the map was made between 1884 and 1894. I stopped it at 1894, instead of 1895, because that was the upper limit for the map given by Koryo University, who probably had a good reason for dating it up to 1894.\nSo, I think this means this was the last Korean map of Ulleungdo made before the 1900 Imperial Edict that made Ulleungdo and her neighboring islands a county of Gangwon Province. Of course, it is possible that U Yong-jeong (\u79b9\u7528\u9f0e) made a map of Ulleungdo that we do not know about since he inspected the island in 1900, before the edict was proclaimed.\nI got it finally. Besides, as long as \"\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6\u9577\" is listed, it is highly unlikely to be made 1700's, in the first place, right?\n\"I think I will put \"1884 - 1994\" without a question mark since I am pretty sure of that date.\"\nYou mean \"1884 - 1894\"? As long as you are sure about it, yes, it's good. Anyway, good find, Gerry. By the way, isn't it possible to send some question to Koryo University to ask how they defined the year of the map was made, like Shimane prefecture site?\nI'm not sure if this non-official map has anything to do with 1900 Imperial Edict or not, but the text on the map does include some new information on Usando and Ulleungdo, so it is a very important for us. I really hope Korean make all the documents \u79b9\u7528\u9f0e supposed to submit to Korean government public.\nYes, I meant 1884 to 1894. Sorry.\nIf Koryo University dated the map between 1835 and 1894, then that means they do not know the date of the map.\nKorean maps are usually dated by the name change of some village or mountain that is recorded in Korean records. If the map reflects that change, or does not reflect it, then scholars can use that to narrow down the date of Korean maps. In the case of this map, the person looking at it obviously overlooked the mention of \"Ulleungdo-Jang\" (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6\u9577) because that is a clear indicator that the map was made after 1883.\nI guess there is someone at Koryo University who may know about this map, but I think we now know more about it than he or she does. Even the Dokdo Museum could only date<|endoftext|>"

The main beach of Sokcho, coupled with the nearby Seorak Mountain, make Sokcho-si a great tourist destination. The east coast, with its clear water, white sand beaches, and pine forests is particularly renowned for its beauty. Gyeongpo in Gangeung is regarded as one of Korea\u2019s top summer destinations. Its well-preserved traditions, historical relics, and tourist services have made it a popular travel destination. Gangneung is known for its fresh dishes made with quality potatoes, buckwheat, and radish kimchi.\nThe Sea Train is a tourist train, traveling over 58km and connecting Gangneung, Donghae, and Samcheok. Running along the beautiful East Coast, every seat is tailored so passengers can see the ocean. The windows on the Sea Train are larger than those of a regular train, providing passengers with a better view of the majestic waves, elegant beaches, and the emerald-blue ocean. The full course takes approximately one hour and twenty minutes, offering passengers the unique opportunity to enjoy the blue ocean of the East Coast and its colorful personalities that change with every season.\nThere are many farms and ski resorts in Pyeongchang, an area in Korea known for its heavy snows and having the coldest temperatures in the country, but the Sheep Farm there is very special, since the sheep that live there cannot live anywhere else in the country due to the high temperatures. Daegwallyeong Sheep Farm raises sheep on an area of 195\u33a2. The sheep grazing season varies depending on the weather, but it usually begins in early May and lasts until the end of October. Beyond the shack is a 950m high hill where the sheep graze. The cool breeze that blows here, the wide green hill with its roaming sheep, and the blue sky make this a very peaceful experience.\nTour groups begin at 4 people.

Swimming pools and water parks are an option, but the traffic, crowds and overall unpleasant atmosphere are discouraging, to say the least. But why stand in a line for 30 seconds of splashes when you can escape to a natural remedy?\nYachting, kayaking and rafting are just three ways to go off the beaten path and enjoy your summer without bumping shoulders.\nSunbathing in white linens on a luxurious yacht with a pina colada in-hand and Brad Pitt wearing the captain\u2019s hat - not a bad way to spend a summer afternoon.\nYou don\u2019t need to be a millionaire or sailing in the Caribbean to make this fantasy come true (excluding Brad, perhaps). A number of harbor cities around the country offer different types of yacht tours including Jeju Island; Haeundae in Busan; Jeongok Harbor in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi; and Chungmu Marina in Tongyeong, South Gyeongsang.\nOne of the many charms of spending a day on a yacht tour is that you can enjoy the sea with all your senses.  The sound of the waves crashing comes as the cool breeze slips through your fingers.\nThere are two types of yacht tours: public and private. Busan Bexco\u2019s public yacht tour called Yacht B (www.yachtb.co.kr) offers one-hour tours starting from Gwanganri to Haeundae to Dongbaek Island, along Marine City and back to Gwanganri. During the tour, sea fishing, barbecuing on the yacht and foot baths are all available.\nYacht tours get especially popular during the sunset. To catch the view, you can purchase the tour program that starts at 7 or 8:30 p.m.\nPublic tours cost 60,000 won ($53) for adults and 40,000 won for children. A maximum of 29 people, including the skipper, can board the yacht.\nIf you prefer a private session on a yacht, you can rent the whole boat at each of the above-mentioned cities. It can be a little more costly, but if you are planning on a romantic night, you\u2019d have to try pretty hard to screw it up.\nYou can also try skin-scuba diving, swimming and sea fishing on your own private yacht. It costs 500,000 won per hour to rent.\nCanoeing and kayaking are official water sports in the 2012 London Games, but you don\u2019t have to be an Olympic athlete to row down a river or in the ocean.

The \"restinga\" ecosystems are coastal sand dune habitats on the coast of Brazil. Our main hypothesis is that the Squamata fauna composition along these restinga areas would be modulated by habitat structural. After 90 days of field sampling we recorded approximately 5% of reptile species known in Brazil. The composition of Squamata assemblages varied mainly based on the presence or absence of lizards of the genera Ameivula and Tropidurus. Our data showed that habitat structure consistently affected the composition of local Squamata fauna, especially lizards.\nFull Text Available Disturbances such as forest fires, industrial pollution, etc. are almost always heterogeneous, leaving less disturbed patches within the boundaries of disturbances. In addition to the traditionally considered source of soil invertebrates\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 restoration by immigration from the surrounding unchanged biotopes, the role of locally undisturbed areas within the impact zones is shown. The presence of perfugia within the impact areas of various origin is revealed. Perfugia are locally less disturbed or undisturbed areas within a disturbed ecosystem where specimens or remnants of soil biota communities survive a disturbance. They are characterized by higher diversity and abundance of soil fauna in comparison to the main disturbed area. The heterogeneity of soil environment, the heterogeneity of its disturbance and the presence of perfugia serve as one of the factors in the recovery of soil fauna after the disturbances.\nFull Text Available In the present study, insect fauna in forests around Samcheok, Gangwon-do that were designated as regeneration forests, were investigated from August to October in 2012. This study was carried out to collect the basic data on changes in insect fauna by period. The main groups of forest insects including moths, ground beetles, and stem living insects were collected. Bucket traps, pitfall traps, and funnel traps were used in the study. The following results were obtained: 531 individuals in 48 species of moths were investigated by bucket traps; 92 individuals in eight species of ground beetles by pitfall traps; and 17 individuals in nine species of insects by funnel traps.\nFull Text Available ABSTRACT We conducted the present study in Paraty, southeastern Brazil, in areas under different management regimes and plant cover. The study comprised two different agroforestry systems (AFS-1 and AFS-2, a secondary forest, and a cassava monoculture. We aimed at assessing the effects of land use on the soil fauna and its relationship with soil chemical (pH, Al, Ca, Mg, P, K, carbon, and organic matter and microbiological attributes (soil microbial biomass carbon - SMB-C, soil respiration \u00e2\u20ac\u201c SR, metabolic quotient - qCO2, microbial biomass carbon - C-mic. During winter, AFS-2 showed higher abundance of microphagous, saprophagous, and total individuals than the other areas. AFS-1 and the forest showed an increased abundance of Formicidae and phytophagous groups from winter to summer. The soil fauna and community structure showed that the studied agroforests are under regeneration, becoming more similar to the native forest, where ecological processes are considered efficient.\nThe soil fauna communities were described for three dominant vegetation types in a high arctic site at Zackenberg, Northeast Greenland.

A total of 57 species of freshwater fish belonging to 18 families and 39 genera were recorded. However, based on the previous literature it is possible that the Indrayani River harbours around 67 species. Out of the 57 species in the present collection, 12 are endemic to the Western Ghats while six are endemic to the Krishna River system. Neotropius khavalchor, an endemic fish of the Krishna River system, was recorded for the first time from the northern tributaries. The fish fauna of the Indrayani River is threatened due to seven introduced species and anthropogenic activities such as deforestation leading to siltation, tourism, sand mining, over fishing and organic and inorganic pollution. Since the Indrayani River hosts endemic and threatened species, including Glyptothorax poonaensis, conservation measures to ensure habitat protection in the river are essential.\nbiogeographical regions in Europe from the Limnofauna Europaea and used multiple regression analyses to test for correlations between the diversity of definitive (vertebrates) or first intermediate (gastropods) hosts and that of trematodes, and for latitudinal gradients in trematode diversity.

In New Zealand, a shortage of skilled professionals may contribute to or impact on motivation. Using a modified model of Herzberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-factor theory by Smerek and Peterson (2007, this research seeks to answer the question: what motivates New Zealand IT professionals? In response, an online questionnaire was distributed to a population of New Zealand IT professionals and the data analysed using Partial Least Squares to understand the relationship between the various dimensions of job satisfaction, the impact of personal and job characteristics, and turnover intention. The findings show that the New Zealand IT professional is primarily motivated by the nature of his or her work, followed by perceptions of responsibility, and how supervisors encourage an environment for such. Satisfaction with salary is a predictor to a lesser degree. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, professional growth opportunities, career advancement, and recognition do not have a statistically-significant positive association with motivation. We conclude that, to motivate their IT workforce, organizations should: 1 focus on the nature of the jobs that IT professionals undertake; 2 train supervisors to provide an empowering environment; 3 offer competitive salaries to retain top talent; 4 not hesitate to employ IT professionals born outside New Zealand; and 5 take account of the singularities of the New Zealand labour market in seeking to attract, recruit and retain IT professionals.

        "passage": " stretching from the Silla period, through Koryo, and into Joseon has attracted the interest of the academic community.\nFormer head of the Metropolitan Air Quality Management Office and \"Dokdo\" researcher, Seonu Yeong-jun (55), who has recently received a doctorate from Seonggyungwan University, published a book on the 8th entitled, \"Dokdo during the Koryo and Joseon Periods,\" which made public the result of his research on the names of Dokdo and its dominium.\nAccording to the book, the first documentary evidence that both Ulleungdo and Dokdo were Korean land was in the \"History of Koryo,\" when, in the 13th year of King Taejo (930 A.D.), \"Uleungdo\" (\u828b\u9675\u5cf6) appeared. Uleungdo was an abbreviation of \"The Two Islands of Usan/Muleung\" (\u4e8e\u5c71\u6b66\u9675\u4e8c\u5cf6), which was \"one name two island\" (\u4e8c\u5cf6\u4e00\u540d) name for the islands Usanguk (\u4e8e\u5c71\u570b - Ulleungdo) and Muleungdo (\u6b66\u9675\u5cf6).\nDuring the Silla period, the formal name of Ulleungdo and Dokdo was \"The Two Islands of Usan/Muleung,\" which was used together with its abbreviated name \"Uleungdo.\" Dr. Seonu claimed that he has confirmed that the name, \"The Two Islands of Usan/Muleung,\" was used formally in documents, but that \"Uleungdo\" was used in everyday life.\nBefore 512 A.D., the people who set up a country on Ulleungdo were cognizant of \"Dokdo\" and used it as an essential territory. At the time, the concept of \"the two islands were not far apart, so they could be seen on a clear day\" (\u4e8c\u5cf6\u76f8\u8ddd\u4e0d\u9060\u98a8\u65e5\u6df8\u660e\u537d\u53ef\u671b\u898b) was established.\nDr. Seonu said that in 512 A.D. Usanguk became a part of Silla, the name \"Muleungdo\" was formed, and then the written expression \"The two islands of Usan/Muleung are in the sea due east of the hyeon\" was established.\nWhile the name \"Uleungdo\" (\u4e8e\u9675\u5cf6) was used for Ulleungdo and Dokdo in Silla and Usanguk, the name \"Ulleungdo\" started to be used as a dialect in the east coast region of Gangwon. In 1018 A.D., Usanguk fell, and the Gangwondo dialect name also became the commonly used name during the Koryo period.\nDr. Seonu determined that the final name for Ulleungdo and Dokdo went from \"Muleungdo\" (\u6b66\u9675\u5cf6) to \"The Two Islands of Usan/Muleung in the Sea Due East of the Hyeon\" (\u4e8e\u5c71\u6b66\u9675\u4e8c\u5cf6\u5728\u7e23\u6b63\u6771\u6d77\u4e2d), to \"Uleungdo\" (\u4e8e\u9675\u5cf6), to Ulleungdo (\u851a\u9675\u5cf6), to Ulleungdo (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6).\nSince \"Ulleungdo\" (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6) was the very last name for Ulleungdo and Dokdo, it is assumed that when Kim Bu-sik was compiling the Samguksagi, he mistakenly wrote \"Muleungdo\" (\u851a\u9675\u5cf6) as \"Ulleungdo\" (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6).\nOn maps in the latter Joseon, Usando was shown as Ulleungdo's Jukdo (Daetseom), and it is believed that during the time of [King ] Jeongjo and [King] Kojong, the name \"Songjukdo\" [\u677e\u7af9\u5cf6] applied to Dokdo, which demonstrated management and intent.\nDr. Seonu said, \"When you look at the name transition of Dokdo, the possesion of Dokdo was already established during the time of Usanguk and continued unbroken through Silla, Koryo, and Joseon.\" He added, \"Based on international law, Dokdo was never Japanese territory, and Japan only failed in its attempt to make it its territory.\"\nDr. Seonu advocates, \"We need to use Dokdo's original name of \"Muleung\" as a basis and compose a 'Muleungdwon' [Muleungdo Garden?] using Dokdo and ecological technology. Then we have to occasionally promote a plan that uses 'a place of dreams and romance.'\"\nFrom \"Korea and Her Neighbors\" by Isabella Lucy Bird.\n1904 February 20th Japanese map of Korea and Manch...\n1736 ~ 1767 - Yeojido (\u8f3f\u5730\u5716) - Ulleung/Usan (\u9b31\u9675\u4e8e\u5c71\u5169\u5cf6...\n1794 June 3 - Han Chang-guk (\u97d3\u660c\u570b) Inspects Ulleung...\n1786 June 4 - Kim Chang-yun (\u91d1\u660c\u80e4) Inspects Ulleung...\n1863 - Description of Ulleungdo from Kim Jeong-ho'...\n1807 May 12 - Lee Tae-gun (\u674e\u6cf0\u6839) Inspects Ulleungdo...\n1827 May 19 - Ha Si-myeong (\u6cb3\u59cb\u660e) Inspects Ulleungd...\n1831 May 14 - Lee Gyeong-jeong (\u674e\u6176\u9f0e) Inspects Ulle...\n1905 January 28th: Cabinet Decision to Incorporat...\nMid 1700s - \"Paldo Yeojido\" (\u516b\u9053\u8f3f\u5730\u5716) - Ulleungdo Ma...\nKorean Scholar Says \"Usando\" Was Ulleungdo's \"Jukd...\nFrom \"Korea and Her Neighbors\" by Isabella Lucy Bi...\n1900 Oct 27 - Imperial Edict Makes Ulleungdo a Cou...\n1888 - 1895 - Map of Samcheok District & Ulleungdo...<|endoftext|>"

When exposed to sunshine, the human body creates serotonin which is effective in relaxing the brain and contributes to feelings of well-being and happiness. Phytoncides and their refreshing scents given off by plants stimulate the human central nervous system to relieve tension and stabilize the body and mind. Nature seems to be the most important thing for both physical and mental health.\nAs we enter into the winter months, the Korea Forest Service came up with six recommendations of recreational forests good for visiting in winter. The six destinations share one thing in common: they are where people can enjoy everything that both forests and romantic winter seas have to offer.\nDaegwallyeong Recreation Forest located in Gangneung, Gangwon-do (Gangwon Province) is the nation\u2019s first forest built for recreational purposes.  Some of the trees, grown from seeds artificially sown from 1922 to 1928, are of high academic value. The forest has a lot to offer for travelers: forest trails, botanical gardens, straw-thatched cottages in red clay, waterwheels and charcoal kilns. A pavilion overlooking the forest offers a wonderful panoramic view of Gyeongpodae Beach on the East Sea.\nGeombongsan Recreation Forest in Samcheok, Gangwon-do is one of the most popular sites for mountain biking enthusiasts. The magnificent ridgeline stretching out toward Yukbaeksan Mountain has posed a challenge for numerous mountain bikers. Standing on the peak of Geombongsan Mountain, you can get a beautiful view of the boundless open sea to the east and the tall Sageumsan Mountain (1,092 meters) to the west.

In Odontobutis species, the three species showed the diploid chromosome number, 2n=44 (NF=44) telocentric chromosomes. In Cottus species, the mitotic chromosomes from 24 groups with two chromosomes each indicated that it is a diploid. The karyotype of C. koreanus and C. hangiongensis is 2n=48 and NF=52. These species is the first report on the chromosomes and the karyotype analysis except O. platycephala. Our findings provide cytotaxonomic evidence for the species distinctness of these five species whose descriptions were based primarily on external morphology.\nThree specimens of a small sculpin, Icelinus japonicus, were collected from the midwestern coastal waters of the Korean Peninsula firstly. The species is characterized by having two ctenoid scale rows extending posterior end of the second dorsal fin along the dorso-lateral surface of the body, pelvic fin with a spine and two soft rays, and teeth on vomer and palatines. A new Korean name, \"Du-jul-bil-neul-hoes-dae\", is proposed for the species.\nA three specimen of Icelus toyamensis, belonging to Cottidae, Scorpaeniformes, was firstly collected from the East Sea, Korea during 2007-2009. We herein described the species as the first record from Korea on the basis of these specimens. Icelus toyamensis is characterized by the following morphological combinations: spinous scales absent on the base of dorsal fin; small ctenoid scales scattered on body sides; gill rakers are short, tubular, and relatively broad; the uppermost preopercular spine is sharp and simple; dorsal fin rays VIII-IX, 20-21; anal fin soft rays 18-19; pectoral fin rays 18, and vertebrae 40-41. New Korean name of I. toyamensis is proposed as \"Min-jul-ga-si-hoet-dae.\"\nSixteen specimens of Artediellus fuscimentus, belonging to the family Cottidae, were collected from the coastal waters off Samcheok and Donghae, Korea, in December 2010 and February 2015, respectively.  We also analyzed 600 base pairs of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b sequence to confirm the taxonomic status of the specimens. The sequences of our specimens corresponded completely to those of Japanese A. fuscimentus, but differed from those of A. atlanticus (d=0.057~0.061). We propose the new Korean names \"Eom-ji-hoet-dae-sok\" for the genus Artediellus and \"Eom-ji-hoet-dae\" for the species A. fuscimentus.\nFour specimens (114.2~134.2 mm SL) of Icelus stenosomus Andriashev, family Cottidae, were collected from Goseong-gun, Gangwon-do, East Sea of Korea.

European countries have overhauled their policies toward Russia, the Washington Post noted. They banned Russian-controlled media in the European Union, enacted tough sanctions on Russian institutions and, perhaps most importantly, spent EU funds to give Ukraine weapons.\nAdditionally, Poland, Bulgaria and Slovakia are working on giving their Russian-made fighter jets to Ukraine \u2013 a potential game-changer in the country\u2019s fight against Russia. As NBC News noted, they want assurances that the US will allow them to buy modern American jets to replace the ones they lose, however.\nEven neutral countries like Finland and Sweden are getting into the act. NATO leaders are now including the two countries in their deliberations, according to Defense News. More than half of the Finnish public and more than 40 percent of Swedes now support joining the alliance. Neutral Switzerland, meanwhile, has joined the US and EU in imposing economic sanctions on Russian elites, Radio France Internationale reported.\nPerhaps Putin has effectuated a self-fulfilling prophecy regarding a Europe unified against his homeland, the Los Angeles Times claimed. The Encyclopedia Britannica defined the psychology behind the concept as an \u201coriginally false expectation [that] leads to its own confirmation.\u201d The idea is that Putin prophesized European aggression, took actions to counter it in Ukraine and thereby forced Europeans to become more aggressive, fulfilling his worst fears.\nBritish journalist Peter Hitchens would disagree. Writing in the Daily Mail, he argued that such analyses ignore the West\u2019s and Ukraine\u2019s role in ratcheting up tensions with Russia over the years.\nEither way, the possibility of World War III in Europe is more real than ever. Putin has described economic sanctions as the equivalent to \u201cdeclaring war,\u201d noted National Public Radio. Calls for a Western-imposed no-fly zone over Ukraine, for example, could force Russian jets to fight NATO jets in the sky over the country, warned Jacobin, a leftist magazine.\nThe Russian president might be assuming that Europe won\u2019t spark a war in order to defeat aggression, violence and authoritarianism. He could be wrong. But he also might be harboring a death wish.\nA global anti-money laundering watchdog placed the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on its \u201cgray list\u201d over concerns that the Gulf country has not taken enough steps to curb illegal financial activities, CNBC reported.\nThe French-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) said that the UAE was subject to increased monitoring because of \u201cstrategic deficiencies\u201d in its attempts to counter money laundering. Still, it acknowledged that the country had made efforts to thwart money laundering and terrorism financing.\nThe designation places the Gulf nation on a list of 22 others including Syria, Albania, and Panama. The watchdog said the \u201cgray list\u201d is not as severe as the \u201cblacklist,\u201d which includes Iran and North Korea.\nThe Emirates is the financial hub of the Middle East and hosts many international companies\u2019 headquarters. But the UAE also has a reputation for being an easy place to move large sums of cash in and out of the country and lax inspection in certain sectors, such as real estate deals, according to the Financial Times.\nThe inclusion in the list will impact the UAE\u2019s reputation as a global financial hub, although Gulf-based bankers noted that the move will not stop financial institutions looking to set up in the country.\nSouth Korean firefighters and troops battled a large wildfire over the weekend that tore through the country\u2019s eastern coastal area, forcing thousands to evacuate and threatening two energy facilities in the region, the Associated Press reported.\nThe fire began Friday morning near the seaside town of Uljin and spread across more than 14,800 acres to the nearby city of Samcheok. More than 6,200 people have been evacuated and at least 159 homes and 46 other buildings have been destroyed.\nThe government deployed about 7,000 firefighters, troops and public workers, as well as 65 helicopters and more than 500 vehicles to contain the blaze.\nThe wildfire also threatened to spread to a liquid natural gas production facility and a nuclear power plant near Uljin but authorities were able to prevent the blaze from hitting them.\nSo far, no casualties have been reported. Officials said they are investigating the cause of the blaze.\nThe disaster comes just before South Korea holds its presidential elections, Bloomberg noted, adding to a growing number of stressors: Weeks before the March 9 polls, neighboring North Korea has been conducting various missile tests, including suspected ballistic missiles.\nChile will create a large national park to protect the country\u2019s hundreds of glaciers melting because of climate change, Agence France-Presse reported.\nThe new National Glacier Park will cover more than 185,000 acres of the Andes mountain about 40 miles from the capital, Santiago.\nOutgoing President Sebastian Pinera hailed the park as \u201ca fundamental step that our country is taking to combat the destruction of nature.\u201d He said the initiative will protect 368 glaciers, as well as preserve species native to the region, such as pumas and foxes.\nThe president added that the glaciers hold 32 times more water than the reservoir that serves Santiago\u2019s seven million population.\nThe park\u2019s establishment comes amid global concern that the warming climate is melting glaciers around the world. A study by the University of Chile found that glaciers in the central part of the country \u2013 where the park is also located \u2013 are shrinking because of global warming.\nChile ranks among the top 10 nations in the world in terms of glacier surface area. The list also includes Canada, the United States, China and Russia.\nA second day of attempted evacuations of residents of the besieged southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol failed Sunday as both Russia and Ukraine accused each other of violating a ceasefire agreement, Reuters reported. And as Russian forces continued to bomb Ukrainian cities \u2013 and target civilians, according to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken \u2013 world leaders began raising questions of Russian war crimes. Meanwhile, Ukraine is set to ask the United Nations\u2019 highest court Monday to stop Russia\u2019s invasion \u2013 the International Court of Justice adjudicates legal disputes between states. Separately, Ukraine is dispatching teams to bombed sites to gather evidence of possible war crimes at another international tribunal.\nRussian police detained more than 4,500 people in 49 cities across Russia who were protesting against Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Al Jazeera noted. The Kremlin has also blocked social media platforms Facebook and Twitter in the country over alleged \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against Russian media, CBS News reported. Meanwhile, major western media outlets such as Bloomberg and the BBC and social media companies such as TikTok pulled out of Russia because of a draconian new media censorship law.\nThe United Nations estimated that more than 360 civilians have been killed in Ukraine, although Ukrainian officials put the death toll at more than 2,000 civilians, the Washington Post wrote. Meanwhile, the UN said about 1.5 million have fled the country, describing the exodus as the fastest and largest displacement of people in Europe since World War II, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nMore than 500 Russian soldiers have been killed and about 1,600 injured during Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Among the dead are three Russian generals, including Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky, a top figure in the Russian military, the Independent reported.\nThe United States and Poland are considering providing Soviet-era fighter jets to Ukraine to fend off invading Russian forces, NBC News wrote. Meanwhile, NATO and other Western officials have refused to establish a \u201cno-fly\u201d zone over Ukraine, citing fears that such a move would exacerbate the conflict, Politico noted. Russia said Sunday that countries hosting Ukrainian combat aircraft could be viewed by Moscow as parties to the conflict.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "The mitochondrial genome of Tremoctopus violaceus (Octopoda, Tremoctopodidae) and its phylogenetic consideration\n\nThe complete mitochondrial genome of Tremoctopus violaceus was sequenced to analyze its organization and phylogenetic status within the order Octopoda. The mitochondrial genome of T. violaceus had a structure and organization similar to that of other Octopoda. The content of the nucleotides A, C, G, and T was 31.68 %, 7.71 %, 20.02 %, and 40.58 %, respectively. All protein-coding genes (PCG) began with the ATG codon, excluding ND4 and ATP6, which began with ATC and ATT, respectively, and terminated with TAG, TAA, TA, or T. Codons for isoleucine were the most used codons, whereas those for arginine were used the least. Two extra tRNAs, trnN and trnL, were found in the control region. These tRNAs have a D-armless structure. The control region had excess A + T content (83.16 %) and a stem-loop structure with two elements, which is reported for the first time in Octopoda by our study. Bayesian inference using 13 PCG revealed that Octopus and Octopodidae were polyphyletic, and that Tremoctopodidae diverged relatively earlier within Octopoda. The mitochondrial genome of T. violaceus and its characteristics may help to understand the evolutionary history of Octopoda and establish a marine biodiversity conservation strategy.\n\nIn East Asia, the presence of T. violaceus has been recorded in the coastal waters of Japan and the nearby South China Sea (Georeferenced records in GBIF, https://www.gbif.org), as well as on the shore of Samcheok-si, Kangwon-do, South Korea in 2019. Specimens of T. violaceus are very rarely collected in East Asia; therefore, its distribution status, dispersing history, and phylogenetic relationships with populations found in other regions are unclear. Ever since the mitochondrial (mt) genome of Octopus vulgaris was first reported (Yokobori et al., 2004), complete mt genomes of over 20 Octopoda species have been reported. Most animal mt genomes generally have a compact size (14-19 kb), circular form, and comprise 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 tRNAs, two rRNAs, and a noncoding control region (Boore, 1999). The mt genome has been used for identifying species, tracking evolutionary history, and making inferences related to comparative genomics from nucleotide composition, structural features, and gene rearrangement, etc. (Boore, 1999;Kumazawa et al., 1996;Li et al., 2016;Yu et al., 2019). Molecular phylogeny performed using mt genomes is useful for resolving controversial evolutionary relationships among various animal groups. Uribe & Zardoya (2017) revisited the phylogeny of Cephalopoda using complete mt genomes, and suggested that Octopus and Octopodidae are polyphyletic, as reported in previous studies (Cheng et al., 2013;Magall\u00f3n-Gay\u00f3n et al., 2020).\nRecently, the importance of biodiversity has led to worldwide attention because biodiversity affects ecosystem functions (Baert et al., 2018;Isbell et al., 2018;O'Connor et al. 2017). Biodiversity is highly threatened by climate change, therefore, many advanced countries are making a lot of efforts to preserve global biodiversity through the Nagoya protocol, etc. Research on biodiversity begins with identifying species, and genetic analysis methods are widely used as a tool to identify species and analyze phylogenetic relationships (Chen & Wang, 2021;Yi et al., 2021).\nThis study presents the sequencing of the complete mt genome of T. violaceus and the description of the T. violaceus mt genome organization and phylogenetic analysis using the mt 13 PCG sequences that are generally found in species of the Octopoda.\n\nDNA extraction and mitochondrial genome sequencing\nOur study was performed using a T. violaceus specimen caught by a fisherman in the sea near the Jeju east pier, and donated for research. Genomic DNA was extracted from a small piece of muscle using a Nucleospin Tissue Kit (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The complete mt genome was amplified and sequenced using newly designed primers, including nested primers for primer walking sequencing. All sequencing reactions were conducted at Bionics (Seoul, Korea).\n\nGene annotation and sequence analysis\nThe complete mt genome was annotated using MITOS (Bernt et al., 2013) and ORF Finder (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ orffinder) using the invertebrate mitochondrial code. The complete mt genome map was drawn using SnapGene 5 software. The codon usage of 13 PCGs was analyzed using MEGA X (Kumar et al., 2018). The tRNA genes were identified using webbased tRNAscan-SE software (Lowe & Eddy, 1997) and ARW-EN (Laslett & Canb\u00e4ck, 2008).\n\nPhylogenetic analysis\nTo reconstruct the phylogenetic tree within the Octopoda, previously reported mt genomes of species in Octopoda were collected from the GenBank database and 13 PCG sequences were aligned using Clustal X (Thompson et al., 1997) with default settings. Bayesian inference (BI) performed using MrBayes 3.2 software (Ronquist et al., 2012) was used for phylogenetic tree reconstruction. The GTR + G + I model was selected as the best evolutionary model using jmodeltest2 (Darriba et al., 2012). Four Markov chains were run for 100,000 generations and sampled every 100 generations to obtain a posterior probability (PP) distribution of 1,000 trees. Vampyroteuthis infernalis (AB266515) was used as the outgroup (Uribe & Zardoya, 2017).\nAs observed in other animals, the mt genome of T. violaceus has 13 PCGs encoded on the heavy and the light strand. NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1), ND6, cytochrome b, ND4L, ND4, and ND5 were encoded on the heavy strand and\n\nFisheries and Aquatic Sciences\nThe total number of codons used in the 13 PCGs was 3,750, wherein codons corresponding to trnI were the most used (257 times), while codons for trnR were used the least (three times) ( Table 2). Among the 3,750 codons, the proportion of codons for trnL was 15.2 % (571/3,750, the most used codon), whereas that for trnR was 1.3 % (50/3,750, the least used codon). trnL and trnS were coded by six and eight different codons, respectively. trnA, trnR, trnG, trnP, trnT, and trnV were coded by four different cod<|endoftext|>"

He\u2019s sprawled out on his back, deep in slumber.\nNow maybe normally, if we were at home, I\u2019d just make myself go to sleep. We\u2019d both have long days to face ahead of us\u2014him, with his work running a hostel and me with mine of teaching English to elementary kids. We\u2019d need our energy, which means we\u2019d need our sleep.\nBut this isn\u2019t normally. We\u2019re on day two of a four-day holiday, and that means we can use our energy and how we choose to. Either tomorrow \u2026 or tonight.\nSo I start to give him head.\nI remember years ago, a boyfriend I had asked me why I never woke him up for sex. The thought had genuinely never occurred to me before, and while I could see where he was coming from, I didn\u2019t see its appeal.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want him waking me up for sex,\u201d I thought. So I just did what I do in those situations and agreed with him while simultaneously shoving that in the \u201cthings I\u2019ll never do\u201d mental file.\nBut tonight, some nine years later, I pick up that thought and move it to my \u201cgood ideas\u201d file. Yes, this is excellent. And I can tell by the way he\u2019s moving under me that he agrees.\nI haven\u2019t had a lot of serious boyfriends in my life and over the years, I\u2019ve become really stingy with how I spend my time. I often make it a priority to share any special moments (like holidays, birthdays, or trips), with friends and not guys I\u2019m seeing so that later, those memories are about times I spent with friends\u2014not about how Johnny X came/didn\u2019t come through.\nSo this is the first time in years and years that I\u2019m spending a getaway with a boyfriend. I was apprehensive at first\u2014I know travelling with a significant other can sometimes result in Richter-scale level fights, and I just assumed those fights would find me and him.\nBut this trip has been nothing like that. Instead, getting away and getting out of the context of our normal lives has shown me how well we reinforce each other. He\u2019s been like my backbone and mind reader this trip. We travelled to Samcheok, a beach in Korea 3 hours east of Seoul, with 2 other couples, and he and I have never been more in tune. When someone suggests something we\u2019re not into, we only need to look at each other\u2014and then he speaks up.\nThese are my friends, so he\u2019s agreed to take the loss and be the disagreeable one so I can keep the group harmony (and I didn\u2019t even have to ask).\n\nGoing on a mini-vacation together showed me that I picked a partner who is well-suited to me and we flow well as a couple. It not only spiced up our sex, but also reinforced our mental and emotional connection. For couples who are considering traveling together or experiencing a little bit of a lag, I definitely recommend a mini-vacation as a way to spice things up/see your relationship more clearly.\nTwo things occupy the top spot on the list of things Bryoney cares most about: food, and feminism.

The province is also crossed by the 145-km-long Military Demarcation Line (MDL), which starts at 38\u00b045' north latitude, in Hyeonnae-myeon in Goseong-gun to the southwest, to a site at 38\u00b020' north latitude linking Hyangnobong Peak, Mondong-ri and Gimhwa-eup. Gangwon-do is 150 km wide, from east to west, and 243 km long, from north to south, and has an eastern coastline of about 314 km. The province is bordered by five provinces, three cities and 13 counties, including Singye-gun and Gimcheon-gun in Hwanghae-do; Yeoncheon, Pocheon, Gapyeong, Yangpyeong and Yeoju in Gyeonggi-do in the east; Chungju-si, Jecheon-si and Danyang-gun in Chungcheongbuk-do and Yeongju-si, Bonghwa-gun and Uljin-gun in Gyeongsangbuk-do in the south; and Anbyeon-gun and Deogwon-gun in Hamgyeongnam-do and Goksan-gun in Hwanghae-do in the north.\nThe total area of Gangwon-do is 20,569Km\u00b2 of which the area south of the MDL is 16,873.51\u33a2, which accounts for 82% of the province's total area and 16.8% of the national territory of South Korea.\nThe total area of Gangwon-do is 20,569Km\u00b2 of which the area south of the MDL is 16,873.51\u33a2, which accounts for 82% of the province's total area and 16.8% of the national territory of South Korea. The province consists of the mountainous areas covering 81.0% of the total provincial area, including 13,665.66Km\u00b2 and farming fields of 1,668.69Km\u00b2, which accounts for 9.9%, and land for other purposes covering 9.1% of the total area, with 1,539.25Km\u00b2.\nGangwon-do is a mountainous province, (a much greater part is occupied by mountains)and is usually divided into two areas, Yeongdong and Yeongseo, with the Taebaek Mountains, which form the backbone of the Korean Peninsula, in the middle.\nThe area east of the Taebaek Mountains is marked by steep slopes with few coastal plains, while the western area is marked by gentle slopes and mountains containing the headwaters of some of Korea's largest rivers, such as the Namhan and Bukhan Rivers.\nThe percentage of low land (less than 100 meters high) covers only 5.6% of the total area of Gangwon-do, which is even lower than that of Hamgyeongnam-do where the figure is 9.6%. Low hills between 100-500 meters in height cover 43.1%; mid-height land between 500-1,000 meters covers 43.4%, a larger figure than for all the other provinces in Korea; and, finally, highlands taller than 1,000 meters cover 7.7%. Flat, arable land for paddy cultivation is largely located along the eastern coastal area around Gangneung and Bukpyeong and is distributed around Cheorwon, Chuncheon and Wonju in the Yeongbuk area. The northern part of the river basins feature steep valleys.\nThe Yeongdong area is geographically narrow due to the steep mountains facing the East Sea, but it contains several high scenic passes, such as Daegwallyeong, Misiryeong, Jinburyeong and Hangyeryeong, and deep valleys. The Yeongseo area features mountains and sunken lands all running gently towards Seoul and surrounding Gyeonggi-do in the west, and expansive highlands that offer dry fields rather than paddies and contain headwaters that flow into many streams and two of Korea's largest rivers, the Han River and Nakdong River, that wet a large part of the Korean Peninsula. The upper streams of the Bukhan River provide habitats for various fish species, including some of the rarest Korean native fish, and form well protected healthy ecosystems. There are in the area several famous dams: the Peace Dam, Hwacheon Dam, Chuncheon Dam, Soyang River Dam and Uiam Dam that supply an ample amount of water for Korean industries and daily life.\nGangwon-do is located in the medium-latitude temperate zone between 37\u00b0 and 38\u00b0 north latitude.\nLocated in the medium-latitude temperate zone between 37\u00b0 and 38\u00b0 north latitude, Gangwon-do's climate is characterized by high temperatures and humidity during the summer and coldness and dryness in the winter. This is due to the high continental pressure which is low in temperature and humidity.\nGangwon-do is geographically divided into two areas, Yeongdong and Yeongseo, by the Taebaek Mountains as they stretch from north to south along the east of the Korean Peninsula. Both areas feature remarkably different climatic conditions.\nAs for the general characteristics of the province's climate, the Yeongdong area, in which steep mountain slopes are directly connected with the coasts, displays elements of an oceanic climate whereas the Yeongseo area, located in the middle of the Korean Peninsula, shows characteristic elements comparable to those of a continental climate. Meanwhile, the highlands of the Taebaek Mountains exhibit characteristic features of a mountain climate.\nThe Yeongdong area has a few paddy fields because of the steep mountain slopes running downwards and directly into the sea, thus leaving only a limited area of paddy fields lying along some parts of the coastline. Such geographical features of the area create a comparatively warmer winter and cooler summer, with a low annual temperature range.\nThe annual mean temperature in the Yeongdong area is higher than that of the Yeongseo area by 2\u00b0 C. The annual precipitation rates in the two areas are 2,058.5mm and 1,690.3mm, respectively, showing that Gangwon-do's eastern part, including Gangneung, Sokcho and Samcheok, has more rainfall (by about 370 mm annually) than the western part, which includes Chuncheon, Wonju and Cheorwon. In the winter and spring the province tends to have stronger winds than in other provinces. There is also more snow in winter. In January and February the Yeongdong area, in particular, tends to have a much heavier snowfall than the rest of the entire country.<|endoftext|>"

For the county in North Chungcheong, see Yeongdong County.\nYeongdong (Korean pronunciation: [j\u028c\u014b.do\u014b], Korean pronunciation: [\u027ej\u0254\u014b.d\u0264\u014b], literally 'east of the passes') is the eastern, coastal region of Gangwon Province, South Korea and Kangw\u014fn Province, North Korea. It is divided from the inland Yeongseo region by the Taebaek Mountains.\nAlthough Yeongseo describes the western half of the two provinces and Gwandong describes both halves together, \"Yeongdong\" is used much more frequently in South Korea than either of the other two names, and may be taken loosely to refer to the entire region.\nThe region's name lends itself to the Yeongdong Railway Line and Yeongdong Expressway, which are major transportation corridors connecting Seoul to Gangwon.\nThis Korea location article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.\nGangneung is a municipal city in the province of Gangwon-do, on the east coast of South Korea. It has a population of 213,658. Gangneung is the economic centre of the Yeongdong region of Gangwon-do. Gangneung has many tourist attractions, such as Jeongdongjin, a very popular area for watching the sun rise, and Gyeongpo Beach. There is an ROKAF airbase south of downtown Gangneung that formerly doubled as a civil airport.\nGangwon-do is a province of South Korea, with its capital at Chuncheon. It is bounded on the east part by the Sea of Japan, and borders Gyeonggi Province to its west, and North Gyeongsang Province and North Chungcheong Province to its south. Its northern boundary is the Military Demarcation Line, separating it from North Korea's Kangw\u014fn Province. Before the division of Korea in 1945 Gangwon and Kangw\u014fn formed a single province. Pyeongchang County hosted the 2018 Winter Olympics and 2018 Winter Paralympics. Gangwon will host the 2024 Winter Youth Olympics.\nGyeongsang was one of the eight provinces of Korea during the Joseon dynasty. Gyeongsang was located in the southeast of Korea.\nDonghae is a city in Gangwon Province, South Korea. There are two major ports: Donghae Harbor and Mukho Harbor. The city is located on the Yeongdong Line railroad and the Donghae Expressway. Numerous caverns are found in the city, as in neighboring Samcheok. Hanzhong University is located here.\nPyeongchang is a county in the province of Gangwon-do, South Korea, located in the Taebaek Mountains region. It is home to several Buddhist temples, including Woljeongsa. It is about 180 km (110 mi) east southeast of Seoul, the capital of South Korea, and connected by expressways and high-speed passenger railways. Pyeongchang's slogan, \"Happy 700 Pyeongchang\", is taken from its average elevation of approximately 700 metres (2,300 ft).\nYeongnam is a region that coincides with the former Gyeongsang Province in what is now South Korea.\nA number of Korean dialects are spoken on the Korean Peninsula. The peninsula is extremely mountainous and each dialect's \"territory\" corresponds closely to the natural boundaries between different geographical regions of Korea. Most of the dialects are named for one of the traditional Eight Provinces of Korea. One is sufficiently distinct from the others to be considered a separate language, the Jeju language.\nThe Yeongdong Line is a line of Korail. It connects Yeongju in North Gyeongsang Province with Gangneung in Gangwon Province. From Yeongju, it crosses the Taebaek Mountains and reaches the Sea of Japan at Donghae, thence proceeding north to Gangneung.\nMukho is a harbor in Donghae City, Gangwon Province, South Korea. It is located on the shore of the East Sea. In the past it played an important role in the shipping of iron ore and coal; much of this role has been taken over by Donghae Harbor in recent years. Mukho is an important harbor of refuge and home to a large number of fishing vessels. A passenger ferry operates from the port to Ulleung Island. The harbor is connected to land-based transportation by two stations on the Yeongdong Line and an interchange on the Donghae Expressway. The ship Mangyongbong 92 carrying a 140 person delegation for the 2018 Winter Olympics from North Korea berthed at this harbor, as protesters opposing North Korea subsequently gathered singing Aegukga. The harbor first opened in 1941.\nGangwon Province or Gangwon-do was one of the Eight Provinces of Korea during the Joseon Dynasty. The province was formed in 1395, and derived its name from the names of the principal cities of Gangneung and the provincial capital Wonju.\nThis is a partial list of Korea-related topics beginning with Y.\nSangji University (\uc0c1\uc9c0\ub300\ud559\uad50) is a private university located in Wonju, Gangwon Province, South Korea. Established in 1955, it has seven colleges and six graduate schools. Its top areas of study are Oriental Medicine and Tourism. The Sangji Foundation also manages Sangji Yeongseo College and Sangji Girls Middle and High Schools.\nDaegwallyeong is a mountain pass in the Taebaek Mountains of eastern South Korea. It runs between Pyeongchang and Gangneung in Gangwon Province. It rises to 832 metres (2,730 ft) above sea level. It is an important historical pass that connects the regions of Yeongseo and Yeongdong. Daegwallyeong-myeon of Pyeongchang County is named after this pass. Daegwallyeong Museum is located in Gangneung.\nDonghae station is a railway station in Donghae City in Gangwon Province, South Korea. Donghae station is on the Yeongdong Line, the Samcheok Line, the Mukhohang Line, and the Bukpyeong Line.\nThe Gangwon dialect is spoken in South Korea's Gangwon Province and in North Korea's Kangw\u014fn Province. Although they are large provinces by area, relatively few people lived in the Gangwon Province. As a result, people living in the western side of Gangwon (Yeongseo) did not develop a highly distinctive dialect. However, the part of Gang<|endoftext|>"

The fire safety technology center will research and develop efficient extinguishing systems for fires lit by large-capacity secondary batteries, also known as rechargeable batteries, used in energy storage systems. Battery fires are devastating and hard to put out. During the last few years, South Korea's emergency workers adopted fire-proof blankets to cover and suffocate electric vehicle fires.\nAn energy storage system (ESS) is an integrated system of secondary battery packs. It is normally connected to a renewable energy source such as a solar power plant or a wind farm to collect electricity and provide power to nearby towns' power grids or sell electricity back to power companies. South Korea has some 2,300 energy storage system (ESS) facilities operated by private and state power companies as of July 2020 and about 30 of them have been damaged by fire and left inoperable. According to Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO), 30,232 megawatt-hours of electricity worth 6.5 billion won was lost as of 2019.\nSouth Korea has been focusing on various fire suppression methods to extinguish fire caused by batteries. Samsung SDI, the battery-making unit of tech giant Samsung Electronics, has developed a special fire extinguishing system for facilities that store electricity generated by clean energy power plants in 2019. When an ESS' interior catches fire and its temperature reaches a certain degree, special chemicals are automatically sprayed to extinguish the initial flame.\nSamcheok said in a statement on October 27 that the city started the construction of a fire safety verification center with a total width of 6,000 square meters. A 30 megawatt-class fire calorimeter and a large fire extinguishing performance test device will be used at the facility. The center will be built by August 2022. \"Samcheok will be reborn as South Korea's top energy and disaster suppression city,\" Samcheok Mayor Kim Yang-ho was quoted as saying. According to Kim, the size of South Korea's medium and large ESS test and certification market is about 10 billion won.<|endoftext|>"

The parasites transmitted by Haemaphysalis spp. are Theileria spp., Babesia spp., and Hepatozoon spp. which likewise cause the following diseases, respectively: tropical theileriosis and sheep theilerosis; cattle, dog, and sheep babesiosis; and hepatozoonosis [7].\nDespite the importance of H. longicornis as an important pathogen vector, little is known regarding its microbiome. In this study, we employed high-throughput sequencing of the V3\u2013V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene to investigate the bacterial abundance and diversity between the nymph stage and the adult developmental stages of H. longicornis to evaluate the changes in the bacterial abundance and the maintenance of the bacterial community throughout the life cycle of the tick.\nTicks were collected within a radius of 50 m from vegetation (geographical location: 37.323366/129.233736) by flagging in Samcheok, Gangwon-do Province, Korea, in June 2020. Species identification of the collected ticks was performed by examination under a dissecting microscope, according to Yamaguti et al. [8]. Among the 140 H. longicornis obtained, 11 nymphs, 3 female adults, and 4 male adults were randomly selected for microbiome study.\nThe surface of each tick was sterilized using alcohol before DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from individual ticks using a NucleoSpin DNA Insect kit (Macherey\u2013Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nThe V3\u2013V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR using the following bacterial universal primer pair: forward primer, 5\u2032-TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3\u2032 and reverse primer, 5\u2032-GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3\u2032 [9]. A limited-cycle amplification step was performed to add multiplexing indices and Illumina sequencing adapters. The libraries were normalized, pooled, and sequenced using the MiSeq platform (600 cycles, Illumina MiSeq V3 cartridge; Illumina, San Diego, California, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nBioinformatic analyses were performed as described by Kim et al. [9]. Raw reads were processed through a quality check, and low-quality (Q <25) reads were filtered using Trimmomatic 0.32 [10]. Paired-end sequence data were then merged using PandaSeq [11]. Primers were trimmed using the ChunLab in-house program (ChunLab, Inc., Seoul, Korea), applying a similarity cut-off of 0.8. Sequences were denoised using the Mothur pre-clustering program, which merges sequences and extracts unique sequences, allowing up to 2 differences between sequences [12]. The EzBioCloud database [13] was used for taxonomic assignment using BLAST 2.2.22 [14], and pairwise alignments were generated to calculate similarity [15]. The UCHIME algorithm and non-chimeric 16S rRNA database from EzBioCloud were used to detect chimeric sequences for reads with a best hit similarity rate of <97% [16]. Sequence data were then clustered using CD-Hit and UCLUST [17,18]. All of the abovementioned analyses were performed with EzBioCloud, a commercially available ChunLab bioinformatics cloud platform for microbiome research (https://www.ezbiocloud.net/). The reads were normalized to 10,000 to perform the analyses. We computed the Shannon index [19], unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) clustering [20], and principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) [21] based on the generalized UniFrac distance [22]. We used the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test to test for differences in the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and used the Shannon index to compare microbiome diversity between the 2 age groups. We used linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis to identify significantly different taxa [23]. Swarm plot was created by the beeswarm package in R software (version 4.0.5).\nFor H. longicornis nymph, female adult, and male adult ticks, the average reads assigned to bacteria were 35,622, 59,365, and 51,859, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). The number of OTUs, which reflects species richness, was not significantly different between the groups (Fig. 1A, B; Supplementary Table S1). The Shannon index, which reflects species diversity, was significantly higher for nymphs (n=11) than the adult ticks (both males and females, n=7; P=0.026; Fig. 1C). However, it did not differ significantly among the 3 groups, and the average Shannon indices were 1.55, 0.83, and 0.78 for nymphs (n=11), female adults (n=3), and male adult (n=4) ticks, respectively (Fig. 1D; Supplementary Table S1).\nBeta diversity was analyzed to show the difference in bacterial composition between the samples. First, the PCoA result showed that the samples of the male adult group and those of the female adult group clustered well (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the bacterial composition of the 2 groups was different. In contrast, nymph samples were relatively scattered in the plot versus the other groups. Similarly, in UPGMA clustering, the male adult and female adult samples were clustered closely among their groups than the nymph samples.\nIn the composition, the most predominant bacterial species was Pseudomonas fulva, which was found in all ticks evaluated in this study with an average relative abundance of 48.9% (Fig. 3A, B). The second most abundant species was Coxiella-like bacterium (AB001519), a known tick endosymbiont [24], with an average relative abundance of 20.7% (Fig. 3A). Coxiella-like bacterium (AB001519) was found in all nymphs and female adult ticks although some nymph samples showed very few reads for this species (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Table S2). In contrast, among the 4 male adult tick samples, Coxiella-like bacterium (AB001519) was found in only one sample with 0.7% relative abundance (Fig. 3B). Relative abundance of Corynebacterium spp., including C. falsenii, C. xerosis, and C. resistens was more than 40% in 4 nymphs (N8, N9, N10, and N11) but it was not detected in other samples (Fig. 3B).\nTo identify significant differences in bacterial abundance between the nymph, female adult, and female adult ticks, we performed LEfSe analysis. The LDA scores for Coxiella-like bacterium (AB001519) was 4.88 and its average relative abundance was 66.4% in female adult ticks, 15.7% in nymphs, and 0.2% in male adult ticks (Table 1; Fig. 4A). The LDA score for P. fulva was 4.79 and its relative abundance was the highest in male adult ticks (86.9%, Fig. 4B). The LDA score for P. fluorescens was 3.51 and its relative abundance was the highest in male adult ticks (4.0%, Fig. 4C).\nKnown pathogenic species were also identified. Rickettsia rickettsii was detected in 3 nymphs and 3 male adult ticks and Coxiella burnetii was detected in 4 nymphs (Supplementary Table S2). In addition, Anaplasma bovis, which infects ruminants, was found in one nymph (Supplementary Table S2). Ehrlichia spp., Francisella spp., and Borrelia spp. were not detected in this study.\nH. longicornis is the most common tick species in the grass in Korea. According to previous studies, out of 7,973 ticks collected from farms in Korea, 7,758 (97.3%) were identified as H. longicornis [25,26]. H. longicornis is also known as a transmitter of several pathogens such as Rickettsia spp., Anaplasmataceae, Borrelia spp., Babesia spp., Francisella spp., Bratonella spp., Coxiella spp., and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus [27].\nIn this study, we investigated the differences in the microbiomes of H. longicornis nymphs, female adults, and male adults. The Shannon index was significantly higher for nymphs than the adult ticks (Fig. 1C). This suggests that nymphs harbor a more diverse bacterial community compared to adult ticks. In 6 species of ticks, including Haemaphysalis leporispalustris, microbiome richness and diversity were highest in the larval stage and eventually decreased in subsequent life stages; this result is in concordance with our findings [28]. Life-stage related differences in the microbiome of H. longicornis indicate that the tick loses most of the bacteria present in the early developmental stages and then reestablishes the bacterial community after molting [29,30].\nCoxiella spp. is known as an endosymbiont essential for the survival and reproduction of hard ticks [26,31]. Coxiella-like bacteria are a large group of yet-to-be-isolated and characterized bacteria phylogenetically close to the<|endoftext|>"

At the time, Korean maps were showing Usando as Ulleungdo\u2019s neighboring island of Jukdo, which is 2.2 kilometers off Ulleungdo\u2019s east shore, so that means that this map did not reflect the Korean preception of Ulleungdo at the time. In other words, the Japanese had an outdated map of Ulleungdo in 1874.\nThe following is text that was written at the bottom of the map and explained certain aspects of it.\nOne aspect the text explained was the island of Ulleungdo (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6). Here is a cutout of the section describing Ulleungdo.\nUlleungdo (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6), also known as Isotakeshima (\u5f13\u5d69\u5cf6 \u2013 \u30a4\u30bd\u30c0\u30b1\u5cf6), is part of Gangwon Province. It is located in the sea 1,000 ri from Samcheok (\u4e09\u965f). It has a circumference of 940 to 950 ri.\nUlleungdo (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6), also known as Isotakeshima (\u5f13\u5d69\u5cf6 \u2013 \u30a4\u30bd\u30c0\u30b1\u5cf6), is part of Gangwon Province. It is located in the sea 1,000 ri from Samcheok (\u4e09\u965f), and has a circumference of approximately 140 to 150 ri.\nThe above translation makes much more sense since the circumference of Ulleungdo was approximately 140 to 150 ri. At any rate, the above map is evidence that, in 1874, Japan knew that Usando was a neighboring island of Ulleungdo, but still did not know the exact location.\nAt any rate, the above map is evidence that, in 1874, Japan knew that Usando was a neighboring island of Ulleungdo, but still did not know the exact location.\nUTSURYO-TO Island(\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6), otherwise known as ISOMOYA-TO Island(\u5f13\u5d69\u5cf6), is an island attached to KOGENDO(\u6c5f\u539f\u9053). It is located 1000 ri(\u5343\u91cc) away across the sea from SANSYO(\u4e09\u6e09) and its perimeter is 945 ri(945\u91cc).\nI am not sure if \u201cISOMOYA-TO\u201d is correct because the third character of Kana letters written between lines is blurred.\nCaptitalized words show that they are read in Japanese.\nI think \u4e5d\u767e\u56db\u4e94\u5341\u91cc should be 940~950 ri, not 945 ri.\nThanks Madboots, Ponta, & Pacifist.\nI am curious about the name \u5f13\u5d69\u5cf6, which also appears on this 1806 Japanese map of Korea. Is it possible that \u5f13\u5d69\u5cf6 could have been another way to write Usando (\u4e8e\u5c71\u5cf6), which literally means \u201chigh mountain island\u201d?\nHe wrote \u201c\u5f13\u5d69 \u30a4\u30bd\u30c0\u30b1\u201don a mountain in Ullungdo.\nYes, I used to assume that the \u201cTakeshima\u201d in Isotakeshima was referring to \u201cBamboo Island,\u201d but the Chinese character, \u5d69, suggest that it was referring to the \u201ctall mountain\u201d (\u5d69 = tall mountain) on Ulleungdo. That is why I am wondering if the name \u201cIsotakeshima\u201d might have evolved from \u201cUsando\u201d (\u4e8e\u5c71\u5cf6), which also means \u201cTall Mountain Island\u201d?\ngroup in America, whose aim is empowerment of Japanese Americans.\nJPCL is the first Japanese group in America that publicly supports such a resolution.\nand on the Japanese government to correct its historic texts.\nresolution early next month.\nReally? What is JPCL?\nI can\u2019t believe this. Can someone confirm about this news?\nGerry again what you have is a Japanese copy of a Korean map. It\u2019s a huge error of yours to automatically assume the territorial perceptions of \u201cthe Japanese\u201d on maps made by other countries.\nJapanese cartographers copied maps from all countries. At this time in the 19th Century Japanese mappers were citing maps from all around the world. So to take one map from historical archives and say \u201cthe Japanese thought\u2026\u201d is not a very logical approach to history.\nThe Japanese mappers had confused perception of this region as whole. However for the most part their belief was that two islands existed in the East Sea. The Japanese were placing Dokdo (Matsushima) and Ulleungdo (Takeshima) all over the East Sea during this time. The position of the islands was usually wrong and the form was almost never correct.\nWhat happened to the Japanese in 1840 gives us insight as to how foreign maps affected Japanese maps. The first Europeans mapped Ulleungdo too far West and named it Argonaut later it was mapped correctly and named Dagelet. This created two \u201cUlleungdo\u2019s\u201d in the East Sea, the Westerly island was non-existent (Argonaut) and the Eastern (Dagelet) was correctly located.\nSee this European map.\nFrom there Japanese mapmakers copied the European maps and blindly drew \u201ctwo islands\u201d Ulleungdo and Dokdo more Westerly. Note the position and shape of this Japanese map is exactly the same as the European map above.\nWhen Seibold assigned the name Takeshima to the non-existent \u201cArgonaut\u201d and Matsushima to Dagelet the Japanese began to perceive Ulleungdo and Dokdo much farther West.\nIt is possible that \u5f13\u5d69 means a mound like an arch.\nmadboots Good job!!\nI don\u2019t know about the organization, but there are Japanese who support the resolution.\nI think it would be wired if people of the democratic country unanimously agree on political issue, though there are such countries in East Asia.\nThis could also be said of Korean maps. When the Japanese viewed Korean maps of the East Sea, they again saw two islands in the East Sea. At a glance they could see that the scale of these maps was off. Ulleungdo was much to close to the Korean mainland for these maps to be of accurate scale, so they too considered Usando to be Matsushima. The Japanese government had very little information of the islands directly next to Ulleungdo, only until 1880 did the Japanese government accurately record the existence of Ulleungdo\u2019s \u201cneighbour islands.\nThus during the investigation into Takeshima around 1878 the Japanese compared Korean maps and documents and some made the natural conclusion that Usando was Matsushima (Dokdo) This makes sense when you compare the Korean maps to Japanese maps.\nNot only that when Anyongbok protested Japanese fishing on Ulleungdo he clearly stated \u201cJasando (Usando) was Matsushima (Dokdo)\u201d This incident would leave an indelible impression on the territorial perceptions of both Koreans and Japanese for centuries thereafter.\nOn page 5 of the Anyongbok report found in the archives of the Murakawa family of Shimane Prefecture it was stated \u201cJasando is Matsushima\u201d It was said to be in the middle of the North Sea and part of Kangwan Province.\nTo the Japanese this would have only meant one island-Dokdo. This is because in 1667 the Japanese document Onshu-shicho-goki also recorded and two islands in the North Sea called Takeshima and Matushima.\nThe Japanese viewed many maps and documents to arrive at a general consensus about the East Sea, the most basic principle they relied on was two islands existed in the east sea and they followed this rule often with blind conviction.\nToadface, you have yet to show me even one Korean or Japanese map that shows \u201cUsando\u201d as Liancourt Rocks. I, on the other hand, have shown you several Korean and Japanese maps that show \u201cUsando\u201d as a neighboring island of Ulleungdo.\n\u5d69(Kasa) means height and size of piled thing, or Volume, capacity, and weight.\nGenerally, it doesn\u2019t use it to describe a huge thing.\nWhen the big mountain and the ranging of it are described, \u5cb3 or \u5dbd is handled.\nThough I do not percice an English nuance easily,bulkness(ly) or thik(ly) or luxuriant(ly) may have same nuance.\n\u5f13(yumi) means bow.\nSo, The outline of the island may be seen like thick, tall a little, arc of the bended bow from a distance.\nThis is only a my imagination.\nMaybe the Korean concept of \u5d69 is different from the Japanese?\nNot only that when Anyongbok protested Japanese fishing on Ulleungdo he clearly stated \u201cJasando (Usando) was Matsushima (Dokdo)\u201d.\nThe word in the second parentheses is only your imagination and not right.\nNot only that when Anyongbok protested Japanese fishing on Ulleungdo he clearly stated \u201c<|endoftext|>"

Shipping from china to Korea Air freight from china to Korea Sea freight from china to Korea Ocean freight from china to Korea Door to door service from china to Korea Ddp service from china to Korea In this essay first you will be familiar with the country of Vietnam and the trade between China and this country. then you will get to know about the shipping modes from China to Vietnam and at last door to door transfer. Vietnam Vietnam is a country in Southeast Asia and with the population of 96.2 that has 58 provinces. The capital of this country is Hanoi. Vietnam\u2019s climate is different in each region. Temperature is higher in the plains than in the mountains. It is a communist country. Vietnam mainly has foreign relationship with various Chinese dynasties and had established diplomatic relations with 178 countries in 2010. The economy of this country has been based on agriculture and has increased exports and embarked on a policy of economic development by devaluing its exchange rate. In 2010, Vietnam was the eighth-largest petroleum producer in Asia and the US bought the highest amount of its exports through goods from China were the most popular Vietnamese import. Based on a forecast by Goldman Sachs, by 2025 the economy of this country will become the world\u2019s largest. Also, Vietnam manages 20 main civil airports that include three international gateways; Noi Bai in Hanoi, Da Nang International Airport in \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng and Tan Son Nhat in Ho Chi Minh City. SHIPPING FROM CHINA TO VIETNAM Recently, the trade between China and Vietnam has increased and has had good results. China and Vietnam share a 1,281 km border. Vietnam is fifth-largest export market for China. In addition, shipping your freight via sea or air from China to Vietnam can be is beneficial. Both countries have long coastlines with several international ports, and many international airports. How to Ship Ocean Freight From China to Vietnam Sea freight is a good choice when a supplier is located near a Chinese port since your cargo will be transported by a carrier in a shipping container. It depends on the volume of your goods to choose a full container (FCL) or a shared one (LCL). We can supply both. Now, let\u2019s describe both options. Less than Container Load (LCL) From China to Vietnam If you intend to ship small quantities, LCL is the good enough because it is affordable. Don\u2019t forget that your freight will be combined with the cargo of other shippers. This is effective for your business but it takes longer time since the container should be consolidated before export and de-consolidated upon import. Full Container Load (FCL) From China to Vietnam If time is important for you, then FCL can be better. FCL is a full container booked for your exclusive use at a flat rate. In this case, your products will be transported in a sealed container from origin to destination. It is faster and cheaper than LCL. Air Freight From China to Vietnam If you have to send your goods to Vietnam as quickly as possible, air shipping is the best choice. Since it is quicker and more flexible than the ocean freight. But keep in mind that this method is more expensive so you can choose it just for your small consignments that have high-value or very delicate. How Long Does it Take to Ship Cargo From China to Vietnam? Maybe you want to know how long your cargo will be at sea or in the air when traveling from China to Vietnam. The transit time and the price are important for taking decision about the method of transportation. As you know, air freight is the fastest and takes four to eight days that this time vary in sea transit depending on the distance to the ports. It may take 7 to 31 days. Door-to-door shipping from China to Vietnam Door-to-door method A door to door service is an all-inclusive package that you can ship your products without stress since all the items of packing, storage, loading/unloading, customs clearance, international freight, trucking\u2026 will be guaranteed from departure to arrival. How door-to-door services are helpful? In Door to Door air cargo service we contact your supplier and pickup shipment from seller. Also, we prepare all documents for export from china, book space, load to airplane and do customs clearance service. Finally, we deliver to customer address. DDPCH is a company that provides the best international logistics service. In order to meet your shipping requirements, we have a system that is economical, affordable, and reliable and also not limited to import and shipping from China to Vietnam. It also includes documentation, packaging, loading<|endoftext|>"

With this, the annual NEP in the unburned and burned forest areas was calculated as 1.25 and 0.02 t C ha -1 yr -1 respectively. These results suggest that both unburned and burned P. densiflora forests reflect the function of forest ecosystem as sinks of atmospheric CO 2 in 2012. However, the burned forest areas might have acted as a source until the recent few years.\nCarbon budgets in the unburned (a) and burned forest areas (b) in 2012 (t C ha-1, 1 t = 103 kg). NEP, net ecosystem production; NPP, net primary production; HR, heterotrophic respiration; SR, soil respiration; RR, root respiration.\nIn the unburned and the burned study sites, the annual total standing biomass of vegetation except for the herb layer during the survey period of six years from 2007 to 2012 is shown in Table 5. Annual mean growth rates were documented as 8.83 t ha -1 yr -1 in the unburned site and 4.08 t ha -1 yr -1 in the burned site ( Fig. 4 ). The estimated annual total standing biomass in the burned site prior to the forest fire by applying the annual mean growth rate in the unburned site was about 232.3 t ha -1 yr -1. It was assumed to need about 38 years until the burned study site become to the standing biomass in the P. densiflora forest prior to the fire, through the natural recovery period of 12 years after the forest fire. Therefore, since the eastern coast forest fire of South Korea in 2000, the damaged P. densiflora forest areas are required at least 50 years to become the optimum conditions of the forest ecosystem prior to the fire. In the present of 2012, the burned P. densiflora forest areas have recovered by about 24%.\nThis study was conducted in the unburned P. densiflora forest, and the burned P. densiflora forest in which the area damaged by the eastern coast forest fire in 2000, which has gone through the natural restoration process and the recovery period for 12 years around Samcheok-si, Gangwon-do, South Korea. The annual net carbon storage of vegetation (i.e., NPP) in 2012 was 5.75 t C ha -1 in the unburned forest and 2.14 t C ha -1 in the burned forest. During the entire experiment period, the monthly mean soil respiration rate was 2.74 \u00b1 0.49 \u03bcmol CO 2 m -2 s -1 in the unburned site and 1.37 \u00b1 0.26 \u03bcmol CO 2 m -2 s -1 in the burned site. The soil respiration rate in both sites had a strong correlation with the soil temperature. The temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (i.e., Q10 value) was higher in the unburned site than those in the burned site. The estimated annual total soil respiration and heterotrophic respiration (HR) were 8.66 and 4.50 t C ha -1 yr -1 in the unburned site and 4.08 and 2.12 t C ha -1 yr -1 in the burned site, respectively. The estimated annual NEP in the unburned and burned forests was found to be 1.25 and 0.02 t C ha -1 yr -1, respectively. Our results indicate that the differences of carbon cycle and budget between the unburned and burned sites are considerably attributed to the losses of living plant biomass in the above and belowground of P. densiflora forest due to the huge damage caused by the forest fire, and insufficient nutrients and low organic materials in the forest soil of burned site. Although both unburned and burned forests play as sinks of atmospheric CO 2, the burned forest areas might have acted as a source until the recent few years. It was found that the damaged P. densiflora forest area is required at least 50 years to become the natural conditions of the forest ecosystem prior to the forest fire. It seems that the burned P. densiflora forest areas have recovered by about 24% in the present of 2012. However, in fact, it is difficult to reveal the impacts of forest fire in related to the carbon cycle and budget of P. densiflora forest ecosystem, only with the results obtained by field measurements during this short-term research period. Therefore, further detailed and long-term studies are necessary to establish an accurate evaluation of the carbon balance and dynamics in the burned P. densiflora forest until the damaged forest ecosystem completely becomes a natural recovery into the initial state prior to the forest fire.\nThis work was funded by the Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program (Grant No. KMIPA 2015-6040).

The extent of heritable variation in growth parameters is estimated from parent-offspring correlations and from repeatabilities of successive measurements on the same palms. The FFB price of RM370 per ton is the minimum price to reach the break-even point, with the assumption of other factors remains unchanged.. Background and Purpose: Due to the fact that poplar rotation is one of the shortest in forestry, and as production of poplar wood requires rational and well-planned management, the potentials of sites and species must be maximally utilised. Replanting provides an opportunity for the estate to make improvement on the present system such as accessibility for mechanization and re-alignment of road, drain intensity, planting density, and it also can solve the harvesting problem, low yield and prevailing prices of palm product.

Only recently, though, have we begun to understand how these changes are regulated on a global scale. Some of the most exciting scientific discoveries of recent decades have shown us how physical, geological, chemical, biological, and human processes all interact with each other to control this never-ending process of global change.\nGlobal Change Research is an attempt to increase our understanding of those processes and interactions that regulate the total Earth system, and of their cumulative effects on the future of our planet. The study of Global Change is particularly important, as it is now clear that human social and economic activities around the world are having an impact that can be measured at the level of the entire Earth and its atmosphere, oceans, and land surface. Human activities are probably the most rapidly changing component among the major regulators of the Earth system, and may, in the future, play a dominant role in the regulation of global climate, global biogeochemistry, and the diversity and stability of global ecosystems (http://www.lternet.edu/global_change) (Lee et al. 2006).\nOur planet and global environment are witnessing the most profound changes in the brief history of the human species. Human activity is the major agent of those changes--depletion of stratospheric ozone, the threat of global warming, deforestation, acid precipitation, the extinction of species, and others that have not become apparent (Defries and Malone 1989).\nHumans manage much of the Earth system, and their role in this regard is certain to increase in the future. However, this management of the whole Earth is not always acknowledged, much less clearly understood. It is incumbent on humans to understand how their actions have global effects, and to use that understanding to manage their impacts on the global as well as the local levels. For this reason, Global Change Research is a high national and international scientific priority (http://www.lternet.edu/global_change).\nThe term \u201cLong Term Ecological Research (LTER)\u201d was used for the first time as NSF of USA begins to supply research fund by the name. LTER is a method of ecological research which is progressed long time in a given ecosystem as a research system being required necessarily in the ecological study, in which spatial scale for research object is big and thereby long period is required for understanding the reality. This research system began long period to get agreement globally as the importance and research efficiency of LTER are embossed from 1990\u2019s (Ministry of Environment of Korea 2004b) and similar research programs of various countries around the world were joined into ILTER in 1993 (Ministry of Environment of Korea 2004a).\nLTER sites are windows to global change. As observatories, LTER sites serve to document long-term changes in plants, animals, microbes, and soils in relation to long-term climate and short-term weather changes. As locations for long-term experiments, LTER sites illuminate interactions among the physical, chemical, and biological components of ecosystems through controlled manipulations. As representatives of global biodiversity, LTER sites allow for comparisons of the relative sensitivity of populations, communities, and ecosystems to environmental changes. Finally, synthesis and modeling of results from LTER sites provides predictions of feedbacks, both positive and negative, on global change. Research at LTER sites spans a broad range from relatively less-managed landscapes such as arctic tundra, to intensively managed cities and farmlands.\nThe Korean National Long-Term Ecological Research (KNLTER) designated Mts. Jeombong, Worak, and Jiri as the representative research sites for the northern, central and southern areas of South Korea, respectively. In addition, Mt. Nam, the Yeocheon industrial complex, Wanju, Jeju Island, and Samcheok were designated as sites for researches on terrestrial ecosystem of urban, industrial, agricultural, island and burned areas, respectively. The Han River, Nakdong River, Upo swamp, Daecheong Dam, Saemangum tidal flat, Hampyung Bay, and Goraebul sand dunes were designated as research sites for the monitoring of the aquatic ecosystems.\nForest environments are currently faced with severe environmental stress and disturbances. Excessive development of forests from population increases, climate change due to increases in warming gases, environmental pollution, and resultant severe changes are predicted. In order to cope with this real aspect and the changes that may occur in the future, the dynamics of forest communities need to be analyzed. The accumulation of basic data through the LTER could be helpful for understanding of the structure and function of the global ecosystem, and may also contribute profoundly maintenance and management of the ecosystem.\nMt. Nam is located in the center of Seoul, as a LTER site of urban area. The area, where Mt. Nam is located, has experienced very rapid changes in landscape structure due to urbanization and industrialization accelerated since the 1960s. Changes in the landscape structure of Seoul were attributable to increases of urbanized area. Forest and agricultural fields such as paddy and upper fields have decreased as the result of these changes. Excessive land use by humans has resulted not only in quantitative reductions but also qualitative degradation of greenery space, which absorbs and filters environmental stresses such as air pollution, acid rain, and the urban heat island effect. Causal factors of forest decline in Seoul are difficult to clarify through temporary and partial research as forest decline is result from the interaction of various factors. In this regard, Mt. Nam is a crucial site for long-term ecological research on the urban landscape (Cho et al. 2009a, 2009b).\nMt. Jeombong is located on Girin-myeon, Inje-gun, Gangwon-do, in central-eastern Korea, and is the representative forest area in Korea. Deciduous broad-leaved forest is well developed and diverse plant communities appear, and thus the area is of high academic value (Lee et al. 2000).\n[Fig. 1.] Physiognomic vegetation maps of Mts.

It appears that you can see even the lighthouse on Dokdo, which is 92 kilometers southeast of Ulleungdo. Supposedly, even two mountain ridges near Samcheok City in Gangwon Province were also captured by the camera on the same day. The mountain ridges are between 130 and 150 kilometers away from Ulleungdo. Link to the Korean article.\nThe two islands of Usan and Mu-leung are due east of the present \u201chyeon\u201d (Uljin), and the distance between them is close enough that they are visible on a clear, windy day. In the time of Silla, they were called Unsan-guk or Ulleungdo.\nFinally, I would just like to remind people that Koreans back during the Joseon Dynasty did not have a Nikon camera with a zoom lens or a sign pointing in the direction of Dokdo. They also probably did not have the time and patience to sit on top of a mountain on Ulleungdo waiting to get a view of a ghost island that may appear only once in a blue moon.\nemprator, do you know from what elevation one is able to see Mount Clemente from San Diego?\nBad moon rising. We don\u2019t really need to determine whether or not Dokdo is visible from Ulleungdo when even Japanese records like the link I posted state it is true.\nFor what it is worth here are the sketches of Dokdo done by the Russian Navy in 1854. They are from different angles and distances. The top left image is Dokdo as seen from a distance of 6.5kms the bottom left is from 9.3kms and the top right is Dokdo Island as viewed from 26kms away. They were done from the naked eye and from sea level.\nCorrection the date of the map was 1857.\nIt took 40 days to this photograph with 500mm lens, according to the article on \u6bce\u65e5\u65b0\u805e at December 10, 1999.\nSure, the best way to verify Dokdo\u2019s visibility is to actually go to Ulleungdo. But Gerry-Bevers is wondering whether Dokdo is large enough to be seen from 92km away.\nThe link I got the quote from does not indicate the elvation from which San Clemente is visible. But if you\u2019re trying to relate that to Dokdo, I would think that elevation is important mostly because of line-of-sight.\nThat calculator seems to assume no refraction. This page on Distance to Horizon suggests that refraction extends the distance to apparent horizon, which would mean that the height required to see the whole of Dokdo is probably less than 700m.\nI\u2019m only trying to address the question of visibility. I don\u2019t see why so many people assume this photo is fake. If the capability of the camera is in question, someone familiar with the camera should calculate how many pixels Dokdo would take up in the picture if zoomed in all the way with the camera.\nIf your goal is to show Dokdo belongs to Korea or Japan, it\u2019s probably better to debate whether visibility is relevant to that issue.\n> Dokdo is/was not an inherent part of Japan since ancient times.\nTakeshima/Dokdo (Matsushima) was a part of Japan since early 17th century. Ulleungdo was also thought to be Japanese territory in the 17th century, as you can see in the Onsyu-Shicho-Gouki (1667) which clearly said that Ulleungdo was Japanese boundary. After Ulleungdo was returned to Korea in 1696, Takeshima/Dokdo remained in the Japanese territory.\n> I have about another dozen Shimane Prefecture maps that show the same.\nAs I\u2019ve written many times, a map without something doesn\u2019t mean anything although if a map with something clearly depicted, it will be a evidence to show that they knew it.\nJapan has accurate maps of Takeshima/Dokdo but Korea has none.\n> Pacifist are trying to claim that a military acquisition is a legitimate criteria for incorporating land!!\ntoadface, I didn\u2019t say it is legitimate to take one island brutally by force. Korea did it brutally and still keeps occupying it. You must remember that some Japanese fishermen were killed because of Korean violence, but in 1905 no Koreans were killed because there were no Koreans, they even didn\u2019t know about the island.\nJapan didn\u2019t take it brutally in 1905 because it was no man\u2019s land \u2013 at least Korea didn\u2019t know about the island until 1905. So Korea doesn\u2019t have a right to claim.\nIf you want to refute, why don\u2019t you bring the evidence to show that Korea knew it, used it or owned it before 1905?\nBut you haven\u2019t succeeded in it yet.\nIsn\u2019t it an essential thing if one country claim another country\u2019s land?\nFrom what I have read, if this picture was taken with a 500mm lens, then that means the image looks ten times bigger than it would look with the naked eye. Imagine an image one tenth the size of the one in the picture. It would be just a spot on the horizon. Not only that, it would be a spot that appears only when conditions are just right. If it took the photographer forty days waiting on a mountaintop to see that spot, even though he already knew which direction to point his camera, then how likely would it have been for Koreans trying to survive on Ulleungdo hundreds of years ago to have spotted that spot not knowing in which direction to look?\nIn 1882, Lee Gyu-won confirmed that Koreans did not know where \u201cDokdo\u201d was. He also went to the top of Ulleungdo\u2019s tallest mountain to look for islands on the horizon, but reported that he did not see \u201ceven a lump of dirt.\u201d Lee also confirmed that the Koreans living on Ulleungdo at the time also did not know where \u201cUsando\u201d (Dokdo) was. They had heard Usando was a neighboring island of Ulleungdo, but did not know its location.\nUsando was just another name for Jukdo, Ulleungdo\u2019s largest neighboring island, 2.2 kilometers off its northeast shore.\nThank you for the confirmation that Lee asked about Usan.

        "passage": " and assessing uncertainties.\nThe GLUE technique is known as a systematic parameter calibration method that can remedy the drawback that the user's subjectivity could be inherent when selecting parameters through trial-and-error. The basic premise is that GLUE is performed on the basis of equifinality, which can derive the same level of prediction performance at the various input conditions caused by nonlinear interaction and uncertainties when modeling is conducted to reproduce a specific phenomenon (Beven, 2006). Afterward, a combination of numerous parameters created by Monte Carlo sampling is numerically simulated, thereby selecting the optimal combination of the parameters based on the likelihood calculated by quantifying the accuracy of the simulated results and removing various uncertainties. Simmons et al. (2017) applied the GLUE technique to Lido Di Classe in Italy as a study sea, in which the calibration of XBeach had already been conducted using a trial-and-error method by Harley et al. (2016), to select the optimal combination of parameters and compared their result with that of Harley et al. (2016). Thus, they discovered that GLUE required more numerical simulation cases and took more time to calculate than the trial-and-error method did, but the prediction performance was successfully improved by objectively considering a wide range of parameters. They also suggested the changing sensitivity of XBeach parameters according to the nearshore morphological change (overwash or collision regime) via the storm effect defined by Sallenger (2000) using the GLUE technique. Simmons et al. (2019) selected three nearby beaches, including Narrabeen beach in Sydney, Australia, as a study area and quantified and calibrated the one-dimensional (1D) simulation results through GLUE. In doing so, they successfully simulated beach erosion after a storm in Narrabeen, and XBeach showed a significant improvement in prediction performance when calibrating parameters using one or more storm event datasets, suggesting the importance of calibration for numerical simulation. They also generalized the optimal parameters of the three beaches through GLUE and proposed different parameter values for each beach, reported as an effect of beach characteristics.\nAs described above, previous studies demonstrated successful one-dimensional (1D) numerical simulation results when applying GLUE to XBeach. However, for regions where morphological changes in the alongshore direction are prominent, such as the eastern coast of Korea, where a crescentic sand bar was developed, it is essential to have a numerical simulation incorporating two-dimensional (2D) coastal processes, such as cross-shore sediment transport along with alongshore sediment transport and sediment transport by a nearshore current. Thus, this study verified the applicability of GLUE to 2D XBeach simulation results, not studied much until now, proposed an optimal range of parameters, and analyzed uncertainties.\n\nIntroduction of the XBeach Model and GLUE\nXBeach has been widely used to simulate hydraulic characteristics and the morphodynamic response of nearshore areas, such as dunes and sandy beaches, during storms in various coastal engineering fields.\nXBeach is a 2D numerical model that calculates wave propagation and morphological changes by combining fluid dynamics and morphodynamic processes on the basis of physical phenomena under short-term storm wave conditions. Particularly, it has the advantage of simulating infragravity waves using a nonlinear shallow water equation under the surf-beat mode. However, nonlinear processes are characterized by inherent numerous free parameters because of inadequate understanding of breaking waves, sediment transport, etc., which are represented through parameterization in XBeach (Bolle et al., 2010;McCall et al., 2010;Roelvink et al., 2009). It also has a limitation in that the default parameter setting in the model excessively Generally, XBeach is calibrated through a passive trial-and-error method considering only partial parameters based on the researcher's experience and prior studies. However, this study employed GLUE as a new parameter calibration technique. GLUE is a departure from a passive calibration method that considers only a single parameter one at a time, as is done in a trial-and-error method, but instead selects a range of parameters when conducting a calibration to produce many combinations through Monte Carlo sampling. Thereby, it takes recourse to an active calibration method to conduct numerical simulations and quantification systematically and sequentially. As GLUE conducts numerical simulations of many combinations, it relatively takes a great deal of simulation time, but it has the advantage of increasing the reliability of the final proposed parameters and quantitatively analyzing uncertainties inherent to numerical models.\n\nSeas, the Subject of Research\nThe subject area of this study is Maengbang beach, located in Samcheok, Gangwon-do, which is approximately a 4-km-long stretch, from the southwestern to northeastern direction. It is a quasi-linear beach, where Osipcheon River is located in the north and Maeupcheon River in the south near Samcheok Port, which is downstream of Osipcheon River, and Deokbongsan Mountain, which is downstream of Maeupcheon River. The foreshore slope of Maengbang beach is a range of 8\u00b0-15\u00b0, but the average slope on the sea floor is 1.4\u00b0-2\u00b0, which is relatively stable. The average beach width in the longitudinal direction of the beach is 52.48 m, and the minimum and maximum beach widths are 34.9 m and 135.5 m, respectively, with a difference of approximately 100 m. Because of this, arc-shaped beach cusps of various sizes are found onshore. A crescentic sandbar is also continuously maintained, a typical feature of the eastern coast of South Korea in the water. Jin et al. (2020) reported a correlation between the alongshore variability of beach width and the location of the crescentic sandbar. The mean tide range is approximately 0.2 m, indicating a low tide environment. Thus, the effect of the tide is relatively minimal, but waves are dominant, with high risk due to high waves. In addition, the erosion grade evaluation conducted on the current status of coastal erosion by the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries revealed that all sections in Maengbang beach were C (concerned erosion) or D (serious erosion) from 2016 to 2019. This was adjudged considering the increasing trend of high waves caused by climate change, the reduction in the buffer zone, and the increase in reflected waves because of the shore protection built at the rear. Fig. 1 schematizes the geographical location of Maengbang beach and the grid area used in XBeach modeling.\n\nWave Observation Data\nWave observation was conducted employing acoustic waves and a current profiler (AWAC, Nortek) installed in the open sea around Maengbang beach to acquire a water level change every 60 min with an interval of 1 s. The AWAC was installed at a depth of approximately 30 m in the observation location (W1, latitude: 37\u00b024' 11.22'' N, longitude: 129\u00b013' 34.56'' E), and observations have been conducted constantly since February 2017. Fig. 2 schematizes the time-series wave data (significant wave height, peak wave period, and peak wave direction) in Maengbang beach in 2019 when storm scenarios occurred as well as a wave rose diagram (significant wave height and mean wave direction). The wave data for some sections around January were missing. Other than that, complete data were obtained. As shown in Fig. 2, incident waves, the significant wave height of which was less than 1.0 m, found in Maengbang beach in 2019 accounted for approximately 71% of all waves, but high waves above 2.0 m explained only 5.4%. Approximately 82% of the peak wave period was less than 8 s, and approximately 70.5% of the peak wave directions were less than 77.5\u00b0. Most average wave directions of incident waves were found in the NE section, nearly perpendicular to the shoreline of Maengbang Beach. This was due to the effect of wind direction being similar to wave direction and the effect of wind drift distance according to the geographical feature of the eastern coast of Korea, stretching northeast (Cho and Kim, 2019).\nFurthermore, the features of wave direction were distinctive according to the season. Therefore, overall, the average wave direction was 45\u00b0-90\u00b0 in summer and 0\u00b0-45\u00b0 in winter, which showed a fluctuation. High waves, the significant wave height of which was more than 3 m, were concentrated from September to December Typhoon Lingling, the first typhoon in that period, affected the beach indirectly as it was going north to the West Sea; its significant wave  directly through Maengbang beach. The significant wave height at the peak was 3.8 m, the peak wave period was 10.7 s, which was the highest value, and the peak wave direction was 42\u00b0, nearly perpendicular to the shoreline. The significant wave height during Typhoon Hagibis was 4.2 m, the second largest, the peak wave period was 10.5 s, and the peak wave direction was 53.4\u00b0. Table 1 summarizes the wave observation data at the time of the most significant wave height during the four typhoons. Fig. 3 shows the wave data schematized from August 29 to October 30 in 2019, the storm strike period, used as input data in XBeach in this study.    (Table 2). Additionally, a non-erodible layer option was applied to Deokbongsan or coastal roads, with the sediment thickness mentioned in a previous study that had a significant impact on simulation results (Do and Yoo, 2020).\n\nConfiguration of the Numerical Model and Selection of Calibration Parameters\nTo simulate offshore fluid dynamic and morphodynamic processes during a storm, the currently widely used and proven surf-beat mode was used among many modes in XBeach that showed a difference in the hydraulic analysis of wave<|endoftext|>"

According to Dr. Sohn, President Kim devoted his entire life to the liberation of Korea, starting with fighting against the Japanese stationed in North Korea and China. He became the first premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea when it was established in, and led his nation in the Korean War from to /5(1). Members of the brigades receive special training for various unconventional warfare missions. These seven units are part of ROK Special Forces, founded in and fall under the jurisdiction of the Republic of Korea Army Special Warfare Command, which was created in The United Nations Command (UNC) is the unified command structure for the multinational military forces, established in, supporting South Korea (the Republic of Korea or ROK) during and after the Korean War..

You get to brag about stepping into North Korea AND gain much more knowledge about the unique humanitarian crisis that Koreans face! This indicates a new and more complex global security environment with increasing risks of terrorists trying to acquire and deploy a CBRN (Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear) attack. This book addresses the critical importance of understanding innovation and decision-making between terrorist groups and unconventional weapons, and the. These specialists can set up the most realistic operations security training scenarios possible. I have noticed too many times that training scenarios conducted by personnel within the unit, though well planned, tend to be redundant. In my opinion, the Army should implement more unconventional warfare training in units across the formation.

To Korea, Washington\u2019s move to reduce the USFK and Agnew\u2019s visit were serious.\nThe Blue House\u2019s then-Chief of Staff Kim Chung-yum recalls that President Park Chung Hee had postponed all other schedules for two weeks before meeting with Agnew to focus on the issue. In the two meetings with the American vice president, President Park demanded that they discuss the USFK downsizing and Korea\u2019s security simultaneously, the modernization of ROK military equipment and long-term military assistance, and that no more than 20,000 troops leave the country. Vice President Agnew said that the 7th Division may leave, but the 2nd Division would stay, and the reduction would be within 20,000 troops so it would not affect Korea\u2019s national security. President Park felt assured.\nMany things have changed between then and the visit to Seoul by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. In a meeting with President Park Geun-hye on Dec. 6, Biden said, \u201cIt\u2019s never been a good bet to bet against America,\u201d and \u201cAmerica will continue to place its bet on South Korea.\u201d No matter how we interpret it, the comments sound like a warning not to be stirred by China\u2019s emergence, to continue the close alliance with the United States and not to leave the cooperative union with the United States and Japan. Vice President Agnew was concerned of America getting \u201centrapped\u201d in Korean Peninsula issues and tried to abandon Korea, but Biden revealed Washington\u2019s intention to involve Korea in America\u2019s new Asia-Pacific strategy.\nPresident Park Geun-hye was wise to respond, \u201cKorea will continue to develop a strategic partnership with China to contribute to the peace and development of the region.\u201d If she had sided with Washington and bet \u201call-in\u201d in holding China in check, it would have had considerable repercussions. The Seoul-Beijing relations would have been aggravated, Beijing-Pyongyang relations would improve and the inter-Korean relationship would be rocked for sure. While the \u201cdouble-dipping\u201d strategy of relying on the United States for security and leaning on China for the economy works best for now, we can\u2019t be sure how long it will last.\nMoreover, even if economic interests are important, Korea can\u2019t bet on China completely. Lukewarm diplomacy could lead to abandonment by both America and China and ultimately isolation. Yet we cannot attempt to bypass the United States and China and stand alone. Aggressive, self-reliant defense through nuclear armament or the passive diplomacy of declaring permanent neutrality cannot resolve Korea\u2019s dilemma. It is truly a complicated situation.\nWhat should the Park Geun-hye administration choose in the end? Let\u2019s review what President Park Chung Hee did four decades ago. First, we need to clearly state our will for self-reliant national defense. Second, we should be wary of excessive dependency on the Korea-U.S. alliance and prepare diplomatic groundwork to escape from the traps of \u201cabandonment\u201d and \u201centrapment.\u201d That\u2019s why improving inter-Korean relations is inevitable despite the atrociousness of the North Korean regime. Third, Korea needs to take the initiative to create the mood for peace and cooperation so that China\u2019s relations with America and Japan can improve. To prepare the atmosphere, good relationships with neighbors and balanced foreign policy are required. Especially, we cannot refuse cooperation with Japan, which is in a similar situation.\nThe solution can be found from the Korean Peninsula trust process and the Northeast Asia Peace and Cooperation Plan. President Park already knows the answer. We need to carry it out through creative diplomacy and bold determination. We must not break the well-planned foreign policy strategy by getting tangled in unexpected variables and failing to read the overall drift of the Northeast Asian region.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "[May 21, 2021] Hanwha is actively combating climate change, taking steps towards achieving carbon neutrality. One of the key ways in which Hanwha does this is through its Solar Forest campaign\u2014an environmentally-friendly social responsibility campaign that was launched back in 2011.\nOn April 20th, Hanwha held an event to celebrate the completion of its 8th Hanwha Solar Forest, which forms part of the Samcheok Carbon Neutral Forest plantation in Gangwon Province Korea. The Samcheok Carbon Neutral Forest is one of several national forests being created through the \u2019Forest Strategy for Carbon Neutrality 2050\u2019 project. Under this project, the Korea Forest Service aims to plant 3 billion trees over the course of 30 years, and reduce carbon by 34 million tons.\nSince March, Hanwha has planted 15,000 black locust tree saplings (a species from which honeybees collect nectar from its flowers) that were grown in a solar-powered seedling nursery on approximately 5 hectares of land in Samcheok City, South Korea. Once mature, the forest will be able to absorb 162 tons of CO\u2082 and 0.33 tons of fine dust every year.\nBlack locust trees were specifically chosen to create the carbon-neutral forest to maximize carbon capture because at the age of 30 years, they absorb on average 14% more CO\u2082 than a species widely known to absorb vast amounts of greenhouse gases\u2014the oak tree.\nThe planting of the 15,000 trees was initiated through one of Hanwha\u2019s contactless campaign activities\u2014efforts that have continued despite the Covid-19 pandemic. The company has been promoting its exclusive campaign mobile application called Solar Forest\u2014launched last year in June\u2014to promote awareness and encourage participation in the latest Solar Forest project. The campaign successfully spread awareness and kept the public engaged, incentivizing them to plant trees virtually, with Hanwha promising to match every virtual tree with a real tree planted in the next Solar Forest. Campaign participants\u2014also known as Forest Heroes\u2014responded enthusiastically by virtually \u2019growing\u2019 15,000 trees and then donating them to the cause. In turn, Hanwha physically planted 15,000 trees in its 8th Solar Forest.\nHanwha Solar Forest is a campaign that began in 2011 in partnership with Tree Planet, a social venture company, to create eco-friendly forests locally and globally. Since the planting of Mongolia\u2019s Tujiin Nars Desertification Prevention Forest back in 2012, a total of seven forests have been cultivated in China and Korea. Combined, these forests cover an area the size of approximately 180 football fields with over half a million trees. Hanwha\u2019s efforts have directly prevented desertification, helped purify water and air, and have even limited soil leakages in these regions.\nWhat makes the Hanwha Solar Forest campaign even more special is the use of solar-powered seedling nurseries. Tree nurseries normally use electricity produced from fossil fuels to grow trees, which releases carbon into the air. However, since solar nurseries are powered by solar energy, these forests are also eco-friendlier. Beginning with the 2 nd solar forest, Hanwha Solar Forests were planted using saplings raised with solar power.\nThrough the Hanwha Solar Forest campaign, Hanwha is providing solutions to environmental problems such as desertification and fine dust. At the same time, the company is encouraging people to participate in activities that raise awareness and foster environmental consciousness.\nIn 2011, the Hanwha Solar Forest Campaign was recognized by the United Nations as a model example of reforestation at the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) as well as being the world\u2019s first example of utilizing solar energy to grow trees for reforestation to fight the effects of desertification. Then, at the 2018 United Nations High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development held at the UN Headquarters, Hanwha Solar Forest was recognized again as an example of how corporate partnerships can contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).<|endoftext|>"

The fire PRA modeling included calculation of fire severity factors (SFs) and fire non-suppression probabilities (PNS) for each safe shutdown (SSD) component considered in the fire PRA model. The SFs were developed by performing detailed fire modeling through a combination of CFAST fire zone model calculations and Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). Component damage times and automatic fire suppression system actuation times calculated in the CFAST LHS analyses were then input to a time-dependent model of fire non-suppression probability. The fire non-suppression probability model is based on the modeling approach outlined in NUREG/CR-6850 and is supplemented with plant specific data. This paper presents the methodology used in the DOE facility fire PRA for modeling fire-induced SSD component failures and includes discussions of modeling techniques for: Development of time-dependent fire heat release rate profiles (required as input to CFAST), Calculation of fire severity factors based on CFAST detailed fire modeling, and Calculation of fire non-suppression probabilities.\nFull Text Available Forest fires are a major natural disaster that destroys a forest area and a natural environment. In order to minimize the damage caused by the forest fire, it is necessary to know the location and the time of day and continuous monitoring is required until fire is fully put out. We have tried to improve the forest fire detection algorithm by using a method to reduce the variability of surrounding pixels. We focused that forest areas of East Asia, part of the Himawari-8 AHI coverage, are mostly located in mountainous areas. The proposed method was applied to the forest fire detection in Samcheok city, Korea on May 6 to 10, 2017.\nRust, A.; Saxe, S.; Hogue, T. S.; McCray, J. E.; Rhoades, C.\nRecurrent fires and environment shape the vegetation in Quercus suber L. woodlands and maquis.\nThe effects of fire recurrence on vegetation patterns in Quercus suber L. and Erica-Cistus communities in Mediterranean fire-prone ecosystems of south-eastern France were examined on stands belonging to 5 fire classes, corresponding to different numbers of fires (from 0 to 4) and time intervals between fires since 1959. A common pool of species was identified among the plots, which was typical of both open and closed maquis. Fire recurrence reduced the abundance of trees and herbs, whereas it increased the abundance of small shrubs. Richness differed significantly between the most contrasting classes of fire recurrence, with maximal values found in control plots and minimal values in plots that had burned recurrently and recently. Equitability indices did not vary significantly, in contrast to Shannon's diversity index which mostly correlated with richness. Forest ecosystems that have burnt once or twice in the last 50 years were resilient; that is to say they recovered a biomass and composition similar to that of the pre-fire state. However, after more than 3-4 fires, shrubland communities displayed lower species richness and diversity indices than unburned plots. The time since the last fire and the number of fires were the most explanatory fire variables, governing the structure of post-fire plant communities. However, environmental factors, such as slope or exposure, also made a significant contribution. Higher rates of fire recurrence can affect the persistence or expansion of shrublands in the future, as observed in other Mediterranean areas.

All rights reserved.\nThe forest area in the western United States that burns annually is increasing with warmer temperatures, more frequent droughts, and higher fuel densities. Studies that examine fire effects for regional carbon balances have tended to either focus on individual fires as examples or adopt generalizations without considering how forest type, fire severity, and regional climate influence carbon legacies. This study provides a more detailed characterization of fire effects and quantifies the full carbon impacts in relation to direct emissions, slow release of fire-killed biomass, and net carbon uptake from forest regrowth. We find important variations in fire-induced mortality and combustion across carbon pools (leaf, live wood, dead wood, litter, and duff) and across low- to high-severity classes. This corresponds to fire-induced direct emissions from 1984 to 2008 averaging 4 TgC/yr and biomass killed averaging 10.5 TgC/yr, with average burn area of 2723 sq km/yr across the western United States. These direct emission and biomass killed rates were 1.4 and 3.7 times higher, respectively, for high-severity fires than those for low-severity fires. The results show that forest regrowth varies greatly by forest type and with severity and that these factors impose a sustained carbon uptake legacy. The western U.S. fires between 1984 and 2008 imposed a net source of 12.3 TgC/yr in 2008, accounting for both direct fire emissions (9.5 TgC/yr) and heterotrophic decomposition of fire-killed biomass (6.1 TgC yr1) as well as contemporary regrowth sinks (3.3 TgC/yr). A sizeable trend exists toward increasing emissions as a larger area burns annually.\n\nFridlin, Ann; vanDiedenhoven, Bastiaan; Ackerman, Andrew S.; Avramov, Alexander; Mrowiec, Agnieszka; Morrison, Hugh; Zuidema, Paquita; Shupe, Matthew D.\nObservations of long-lived mixed-phase Arctic boundary layer clouds on 7 May 1998 during the First International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) Regional Experiment (FIRE)Arctic Cloud Experiment (ACE)Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) campaign provide a unique opportunity to test understanding of cloud ice formation. Under the microphysically simple conditions observed (apparently negligible ice aggregation, sublimation, and multiplication), the only expected source of new ice crystals is activation of heterogeneous ice nuclei (IN) and the only sink is sedimentation. Large-eddy simulations with size-resolved microphysics are initialized with IN number concentration N(sub IN) measured above cloud top, but details of IN activation behavior are unknown. If activated rapidly (in deposition, condensation, or immersion modes), as commonly assumed, IN are depleted from the well-mixed boundary layer within minutes. Quasi-equilibrium ice number concentration N(sub i) is then limited to a small fraction of overlying N(sub IN) that is determined by the cloud-top entrainment rate w(sub e) divided by the number-weighted ice fall speed at the surface v(sub f). Because w(sub c) 10 cm/s, N(sub i)/N(sub IN)<< 1. Such conditions may be common for this cloud type, which has implications for modeling IN diagnostically, interpreting measurements, and quantifying sensitivity to increasing N(sub IN) (when w(sub e)/v(sub f)< 1, entrainment rate limitations serve to buffer cloud system response). To reproduce observed ice crystal size distributions and cloud radar reflectivities with rapidly consumed IN in this case, the measured above-cloud N(sub IN) must be multiplied by approximately 30. However, results are sensitive to assumed ice crystal properties not constrained by measurements. In addition, simulations do not reproduce the pronounced mesoscale heterogeneity in radar reflectivity that is observed.\nIncreased heat resistance in mycelia from wood fungi prevalent in forests characterized by fire: a possible adaptation to forest fire.\nForest fires have been the major stand-replacing/modifying disturbance in boreal forests. To adapt to fire disturbance, different strategies have evolved. This study focuses on wood fungi, and a specific adaptation to forest fire: increased heat resistance in their mycelia. Fifteen species of wood fungi were selected and a priori sorted in two groups according to their prevalence in fire-affected environments. The fungi were cultivated on fresh wood and exposed to 100, 140, 180, 220\u00c2 \u00c2\u00b0C for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25\u00c2 min. under laboratory conditions. A clear difference was found among the two groups. Species prevalent in fire-affected habitats had a much higher survival rate over all combinations of time and temperature compared to species associated with other environments. Thus, the results indicate that fire adaptation in terms of increased heat resistance in mycelia occurs in some species of wood fungi. Such adaptation will influence the ecology and population dynamics of wood fungi, as well as having implications for best practices during restoration fires.

This is however not a simple feedforward flow of information: there is a significant feedback from cortical cells back to both relay cells and interneurons in the dLGN. Despite four decades of experimental and theoretical studies, the functional role of this feedback is still debated. Here we use a firing-rate model, the extended difference-of-Gaussians (eDOG) model, to explore cortical feedback effects on visual responses of dLGN relay cells. For this model the responses are found by direct evaluation of two- or three-dimensional integrals allowing for fast and comprehensive studies of putative effects of different candidate organizations of the cortical feedback.

If you\u2019re not familiar, Geoje is a small island off the east coast, near Busan. It has some lovely beaches and can be accessed by bridge, making it easier to travel to than some other Korean islands (such as Jeju and Oedo).\nMost tourist information focuses on how to get to Geoje from Seoul. However, this account will be from Daejeon, in central Korea. There is a direct bus from Daejeon to Geoje. It can be caught from the Express Bus Terminal and is 18,000KRW (about $16.50). The bus ride itself took about 3 hours. From the terminal in Geoje, I recommend finding a love motel \u2013 we paid 70,000KRW a night for a \u201cVIP\u201d room with two double beds. The hotel that we stayed in was called Maldives (\ub9d0\ub2e4\uc774\ube0c\uc2a4) and was near to the terminal; the bus terminal in Geoje is also the starting location for city buses, so this is where you will go to catch a bus to the beach.\n1. Gujora (\uad6c\uc870\ub77c) beach. You can catch a bus from the bus terminal; it will take about an hour. There are many buses that lead to Gujora. Check the screen at the bus terminal. The cost will be about 1,100 KRW (less than a dollar).\n2. Oedo (\uc678\ub3c4 ) island Botania botanical gardens. Oedo can only be accessed by ferry. The costs of ferry (return) plus the garden admissions are 26,000 per person. You can take a city bus (1,100KRW) to the ferry site.\n3. Windy Hill (\uc2e0\uc120\ub300) is a hill with a windmill. The view is lovely and well worth the 1 hr bus ride.\nHave you been to Geoje?

As the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, I feel responsible,\" Moon said in a lunch meeting with retired military leaders at Cheong Wa Dae.\nThe \"several recent incidents\" mentioned by Moon appeared to refer to last month's undetected arrival of a North Korean boat into a South Korean port and a false confession case involving a military manhunt.\nThe military was criticized for failing to detect the entry of a small wooden boat carrying four North Koreans into Samcheok Port on the east coast on June 15. In early July, a sailor was forced to make a false confession after an unidentified person was spotted inside the Navy's Second Fleet Command in Pyeongtaek, 70 kilometers south of Seoul.\nSome political watchers say Moon virtually expressed regret for the recent military incidents by mentioning responsibility, amid growing attention on the fate of Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo in an imminent Cabinet reshuffle expected next month. But other watchers speculate Jeong is unlikely to be replaced as the president stressed the minister's role in coping with the incidents. The rival parties have been fiercely at odds over Jeong's fate, with the main opposition Liberty Korea Party calling for his immediate dismissal.\nMoon stressed a virtuous cycle of strong defensive power, a solid South Korea-U.S. alliance, peace on the Korean Peninsula and economic growth in the lunch meeting attended by leading members of the Korea Veterans Association, the Korea Retired Generals and Admirals Association and the Korea Military Academy Alumni Association.\n\"A virtuous cycle of peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula will lead to the creation of a new order of cooperation in Northeast Asia, as well as between the two Koreas, and contribute greatly to regional co-prosperity in East Asia,\" Moon said.\n\"We can declare the opening of the new Korean Peninsula system only if the dialogue between North Korea and the United States leads to complete denuclearization, the normalization of their relations and the replacement of the armistice agreement with a peace treaty,\" he said.<|endoftext|>"

Japanese officials cautioned the residents to stay indoors to avoid radiation sickness.\nAccording to its national energy plan confirmed in August 2008, the Korean government aims to supply 41 percent of the country\u2019s energy requirements with nuclear power by 2030 from the current 23.3 percent.\nKorea has a total of 21 commercial facilities in operation and is building seven more.\nWith government inspection under way on new construction sites, three regions -- Samcheok in Gangwon Province, Youngdeok and Uljin in North Gyeongsang Province -- are currently competing to win the bid to run more nuclear power plants.\nHowever, opposition from the residents near atomic facilities and even in the candidate cities is getting fiercer amid a widening nuclear power crisis in Japan.\nAlong with environmentalists and civic groups, they plan to hold a meeting Wednesday to discuss follow-up plans.\n\u201cThe Japanese government is not providing enough information on radiation leaks while the Korean government is repeating that Korea is safe,\u201d said a civic group member.\n\u201cThis accident broke the myth about the safety of nuclear power,\u201d he said, demanding the withdrawal of all pending construction plans.\nOpposition lawmakers also called for a stronger government surveillance system and reinforcement for buildings to endure a 9.0-magnitude earthquake, the size of the tremor that devastated Japan on Friday.\n\u201cWe should stop building more nuclear plants. Our facilities are designed less earthquake-resistant than those in Japan,\u201d said Rep. Lee Chung-hee, chairwoman of the Democratic Labor Party.\nHowever, the government and the ruling Grand National Party downplayed fears about Korean nuclear power plants.\nIn a report submitted to the National Assembly on Monday, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology said that Korean nuclear plants are designed to remain intact when directly hit by an earthquake of up to 6.5 on the Richter scale.\n\u201cWe are designating the construction sites considering the activity of earthquake and fault structure within 320 kilometers,\u201d the report said.\nAnother important difference between Korean facilities and the Fukushima plant is the structure of their reactors.\nUnlike the \u201cboiling water reactor\u201d of the Fukushima nuclear plant, which was built in 1971, most Korean facilities have adopted \u201cpressurized water reactor,\u201d which has three separate cooling systems, which reduces the risk of accidents.\nThe government\u2019s explanations do not seem to have relieved public anxiety as Japan, which is still considered to be best-prepared for earthquakes and to have the world\u2019s most advanced nuclear power technology, is struggling to prevent a meltdown at a quake hit plant.\nPresident Lee Myung-bak observed the regular civil defense training at the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters in the government complex Tuesday upon his arrival from a three-day visit to the United Arab Emirates.\n\u201cWe should tighten emergency drills in case of a nuclear crisis. Even though there is no need to be anxious, training should be carried out in our daily lives,\u201d Lee said in a videophone conversation with Lee Yong-tae, director general of the Weolseong Nuclear Power Generation plant in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province.\nThe government will start a large-scale inspection on the earthquake resistance of nuclear power plants and other fuel facilities nationwide. The investigation aims, among other things, to look into whether protection for all 21 atomic facilities that are supposed to endure a 7.5-magnitude earthquake works properly.\nIt will be the first time for such an inspection to be staged by a pan-governmental task force.<|endoftext|>"

But as time went by, the North\u2019s claims seemed to fit the facts.\nSouth Korean military officials said Monday that they believed a 24-year-old man surnamed Kim, who fled here from the North in 2017, had swum to the North from the western island of Ganghwado after going through a drain under double barbed-wire fences installed to guard against infiltrators. The drain leads to a Han River estuary adjacent to the Yellow Sea.\nNear the drain they found a bag they believe is Kim\u2019s. At its closest point, Ganghwado is only about 1.3 kilometers from North Korea.\nThe South is obligated to protect North Koreans who swim to Ganghwado with the intention of defecting. But infiltrators and wanted criminals must not be allowed to come through undetected.\nIt is concerning that the South Korean military authorities hurriedly checked North Korea\u2019s claims about the incident only after the news report came out.\nAccording to the North\u2019s report, the man had previously \u201cescaped\u201d to the South but crossed the demarcation line July 19 to return to the North. The South Korean military authorities were in the dark for about a week. If not for the North\u2019s report, they would not even have known what happened. That means they also cannot know who may be infiltrating the South from the North.\nThe military demarcation line must be perfectly guarded, but it was breached easily by a North Korean defector. Kim reportedly swam to Gyodongdo, another island near Ganghwado, when he defected to the South. If a North Korean civilian managed to cross the demarcation line twice, undetected, how much easier would it be for a trained North Korean spy to infiltrate the South?\nThis is not the first time the line has been breached. In October 2012, a North Korean soldier crossed the border unchecked and knocked on the door of a South Korean guard post in Goseong, Gangwon Province, asking to defect. In June last year, North Koreans on a fishing boat entered the port of Samcheok, Gangwon Province, and also asked to defect. Their boat reached the pier without being detected.\nWhenever the military fails to detect an illegal crossing, they vow to prevent a recurrence. However, similar incidents keep happening. The holes that make the border porous must be identified and filled.\nKim\u2019s return to the North also exposed slack management on the part of the South Korean police, who are in charge of monitoring North Korean defectors.\nThe police failed to determine Kim\u2019s whereabouts until they saw the news report from the North. They are now embroiled in controversy over signs that he planned to go back to North Korea. The police say they received no such information, but one of Kim\u2019s acquaintances says she tipped off the police on several occasions.\nFurthermore, Kim was accused of raping another North Korean defector, yet the police did little about it even after receiving DNA evidence from the National Forensic Service on July 4. The police eventually requested an arrest warrant and banned Kim from leaving the country -- but only after he had gone back to the North.\nIf the military and the police had their operations in order, this incident might not have happened.\nNorth Korea said it was taking \u201cmaximum\u201d emergency precautions against the coronavirus after a defector returned with coronavirus symptoms. This claim is hard to verify. South Korean health officials said Kim was not registered as a COVID-19 patient, nor was there any evidence that he ever came into contact with anyone who\u2019d tested positive.\nIf the coronavirus has spread across North Korea, South Korea may offer humanitarian help. But any attempt by the North to shift responsibility to the South must be blocked.<|endoftext|>"

Kim Dongyeop 9p came short 12.5 points after his central stones fell under fire, for KH Energy to comeback into the match.

Kang Hun 9p collected his fifth consecutive win, the only player to do so so far apart from Seo Bongsoo 9p, Cho Chikun 9p eyeing him in the match with Sangju against whom to achieve the same feat.\nIn fixture three, Jimmy Cha 5p found his fourth victory of the season, for Seo Bongsoo 9p to follow 70 seconds later with a win by overcoming Kim Dongyeop 9p. Paek Seongho 9p's match deciding victory over Kim Soojang 9p let Sangju slide up to second, two match points and one board point behind the leaders KH Energy.\nWhile a potential showdown between the two top players of each team didn't arise, it was nevertheless a major moment in the league as Sangju see second place by ending the sweep of the defending champions. Kim Kihun 7p and Seo Bongsoo 9p stepped up to clasp the match against opponents Kang Hun 9p and Chang Suyeong 9p respectively, but Paek Seongho 9p stole the show by turning around the game against Cho Chikun 9p. In fixture two, Kim Chongsu 8p swept white on the lower left side to take the win from Kim JongJoon 7p, followed by a phenomenal struggle for life on the right ending successfully for Kim Ilhwan 9p.

In South Korea, the east coast and Jeju Island have especially been a focus because the area of barren ground increases in spite of continual efforts to install artificial reefs. This study approached the urchin barrens issue in South Korea, by focusing on a correlational analysis of urchin and macroalgal abundance. Urchin density and algal species coverage were obtained using a quadrat image analysis. Subtidal sites were then classified into three groups according to the average densities of urchins to evaluate the characterization of the macroalgal community: no urchin (NU) zone; transition (TR) zone, 4 inds. m -2 ; and urchin (UR) zone, \u22658 inds. m -2. The average urchin density in the study site was 4.7 inds. m -2 and 57 macroalgal species were found in the study site. From the NU zone to UR zone, total species number, species diversity index and evenness gradually decreased, whereas the dominance index increased. The algae species with negative correlations were Grateloupia divaricata, Polysiphonia morrowii, Chondracanthus intermedius, Delesseria violacea, Desmarestia viridis ; and those with positive correlations were the crustose corallines, Sargassum horneri. Other species were not significantly correlated with urchin density. The significant correlations indicate that the abundance of some macroalgal species is proportionally regulated by sea urchin density. This study also shows how macroalgal vegetation changes in response to an urchin\u2019s density gradient in a natural condition; and there is a TR zone that existed with respect to an intermediate level of algal abundance.\nUrchin barrens have been a major coastal environmental issue in temperate regions ( Klumpp et al. 1993, Guidetti and Dul\u010di\u0107 2007, Privitera et al. 2008, Agnetta et al. 2013 ). Various factors have been raised for the reasons of the barren ground phenomena, such as climate changes, marine pollutions, intensive herbivory, etc. ( Arai and Arai 1984, Watanabe and Harrold 1991 ). Regarding herbivory actions, a magnitude of sea urchin density has been closely related with the severity of barrens in many parts of coastal beds ( Mann 1982, Guidetti and Dul\u010di\u01072007, Privitera et al. 2008, Agnetta et al. 2013 ).\nIn general, the standing biomass of erect and fleshy macroalgae is low where urchins remain in a substantial density, and sometimes algal-rich beds have distinctively separated from those barren spots, even though the distance is only a few meters ( Choat and Schiel 1982, Mann 1982, Dean et al. 2000, Wright et al. 2005, Stewart and Konar 2012 ). Despite strong grazing pressure, insufficient food supply has been proved in those biologically unprotected habitats because of low recruitment success and high mortality of young thalli ( Harrold and Reed 1985, Agatsuma 2007, Yoo et al. 2007 ). Hence, the pattern often persists for a long time. Nevertheless, with regard to sea urchins distributional patterns, they tend to be gregarious in those barren spots with little food ( Mann 1982, Vadas et al. 1986, Nakabayashi et al. 2006, Guidetti and Dul\u010di\u0107 2007, Stewart and Konar 2012 ); this leads to some further questions. Is it a group protection from predators? A good shelter from wave action? A certain behavioral pattern of sea urchins? ( Mann 1982, Vadas et al. 1986, Dean et al. 2000, Dumont et al. 2006, Stewart and Konar 2012, Morse and Hunt 2013 ). Vadas (1977) and Mann (1982) claimed that macroalgae-herbivore interactions have led to important adaptations and strategies by both the sea urchins and algae, emphasizing algae\u2019s temporal (e.g., short-lived) and spatial (e.g., patchy) escape and urchin\u2019s efficient search and mobility for available prey. From another point of view, Agnetta et al. (2013) explained that sea urchin grazing often determined the formation and maintenance of two alternative states (coralline barrens and erect algal forests) of a macroalgal community in temperate rocky reefs. However, except for many researches dealing with urchin\u2019s feeding experiments, field distributional patterns of sea urchins and their prey are still remained quite conceptual.\nThis non-manipulative experiment was carried out to understand the relationship between macroalgal abundance and sea urchin density in a natural habitat, where both coralline barrens and an erect algal forest exist with a transition zone between the two types. The present study provides a layout of the natural field conditions and further questions on feeding patterns and behavior of urchins in the particular barren subtidal habitat.\nThe study site is located in Jangho village, Samcheok City, Gangwon Province, South Korea (37\u00b017.025\u02b9 N, 129\u00b019.358\u02b9 E) ( Fig. 1 ). The subtidal zone (6-10 m in depth) of this area, where the experiment was conducted, represents a typical urchin barrens habitat on the east coast of South Korea. The field data were collected from April 12 to May 23, 2013, using by means of SCUBA diving. Two species of sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus nudus and S. intermedius, dominate the grazer populations with an occasional occurrence of erect foliose macroalgal beds.\nThe study site, Jangho, Gangwon Province, South Korea.\nThe ratio of the relative percent coverage of crustose coralline algae and erect foliose algae is 60 : 40 in average, with more foliose algae appearing in the shallower zone and more corallines in the deeper zone ( Jeon 2013 ). The sea urchin density and macroalgal percent cover were obtained from a random quadrat (0.5 m \u00d7 0.5 m, n = 170), using a transect line marked with random points, which was placed along the ur<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "South Korea has twice hosted the Olympic Games and each time the national government has used redevelopment for the Games to erase its past, mediate tensions in the present, and materialize a new future. It did this in 1988 with the Summer Olympics in Seoul, and it has been taking a similar approach with the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Kangw\u014fn Province. As the South Korean government repeats a history of erasure and development in the present, collaborative housing, rural renewal, and agricultural projects in Kangw\u014fn remind us that there are better\u2014and perhaps more lasting\u2014ways to bring economic, social, and cultural vitality to a region.\nIn the years leading to the 1988 Seoul Olympics, Chun Doo-Hwan, the authoritarian president of South Korea in the early 1980s, envisioned the Summer Olympics as a way to show the world that South Korea had become a prosperous, \u201cmodern\u201d country equal to those in the West. At the time, Chun faced pressure domestically from a growing pro-democracy movement. He and his supporters also envisioned the Olympics as a way to draw national attention away from Chun\u2019s authoritarian rule.\nWinning the bid in 1981, Chun and his supporters pushed forward despite strident opposition to their redevelopment plans for Seoul. Some of the most notable city beautification projects included re-landscaping the Han River, building several new subway lines, and constructing the Olympic Stadium and new housing for athletes. In the process, Chun\u2019s government removed or remade large portions of the city\u2019s natural and built environment. Historic buildings, neighborhoods, and natural features were erased to make way for the modern future envisioned by Chun and his supporters.\nThe Olympic Bridge crossing the Han River in Seoul, one of many large-scale projects begun in anticipation of the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Image courtesy of Wikimedia Commons.\nThis process of erasure was often violent, as Sukjong Hong and others have explained. Residents of poorer neighborhoods, for instance, were forcibly removed from their homes to make way for new construction. The government outsourced such \u201crelocation\u201d projects to private companies who used armed thugs and gang members to attack residents and force them to comply with eviction notices. In demolishing 48,000 homes, Chun\u2019s government forced 720,000 people to relocate to other parts of Korea. Additionally, under a \u201cpurification campaign,\u201d 16,000 unattended children, disabled people, panhandlers, homeless people, and political dissidents were removed from the city streets and locked in institutions.\nWith the 1988 Olympics, South Korean government officials and business leaders argued that the country had achieved the dream of entering the top echelon of nation-states. In reality, however, Seoul was the only part of South Korea with access to the more prosperous future created by the Games. The outcome of the government\u2019s dream of solidifying national prosperity through the Olympics was far from uniform.\nTo host the 1988 Olympics, Chun\u2019s government mobilized precious capital and resources to develop Seoul, resources not available to other parts of the country. As government and business leaders concentrated the country\u2019s wealth within the capital city, redeveloping Seoul to take its place on the international stage as host for the Olympics, other regions in South Korea had fewer and fewer opportunities for similar development projects. In the process, Seoul sucked resources and people from other regions, draining the provinces of capital and manpower. Seoul drew South Koreans from other regions because the city was perceived not only as the foremost Korean city but also as a leading global city\u2014precisely the impression Chun hoped to establish through the 1988 Olympics.\nThree decades after the 1988 Olympics, nearly half of the country\u2019s population resides in Seoul.\nToday, three decades after the 1988 Olympics, nearly half of the country\u2019s population resides in Seoul, and it is the political, economic, and cultural capital of South Korea. With the headquarters of Samsung, Hyundai and LG, Seoul is known globally as a cosmopolitan city, the center of K-Pop, Korean dramas and films, and the leader in Korean cuisine and design. Foreign shows and documentaries feature Seoul and its culture as the representative of South Korean culture.\nBut Seoul is not the only city or cultural capital in South Korea. As the tenth largest economy in the world, Korea is also home to Pusan, Incheon, and Kwangju, cities with vibrant economies and cultural life that, outside of Seoul\u2019s shadow, would compare favorably to other global cities. Yet, these cities cannot compete with Seoul economically, politically, and culturally\u2014not with Seoul\u2019s high concentration of capital, people, and resources. Though uneven development existed before the Olympics, this division between Seoul and the rest of the country was exaggerated by the investments made in the 1988 Olympic Games.\nThe unevenness of South Korean development is never more apparent than in the differences between Seoul and the rural areas where the current Olympics take place. Pyeongchang is located in Kangw\u014fn Province, an area that has been under severe economic strain since the 1980s.\nKangw\u014fn Province was the center of Korea\u2019s coal mining industry. The Samcheok Coal Field in southeastern Kangw\u014fn Province once supplied nearly 65% of the country\u2019s total domestic coal production. When mines closed under the 1980\u2019s Coal Industrial Rationalization Policy, the economy of Kangw\u014fn declined dramatically. In addition to the continuing loss of mining jobs, coal production fundamentally reshaped the natural environment of the region, and the streams, creeks and other bodies of water in the province are now heavily polluted.\nSouth Korean miners at the entrance to a Kangw\u014fn Province coal mine. Image courtesy of Wikimedia Commons.\nIn addition to the failing coal industry, farming communities in the region have also suffered since the 1980s. For example, residents of the kibbutz-style agricultural collectives along the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) began reclaiming the war-ravaged landscape in the 1960s and eventually built working farms near the border, as Eleana J. Kim explains. This was no small accomplishment, since farmers often suffered massive wounds or died from landmines planted by South Korean and American troops. However, when the national government reneged on a promise to repay the farmers\u2019 labor with land ownership, members of farming collectives became permanent tenant farmers. With the decline of the agricultural industry in South Korea overall, farming communities across Kangw\u014fn, especially along the border, grew even more precarious and depopulated.\nSince the 1980s, national and local leaders have tried to revive the province through new forms of industry, especially tourism. Kangw\u014fn\u2019s beautiful landscape and the famous Mount Taebaek have made it a major domestic tourist attraction for outdoor activities, such as hiking, skiing, snowboarding, and visiting Buddhist temples. Tourism, however, cannot compensate for the loss of domestic coal production or failing agricultural markets, and the region continues to struggle despite these efforts.\nThis is the context for South Korean\u2019s 2018 Olympic aspirations for Kangw\u014fn province. Residents of the province yearn for the Olympics to spark economic recovery, while national and business leaders dream of overcoming unevenness and thus proving that all of South Korea has access to the prosperity visible in Seoul.\nKangw\u014fn\u2019s national parks, including Chiaksan pictured above, have helped drive the provincial tourist economy. Image courtesy of Wikimedia Commons.\nAggressively bidding to host the Olympics twice before, in 2011 Pyeongchang finally won the contest to host the 2018 Games. Throughout the bidding processes, national leaders stressed that winning the bid to hold the Games would start a process of economic development to raise the fortunes of the region and the living standards of its residents.\nIn many ways, the previous Olympics became a model for the present Games.\nIn many ways, the previous Olympics became a model for the present Games. For example, with the new Games, the government has promised that a more prosperous Kangw\u014fn would join Seoul on the international stage. To pull the region up to that stage of development, politicians assured voters that they would deliver $20 billion in investments that would create 230,000 jobs for the region. Like in the early 1980s, between 2011 and the present South Koreans have spoken about the Olympics as bringing even more economic prosperity and prestige to the country.\nUnlike the previous Olympics, where the human inhabitants of Seoul\u2019s streets and poor neighborhoods were the primary targets of redevelopment, in Kangw\u014fn, the natural environment has become the main object of transformation. The most devastating environmental consequence of realizing the new Kangw\u014fn has been the construction of a new ski area over protected forests on the slopes of Mt. Gariwangsan. The deforestation of the area caused an uproar because the forest has been one of the most important and oldest woodlands in South Korea. Here, the past that was embodied in elements of the natural environment, like a protected woodland, was erased to make way for an Olympic future. Rather than relying on the Olympic Games to bring renewal to this rural region, there are better and more lasting models to follow.\nThe enormous redevelopment projects required to host the Olympics invite host countries to overlook potentially more effective efforts that address present realities. In Kangw\u014fn Province, local projects have pursued avenues of social and economic renewal that incorporated the past as well as the pre-existing in order to create new futures in the present.\nThe cover of a recent work profiling architect Chu D<|endoftext|>"

The poll has a plus or minus 0.8 percentage point margin of error.\nIn a separate exit poll conducted by broadcaster JTBC, Lee, 57, a former Gyeonggi Province Governor, is expected to garner 48.4 percent of the votes compared to Yoon's 47.7 percent. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.2 percentage points.\nThe exit poll by the three broadcasters showed that Lee drew overwhelming support from the Jeolla provinces and voters in their 40s. He earned 83.7 percent of votes from South Jeolla Province, 83.3 percent from Gwangju, and 82.6 percent from North Jeolla Province.\nYoon, on the other hand, enjoyed markedly strong support in the Gyeongsang provinces and by those in their 60s. Over 72 percent of voters in Daegu, 72.1 percent in North Gyeongsang Province, and 57.8 percent in Busan supported him.\nThe region-specific trend was also visible in the result of the other exit poll conducted by JTBC. Lee received the support of 86.5 percent of voters in Gwangju and South Jeolla, whereas 71.8 percent of voters in Daegu and North Gyeongsang supported Yoon.\nThe broadcasters' exit poll also showed that over 60 percent of voters in their 40s supported Lee compared to Yoon's 35.4 percent. But among those in their 60s, 67.1 percent supported Yoon compared to 30.8 percent for Lee.\nAnother contrasting result came from those in their 20s, as each gender group was more inclined towards a different candidate. Among male voters, 58.7 percent supported Yoon, while 58 percent of female voters supported Lee.\nJTBC's exit poll showed a similar result. Yoon received 56.5 percent of votes from male voters aged 18-29, while 60.2 percent of female voters of the same age group supported Lee.\nThe exit poll showed voters in the greater Seoul area remain divided in their choice of candidates. Yoon is ahead of Lee in Seoul, while Lee is slightly ahead of Yoon in Gyeonggi Province and Incheon.\nAccording to the NEC, as of 7:30 p.m., total voter turnout was estimated at 77.1 percent, including 36.93 percent who participated in early voting held May 4 and 5. The turnout for the previous election in 2017 stood at 77.2 percent, and the highest turnout ever in the presidential election was 89.2 percent in 1987.\nThe NEC is expected to confirm the election result Thursday morning. If the winner is confirmed, a presidential transition team will be formed within two to three weeks. The president-elect will be sworn in as Korea's new leader on May 10 for a five-year tenure which will end on May 9, 2027.\nVoting began across 14,464 polling stations nationwide at 6 a.m. and continued until 6 p.m., Wednesday, after which voters infected with the coronavirus cast their ballots at the polling booths from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.\nWhoever is elected as the country's new leader, the new president will face various issues ranging from deepening social conflicts to slowing economic growth and diplomatic challenges involving major countries.\nMost of all, the new leader will have to place top priority on integrating a country that was sharply divided during the past 22 days of campaigning. As polls taken before the election show, the nation was poles apart between those who support the liberal DPK and the conservative PPP and finding a common ground between them seems to be tough due to huge differences between the two sides on most issues.\nDuring the presidential election campaigning that started in 2021, the two major parties and their candidates, Lee Jae-myung of the DPK and the PPP's Yoon Suk-yeol, traded salvos with verbal attacks so harsh and groundless many called this campaign \"the ugliest presidential election ever.\"\nOther variables were at play during the latest election.\nDue to the highly-contagious trait of the Omicron variant, the country once again saw record-breaking daily COVID-19 infection cases on Election Day, surging by 140,000 from the previous day to over 342,000. The health issue is one of the concerns that might affect the country's overall voting rate as increasing members of the public are shunning public places including polling stations.\nThe NEC made blunders during the early voting period, when workers at several polling stations in Seoul, Busan and Daegu collected ballots from coronavirus-infected voters in plastic bags, cardboard boxes and other unofficial containers rather than letting them cast their votes directly in designated ballot boxes.\nThat drew the ire of COVID-19 infected voters who mistrusted what the officials will do with their ballots. Lawmakers from both the PPP and the DPK also criticized the agency's chairperson Noh Jeong-hee for the mishap.\nA large forest fire in the country's mountainous region on the east coast that has been continuing for days also disrupted the voting process.\nAs of Wednesday, the fire has burned or affected a total of over 18,671 hectares of woodland near Gangneung and Donghae, and displaced some 420 people. While 70 percent of the fire has been controlled as of Wednesday morning, the blaze still continued in Uljin and Samcheok in North Gyeongsang Province. The local governments arranged buses so that those who lost their homes in the fire and are temporarily staying in local community centers can get to polling stations.\nThe campaigns for this year's<|endoftext|>"

Previous studies focused on the economy of scale through geographical concentration, analysis of clusters from social composition perspective, and local innovation systems and competitiveness seen from industrial environment problem aspect or business plan aspect [22]- [24]. Therefore, this study was set to empirically look for developing strategies on Fire and Emergency's Industry of region for cluster, specially we looked for the best strategy. This study tries to examine the theoretical base of cluster concept, find the indices for strategic methods for the establishment of desirable clusters, and present policy implications through priorities AHP techniques. It is expected that this study will contribute to the exploration and development of policy support tools and development direction to reinforce Korea's competitiveness in the future.\n\nTheory and practice of industrial cluster\nAs Cluster was used as an analytical concept for the competitive advantage of a country or region in the past. In the 1990s, it was used as a key policy tool by OECD and other countries. A cluster is a geographical and relational aggregate that represents the relationship between buyer and supplier vertically and the relationship between customer, technology and channel horizontally [12]. Internally, these components are connected and the formal and informal interactions between these are important. In this context, the growth of competitive local economy is the result of concentration of geographically closely located companies through networks [2], [18]. The key for the establishment of cluster is to strengthen cooperation in a certain industry already concentrated in a region and related universities, companies and research institutions and improve its competitiveness. To improve local competitiveness through industrial clusters, it is necessary to specialize in one or several industries by using the research and business startup support of the related agencies, attracting excellent companies at home and abroad, and strengthening cooperation between companies, universities, and research centers. In this sense, an industrial cluster is a total industrial system, in which industrial production system, science and technology system and corporate support system function inter-connectedly, as companies in certain industry are geographically concentrated.\nCommonalities and complementarities in a region are emphasized for an industrial cluster as a system. However, analyses of industrial clusters in Korea showed that they are in their early development stage, network formation is limited and access to support system is difficult, therefore commonalities and complementarities are urgently needed [11].\n\n2 Components of Fire &Emergency industry cluster\nIn his book, \"The Competitive Advantage of Nations,\" Professor Michael Porter pointed out the cluster phenomenon as a common characteristics of competitive countries and emphasized the importance of spatial proximity and the anchoring of firms in their home base as key factors for economic development. He defined a cluster as \"A geographically proximate group of companies and associated institutions in a particular field linked by commonalities and complementarities.\" The key of a cluster is the establishment of cooperative network of independent production companies, part and raw material suppliers, final consumers, and user companies that are linked in a production chain that creates added value. Base on this, he explains external elements and internal elements of the cluster model. External elements include the chance in domestic and international markets and government capabilities. The internal elements consist of four; first is factor conditions that include human, material, and knowledge resources and social infrastructure; second is the conditions by which a firm is formed, organized, and operated and competition conditions that include firm strategy, structure, and rivalry; third is related and supporting industries, which means the existence of any internationally competitive industries among the related or supported industries; and fourth is demand conditions that include demand market, structure, growth pattern, globalized demands, and requirements of consumers.\nThe elements for cluster described above are important elements for the establishment of the Fire & Emergency industry cluster. Because Fire & Emergency industry is influenced by the role of National Fire & Emergency Management Agency(government capabilities), creation of competitive infrastructure(factor conditions), consumption environment(demand conditions), and production environment(corporate condition, and information and communication technology (related industry environment).\n\nAnalysis model\nTo give weight to evaluation indices using Analytical Hierarchy Process(AHP), it is necessary to develop an evaluation index system and set a hierarchy deductively. This study examines the policy indices for the establishment of  [8], therefore this study examines the policy to create Fire and Emergency industry cluster by Samcheok-si and classify it into policy, supply, demands, and network elements.\nFirst, Policy elements is that Cluster map is Preparation of overall index of the existence of specialized industry and core industry, existence and level of support organizations, and existence of part companies, and competition relationship, Cluster branding is Preparation of PR and communication strategies for Fire and Emergency industry cluster(Brand for local cluster), and, Policy incentives to internationalize the cluster and strengthen link is Development of policy, implementation capabilities, budget size, strategies to secure local competitiveness, and policy incentives such as reduced rent and tax benefits to integrate, combine, and localize domestic and foreign technology to establish Fire and Emergency industry cluster.\nSecond, Supply elements is that Market potential of cluster is Customer development with foreign countries and domestic superior enterprise, support institution, school, research institute for Fire and Emergency industry cluster, Core International Journal of Contents, Vol. 5, No.3, Sep 2009 infrastructure is Concentration of core infrastructure(roads, railroads, communication, and ports) necessary for the project, and, Establishment of hinterland is Preparation of sufficient hinterland(city center and shopping area) for the establishment of Fire and Emergency industry cluster.\nThird, Demand elements is Development of market concentration is Focusing on attracting excellent companies, support organizations, universities, and research centers to meet customer requirements, Support of venture startup companies is Preparation to support venture startup companies(Provide offices and help with starting business) for the establishment of Fire and Emergency industrial cluster, and, Establishment of specialized labor pool is Creation of labor pool for special education and actual work for Fire and Emergency industry.\nFinally, Network elements is that Link between components is Establishment of link between financial and information support, technology and labor provision, part and element technology, Formation of distributed network of related local industries is Establishment of interrelationship between companies and institutions by inducing the cluster components to focus on their core capabilities and procure other things through network, and, Sharing of organizational culture to cope with changes in environment is Establishment of systematic information collection network to check industry trend and changes in environment anytime, Supply of convenient administrative and support service, Supply of convenient administrative and other support services (finance, insurance, law, and consulting), Creation of group learning culture is Companies, universities, and research centers provide learning opportunities and create group learning culture to create and transfer vision and knowledge.  (2007) Creation of labor pool for special education and actual work for Fire and Emergency industry\n\nSurvey design and hierarchy\nThe purpose of this study is to establish the direction for local Fire & Emergency industry cluster policy. For this purpose, this study carries out an empirical analysis through a survey of experts and the data collection and analysis method are as follows. First, to set a priority and weight using AHP, a survey of experts on the establishment methods of local Fire and Emergency industry strategies is carried out. Second, a questionnaire for the survey is organized so that comparison of elements according to the hierarchy is easy, and the pair wise comparison uses 9 point scale. Third, the analysis is done according to AHP and Excel 2007 is used for statistics.\nTo collect data, a questionnaire is designed with items appropriate for AHP analysis and a survey of experts using the questionnaire is conducted. It is because the survey for AHP analysis is very complicated and it requires accurate answers. And interviews with 11 experts in the Fire & Emergency field including central and local government officers, industry experts, field workers, policy experts, and business owners are conducted. Hierarchical indices discussed above are as follows. The questions can be difficult for the interviewees to understand and similar questions could bore them. So the questions are made as easy as possible to understand. The scale needs to be made to reflect the difference a person feels as much as possible in the pair wise comparison. According to Miller's psychological experiment done in 1956, \"Humans can compare to things simultaneously without getting confused.\" [19] Based on this, the scale consists of 1 to 9 or 9 to 1. These numbers are closely related to daily language expression as follows.\nCurrently the considerations for the establishment of local Fire & Emergency industry cluster have not been established theoretically and they are affected by various complicated factors. Thus, AHP can be very useful for the integrated strategic decision making for the policy.\n\nMeasurement of importance and scale\nWe used the AHP to analyze this study. The weight for each sub index is calculated by pair wise comparison. Relative point of the comparing item against the base item is coded for the collected survey data. To the range better than the standard item, a point between 1-9 is given and the reverse number is given to a item in the opposite range. When there are n number of elements, and they are called A 1, A 2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, An and their importance is W 1, W 2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7,Wn, Matrix A obtained from pair wise comparison can be expressed as follows [19]- [21], [23].  Fig.3\n\n. Formation of Matrix A\nThe importance is called priority, which can be obtained from pair wise comparison. Priority is calculated by using eigen vector and eigen value of matrix that consists of pairwise comparison. When a group participates in the importance evaluation, importance can be decided by the agreement of the group. However, if individuals decide the importance, geometric mean can be used. It is symmetrical reverse performance. The reciprocal of geometric mean of multiple numbers is the same as the metric mean of the reciprocals of the numbers. In making the matrix, cardinal consistency as well as ordinal performance are not assumed. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the cardinal consistency to verify the level of logical inconsistency of matrix.<|endoftext|>"
