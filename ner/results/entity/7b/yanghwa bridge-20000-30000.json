Though his parents were initially against him becoming a singer, Daesung pursued his passion and successfully passed his audition at YG Entertainment. He debuted with BIGBANG on August 19, 2006 alongside Taeyang, G-Dragon, T.O.P, and Seungri.\nSoon after his debut with BIGBANG Daesung developed vocal chord nodules, which led him to struggle with his voice and develop stage fright. With the help of then-label mate Gummy, who suffered the same condition, Daesung eventually overcame his condition. Along with various group activities with BIGBANG, Daesung also pursued a solo career, interestingly enough, as a trot singer. He released his first trot single, \"Look at Me, Gwisoon\" in 2008 followed by \"Big Hit\" in 2009.\nIn August 2009, Daesung was injured in a car accident while returning to Seoul from filming a reality show. The accident occurred when the van hit the guard rail and skidded in the pouring rain. Daesung, who was sitting in the passenger seat, suffered a broken nose, a back injury, and sustained minor contusions on his arms and legs. Daesung was fully covered by October 2009, and rejoined BIGBANG for promotions starting then.\nOn May 31, 2011, Daesung was involved in another car accident, this time while at the wheel. The accident occurred while Daesung was driving home at approximately 1:30am one night. An intoxicated motorcyclist crashed his bike on Yanghwa Bridge, and while the car immediately in front of Daesung swerved to avoid the man laying in the street, Daesung did not have time to react and ran over him and hit a parked taxi that had seen him and pulled over. The motorcyclist had a high blood-alcohol content level of 0.18, likely the cause of his crash. For some time time it was unsure as to whether or not he was already dead when Daesung hit him. However, after a long period of deliberation and an extensive autopsy, forensic specialists found that the motorcyclist was indeed alive before Daesung hit him, and that Daesung was responsible for his death. Despite this, the investigation cleared Daesung of all charges, finding that the accident was not his fault as he was not intoxicated, though he was speeding.\nFollowing the accident, Daesung remained underground for 6 months, making no appearances and releasing no new material. He made his first public appearance at the MTV European Music Awards in November 2011, and made a comeback with BIGBANG in March 2012 with their new mini album, Alive.\nDaesung released his first Japanese solo album in February 2013, and has been consistently successful in Japan since. He has released 3 solo albums (two of which peaked at #1 on the Oricon chart) and headlined multiple Japanese tours as a solo artist over the past three years.<|endoftext|>Lapayre, J. C.\nWe describe a new Watermarking system of medical information security and terminal mobile phone adaptation for PocketNeuro project. The later term refers to a Project created for the service of neurological diseases. It consists of transmitting information about patients \\\"Desk of Patients\\\" to a doctor\\'s mobile phone when he is visiting or examining his patient. This system is capable of embedding medical information inside diagnostic images for security purposes. Our system applies JPEG Compression to Watermarked images to adapt them to the doctor\\'s mobile phone. Experiments performed on a database of 30-256x256 pixel-sized neuronal images show that our Watermarking scheme for image security is robust against JPEG Compression. For the purpose of increasing the image Watermarking robustness against attacks for an image transmission and to perform a large data payload, we encode with Turbo-Code image-embedded bits information. Fidelity is improved by incorporation of the Relative Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (RPSNR) as a perceptual metric to measure image degradation.<|endoftext|>In broad terms, what was it you were looking for today?\nWho do you best represent?\nWhat type of land do you manage?\nAny others or a mixture?\nFeralScan is our interlinked community website and Smartphone App that allows you to map sightings of pest animals and record the problems they are causing in your local area.\nFeralScan can be used by farmers, community groups, pest controllers, local government, catchment groups and individuals managing pest animals and their impacts.\nFeralScan is a free resource that can be used by anyone to record pest animal activity, evidence of pests, pest damage, and control actions.

It can be an asset or perhaps the auto that you get. Various other lenders might provide you an unsecured loan. Here the danger variable is high so it is supplied at a higher price of passion. However as a result of high competitors a customer can even discuss the price of rate of interest.\nLow-cost auto loans are offered at a reasonably reduced rate of interest allowing you to pay for car.\nget a long term loan is a form of a secured loan where your automobile is to be promised as a safety. As the loan involves some danger, the loan providers choose to keep it as a secured loan. You have 2 settlement choices in this loan. The inexpensive automobile loans short-term and the affordable car loans long term. For the short-term loans the rate of interest is higher as compared to the Long Term Loans. You need to pay back the short term loans in about 5 years while for the long term loans you are provided a period of 20 years. The rates of interest can be decreased by certain quantities if you adopt the deposit.\nEconomic institutions such as financial institutions are currently making it so much easier for individuals to use cash money breakthroughs, some to the level of not going through history checks so they could lure people to apply for a loan.\nIf you yourself are not able to take treatment of the financial requirements of your organisation, unprotected business loans can be advantageous. If you are a business owner, you can find these loans at competitive interest rates by placing in some efforts. You need to decide your needs first and after that obtain any type of organisation loans.\nIf you can chat to your spouse and persuade her to allow go of gems or costly individual devices, see. This is most painful, however, one great means to obtain money in situation.\n, if you require rapid cash money these kinds of lending institutions can obtain you up to $1,500 within a pair hours.. They usually anticipate you to pay the money back over two pay periods, yet some companies give you as long as 100 days to pay the cash back. Make certain you select a business with payment terms you can deal with or you may want you had actually never ever taken out the loan.\nA larger deposit has the added advantage of eliminating lending institution\u2019s mortgage insurance coverage. Buyers who supply much less than a 20% deposit should pay loan provider\u2019s insurance. This can include hundreds of bucks to the regular monthly mortgage settlement.<|endoftext|>The Maybin Mission S2P (Streets to Peaks) program at Camp Grier provides year-round outdoor opportunities like backpacking, rock climbing, whitewater canoeing, and horseback riding to youth at no cost to their families.

Season 5 had some serious competition and although it didn\u2019t have the idol backing like the previous season, the popularity has been no joke. The Show Me The Money Concert Tour made a stop in Chicago and Los Angeles and was nothing short of AMAZING.\nEntering the Rosemont Theatre in Chicago, baseball caps filled the crowd at the 4,400 seated venue. Screams filled the room as promos for Crush\u2019s First Solo Tour teased the crowd as they anticipated the start of the show.\nAlthough Rosemont Theatre is all seated, everyone rose from their seats as soon as the concert started. SMTM riled up the crowd with an ode to old school hip-hop in a video graphic that featured New York-style graffiti and B-boying.\nThe crowd was already hyped but then Gil entered and accompanied Mad Clown in performing their special stage and the room filled with roars.\nAlthough Team Gil & Mad Clown were known for their awkward interactions this season, all of that was gone when they performed. Another video teaser started, and it became obvious that the teams would continue to perform in order of elimination from the show. That\u2019s when The Quiett entered the room. The crowd went wild as Illionaire has been quite popular in the U.S. for the past few years with their simple concept of providing no frills, hard hitting hip hop.\nIllionaire symbols filled the room and stayed up for Illionaire\u2019s full set of nine songs. Dok2 came on during the second song, \u201cBeverly Ills,\u201d which was obviously one of the crowd favorites.\nAlthough Dok2 and The Quiett had a longer set than most of the other performers, they kept their energy up and delivered their rhymes flawlessly. With their last song \u201c\uc5f0\uacb0\uace0\ub9ac (YGGR),\u201d they continuously built up the chorus which hyped up the crowd so much that the room was going insane! Thousands of voices repeated the lyrics until the duo left the stage.\nHe introduced his hit \u201cBeautiful\u201d by saying, \u201cDon\u2019t call me handsome boy, I\u2019m beautiful motherf**ker!\u201d and continued to do a four-song set.\nThe concert had been filled with hard hip-hop sounds all night and that\u2019s when Zion.T graced the stage with his soulful voice and popular song \u201c\ucff5 (Koong).\u201d The crowd went crazy as Zion.T hinted towards his three next songs and crowd kept guessing them right. Kush and C Jamm came back on for the SMTM hit \u201c Machine Gun\u201d before Zion. T finished with \u201cYanghwa Bridge.\u201d Of course Zion.T couldn\u2019t exit the stage without his signature bow.\nThe crowd had been anticipating the final team, AOMG, and when Gray hit the stage teasing the ladies with his \u201cSINGLE\u201d shirt and the whole room filled with screams. He performed \u201cDream Chaser\u201d and \u201cJust Do It\u201d solo before Simon D came on the stage.\nIt was obvious that Simon D was truly enjoying himself as he spoke English with the crowd. \u201cMusic is the one. Simon Dominic is the one.\u201d \u201cSimon Dominic is yours!\u201d and even made a fangirl\u2019s dream come true as he responded to her \u201cI love you\u201d with"

        "passage": "nae here offers a whole song himself making his passion for music known by his voice. You can feel his emotions while singing and its pretty much one of the best covers he have so far (in my preference).\nJungkook with Rap Monster (back then) released a pre-debut cover in 2012 of the song \"Like A Star\" by J.Cole. Hearing a young Jeongguk singing along in English with Namjoon here rapping sounds so nostalgic and impressive at the same time. With such an arrangement and sampling, in an early age, these two have already proven how talented they were - with so much potential and skills.\nDecember 29, 2015 - SoundCloud upload here. What I love about their collaboration is that they compliment each other's vocal ranges. Troye Sivan's song not only showcased Jungkook's versatility but as well as RM potential in singing and that he can deliver it clean and amazingly good.\nDecember 25, 2014 - A rendition of Justin Bieber's Mistletoe which lyrics were written and changed by Jimin himself. This is a pretty sweet and lovely carol from the two vocalists of the group. I find it impressive that Jungkook's voice can be this cute, relax and the whole change on the arrangement of the song despite sounds nice. It brings me back some childhood memories whenever I hear their giggling laugh at the end.\nYOU'RE MY with the full Vocal Line Jimin, Jin and V from original song of BIGBANG Taeyang.\nJeon Jungkook as BTS Main Vocalist and youngest member has participated the MBC Entertainment's THE KING OF MASK SINGER episode 71 last August 7, 2016 while singing to BIGBANG's \"If You\" and his beautiful live performance took over the crowd by a surprise. His interpretation of the song is amazing! I mean, he can even steal million of hearts just by his sweet voice even, to be very honest. On this link he was identified as the Golden Maknae.\nFrom the same episode of \"The King of Mask Singer\" Jungkook also sung with Lady Jane as Archery Girl. Their collaboration or rather 1on1 round was pretty impressive, hearing its studio version sounds beautiful and romantic. I'd be glad to hear him sing with other artists more, may it be female idols, I won't mind.\nAn original tweet from BTS Twitter page last September 24, 2014 was Jungkook's full recording or song cover or Zion.T's Yanghwa Bridge click here for the SoundCloud upload.\nOne year after, KBS World have Jungkook performed with Zion.T himself during the 2015 KBS Song Festival (held on Jan 23, 2016). It's a dream come true for the young artist to be able to collaborate with his sunbaenim/idol for such a beautiful and meaningful song on stage.\nYB - A Flying Butterfly stage by 20-year-old idols participated by Jungkook with his fellow K-artists of the same line in the industry (during 2016 KBS Song Festival). What I love on this stage? Well, BTS Maknae slays!

But the Ttukseom and Gwangnaru certification centers are interchangeable.\nYeouido Certification Center isn\u2019t. You\u2019ll need to cross.

Not enough to own a bike at home but enough to hire one or join a tour on most of my trips. When planning my trip to South Korea, I decided that I wanted to give cycling in Seoul a try. I thought it would be a great way to get my bearings and explore the city. So as soon as I dropped my bags at the hostel, I headed out for my first adventure. I decided to follow my guidebook\u2019s advice and hire a bike to head on a self-guided tour of Yeouido and the Hangang River area.\nI jumped on the subway and made my way to Yeouido \u2013 a huge island that\u2019s home to Seoul\u2019s main financial district. Some of the city\u2019s (and even South Korea\u2019s) tallest skyscrapers are located on Yeouido but I wasn\u2019t here for the buildings. I headed towards the river and the Yeouido Hangang Park \u2013 a sprawling green space along the banks of the Hangang River.\nI found the small bike rental hut after a few minutes strolling the park\u2019s clean paths. There was a price list in Korean and English and I decided that two hours would be enough for me to complete the 15km route I planned to do. 5000 won (\u00a33.50/$4.70) would get me a \u201csingle\u201d classic bike while splashing out 10000 won (\u00a36.70/$9.40) would land me an \u201cadvanced\u201d bike which I soon figured out was a hybrid bike. I decided I was advanced enough to go for the latter.\nAfter handing over my passport as a deposit (you can use any photo ID), I was handed my shiny bike and I was on my way! It was sunny and warm \u2013 I avoided the worst of the midday heat \u2013 as I set off to explore.\nI cycled west through Hangang Park past strolling couples, friends relaxing in inflatable donuts and kids splashing around in the stream. I stopped to check out a sculpture of a monster from a famous Korean movie \u201cThe Host\u201d that visitors are encouraged to climb. The nearby \u201cI SEOUL U\u201d sign \u2013 the capital\u2019s official slogan \u2013 offered great views of the city skyline across the river. The park seemed like a great place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. UPDATE: The I SEOUL U sign location has changed a number of times since March 2018. Let me know if you spot it somewhere different in the city!\nI headed out of the park and up the ramp onto the busy Mapo Bridge. I cycled across and took the ramp down to the North bank of the Han River. There were a lot more cyclists on this side and a dedicated cycle lane that went along the river. Biking in Seoul appeared to be just as popular as it is in London!\nI was surprised to notice an outdoor gym just a little further. As it turned out, Koreans love to keep active and this became a common sight throughout my visit! I couldn\u2019t resist a mini workout and did a few sets of the bench press! I also got talking to some locals who came up to me and asked me questions about where I am from and what I was doing Korea. I\u2019ve only been in the country a few hours and was already experiencing its incredible hospitality!\nI continued my riverside bike ride, passing a gym every couple of minutes. If I stopped at every single one, I\u2019d be packing some serious muscle by the end of the ride! There were also locals playing something resembling bowls and croquet but I couldn\u2019t really figure out what they were doing! The views on this side of the river weren\u2019t as good, as the path traced a busy carriageway but once in a while I caught a glimpse of Yeouido and its skyscrapers and greenery on the other side.\nAfter a few kilometres I reached a cliff with a building adorned by a cross. This was the Jeoldusan Martyrs Shrine, where in 1866 up to 2000 Korean Catholics were executed and thrown into the Han River. Jeoldusan means \u201cBeheading Hill\u201d in Korean \u2013 I am glad I wasn\u2019t visiting during the night as I can imagine it would be quite creepy.\nIt was time to cross the river back to the south side and after carrying the bike up the steps to Yanghwa Bridge, I cycled past the entrance to Seonyudo Park which occupies an island in the middle of the river. I didn\u2019t have time to explore it but I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s a great place to wander around or enjoy a drink at the caf\u00e9.\nOnce on the other side, I stopped to check another outdoor gym right under the bridge. Among the fitness equipment, pillars supporting the bridge each sported colourful music and film themed murals. I thought it was a really cool way to utilise what would otherwise be a drab space that you wouldn\u2019t give a second glance.\nI rode on down the tree-lined lane and soon made it back to the western tip of Yeouido. There was a fork in the road. Before continuing along the route, I took a detour to check out the Seoul Marina and the National Assembly building (heading down the right path in the photo). Back at the fork, I turned left and headed under the bridge you can see on the left side of the photo.\nThe route heads down the quieter southern part of Yeoudo island along the greenery of Yeouido Saetgang Ecological Park. It\u2019s the first eco park of its kind in Korea and was designed to preserve the ecosystem of the area and educate visitors about flora and fauna in the area. I stopped a few times to wander along the boardwalks that take you closer to nature. I really enjoyed the peace and quiet of the area, even with the towering skyscrapers visible in the background.\nAfter the relaxing stretch through the Eco Park, I reached the eastern end of Yeouido and started heading back towards Hangang Park and the start of my ride. This part of the island is notable for 63 SQUARE, a towering skyscraper and one of Korea\u2019s tallest and most recognised buildings. There is an observatory deck offering impressive views of Seoul, restaurants and even an aquarium!\nI was soon back in Hangang Park, cycling past ice cream stalls and restaurants set just offshore on a pier. Visitors could also hire swan boats to explore the river.\nI managed to cover 15 km in my two allotted hours and still had a few minutes spare when I handed my bike over. I stretched my legs with a stroll through the park, enjoying the late afternoon sun and multiple iced coffees I bought to rehydrate! As first days go in a foreign country, this was a pretty good one!\nIf you liked this post, check out my other blogs on South Korea!\nWhere: Yeouido, Seoul, South Korea.\nGetting There: Subway Line 5 to Yeouinaru, take exit 3 and follow signs to Hangang Cruise Terminal in Yeouido Hangang Park.\nThis entry was posted in South Korea and tagged bike, bike rental, cycling, Han River, riding, seoul, south korea, Yeouido.\nIt\u2019s awesome exploring a new city on a bicycle!

I\u2019ve only done a bike tour is Barcelona and that was hectic! Hills and traffic don\u2019t mix well when you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going! Thanks for linking up with #TheWeeklyPostcard!\nAh I can understand when it\u2019s busy and you are riding in built up areas but this was pretty relaxing and I never felt intimidated by other cyclists and there were no roads to cross! Hopefully you will get a chance to rent a bike someday soon!\nWe walked the parks along the Han River when we were there in May \u2013 but we saw lots of"

They now tie G-Dragon, BoA, and T-ara for second-most top 10's; only 2NE1, with 12, have more.\nZion.T only continues to grow with each release. Determined to go up the latter one rung at a time, his latest single \"Yanghwa Bridge\" enters at #8, following the #9 \"Miss Kim\" and the #10 \"Babay\" from last year.

It is the group's 3rd Platinum single, putting them in select company with 2NE1, After School and CRAYON POP as the only acts with 3 or more Platinum hits. It is the 31st Platinum single on our chart. 2NE1 finally crosses platinum with \"Happy\" after 20 weeks.

Post in the comment!<|endoftext|>In this clinical psychology episode of The Psychology World Podcast, you\u2019ll hear about Why Not to Say to Someone with Anxiety. This is a great and very useful podcast episode. Please enjoy!\nThis psychology podcast episode has been sponsored by Formulation in Psychotherapy. Available on all major eBook retailers and direct from me. And you can get the paperback and hardback copy from Amazon or your local bookstore and libraries!\nIt\u2019s perfectly natural for us to say this to someone when we see them stressed out. Because we want them to relax and calm down. We don\u2019t want to see our friends and family in distress.\nAnd in people without anxiety saying these things can be okay. But this doesn\u2019t help as we probably know from personal experience.\nFor example, the other night, I was in distress over my exams and I was told just to calm down. This wasn\u2019t helpful and this wasn\u2019t going to solve my problem.\nTherefore, whilst I don\u2019t have anxiety. Saying this to me just wasn\u2019t helpful.\nAnd telling a person who suffers with anxiety to calm down is even worse for two reasons.\n Or you don\u2019t care enough about the person to sit down with them and talk about their concerns.\nSecondly, this is a pointless phrase. Since when people are anxious find it very hard to relax because their sympathetic nervous system is activated, and they are experiencing the fight or flight response. And this is designed to override reasoning. Meaning, trying to reason with them is pointless.\nInstead, you should ask open-ended questions about how they\u2019re feeling. As this shows you care about the person and you\u2019ll start to understand why they\u2019re feeling the way they do.\nSkip these next two paragraphs if we\u2019re sensitive to certain topics.\nAnother example, very quick, is self-harming behaviour. Instead of allowing or avoiding the person who\u2019s doing it. Try and be helpful and help them find another way to cope with it.\nThen another example is it\u2019s normal to want to protect your loved ones from the thing that scares them. For instance, if your brother is scared of people. But your mother makes sure he avoids other people. Then this seems logical and protective. Yet over time, this is harming him.\nSince anxiety feeds off avoidance. And for lack of a better term, the longer this brother avoids people, the worse his anxiety will get.\n Then you start to form an association between the thing and danger.\nInstead, it\u2019s important to gently and firmly hold them to account. You do this by supporting them and slowly introducing them to the stimuli or thing that makes them anxious.\nAnd things similar to that.\nThis point is just comical, and I have spoken about this months ago on the psychology podcast.\nSo, I know this is perfectly logical because we do all have our own problems and issues. And you might want to remind them of that fact to comfort them.\nHowever, when you say this to an anxious person or anyone.  \nInstead, you sit down and listen to their difficulties and see what they have to say.\nI really hoped you enjoyed this clinical psychology episode.<|endoftext|>You are choosing ignore the plain reading of the text. I noticed you did not address the phrase \u201cthe Word was God.\u201d The text directly states the \u201cWord/word\u201d (however you want to capitalize it) WAS God and then became flesh. You cannot escape that. \n\nLater in John 8 and John 10, Jesus Himself says He was God, and the Jews clearly understood what He said because they were ready to stone Him for it. Paul in Philippians 2, says Jesus is equal to God. The clear teaching of scripture is that Jesus is God.<|endoftext|>Click HERE to be notified when a BMW 340xi is added to the database by email or subscribe to our RSS feed Webmasters, click HERE for code to display the feed on your site!\nThis page contains details on a 2016 BMW 340xi.

Jubilation!\nWhile the world of finance tears its hair out and, at the same time, is probably colluding to somehow punish \u201cthe people\u201d who had the courage to finally say Enough!, Brussels is gathering its \u201cGood little Eichmanns\u201d (h/t to Ward Churchill), otherwise known as its commissioners and heads of state, to come up with some plan to thwart a mass exodus from the cultural and financial prison they so painstakingly erected.\nWhile the MSM is painting this as a takeover by the extreme Right, it is, in my opinion, nothing of the sort. Strange as it may seem, this is what happens when people put aside labels and identities inflicted upon them by the politically correct of whatever so-called persuasion (they all work for the same bosses, anyway). I think someone once called it \u201ccommon sense\u201d.\nThe organization of any state is complicated enough, but there is, at the least, and on principle, a link between the governed and the governors. It may not be apparent in the US, whose elite and its political water boys seem to live in another sphere altogether, and this is why the US worked so hard to promote the creation of the EU, the United States of Europe. The US couldn\u2019t stand the idea of all those little European countries, with their own cultures and languages and aspirations, undertaking individual social experiments, flirting with communism or socialism in their own idiosyncratic and creative ways. Can\u2019t have that, can we?\nNo! Much better to emasculate, devaginalize. To reduce that espresso-drinking, caf\u00e9-sitting, long vacation-taking, boring movie-making collection of proud regional characters to the brain-dead, knuckle-dragging homogeneity of its own genocidal state. Reduce national autonomy to the level of a circus-trained lion (see Circus Politicus, Michel Albin, 2012) under the private big top in Brussels.\nAfter forty some years, the Brits have decided differently. Having thrown off the chains of the Brussels mafia, the question remains as to whether they will finally break free of DC\u2019s neo-liberal, neo-con agenda. Greece tried to do that, voting for Tsipras Inc, who promptly caved to The Troika, essentially giving his own people the finger.\nWill this provoke, finally, a rush for the exits? I, for one, surely hope so.<|endoftext|>Malcolm Gladwells book, Outliers, sheds light on why this could happen.  Airline safety has come a long way since"

It's a really touching song that's directed to the members. It's about them moving to a different dorm but in Suga, J-Hope, and Rap Mon's raps there's a personal story of how they were before they debuted and their struggles. Even though it's a song that seems like a letter to the members, it's really relatable especially if you're facing major changes in your life. It's such a beautiful song and it's really special, knowing what the lyrics mean just makes it more beautiful. \n\nAnd of course, Zion. T's Yanghwa Bridge is incredibly beautiful if you understand the lyrics. It's about his life but we can relate in a way of not wanting to grow up n<|endoftext|>fileFormatVersion: 2\nguid: 0fc1c97faad5a2e42b8b9f5e40e9ee80\nNativeFormatImporter:\n  externalObjects: {}\n  mainObjectFileID: 11400000\n  userData: \n  assetBundleName: \n  assetBundleVariant:<|endoftext|>Hey where else to vent but here?\n\nI didn't get the difficulty spike in the first game because for a hot minute I wanted to fill out my mantra grid, so I stalked Titanias for several hours. I didn't ever actually fill it out because I got bored, but by the time I was done, I was stupidly powerful, so I took on all superbosses except for any bullshit bosses that are locked behind new game plus for some dumb reason, and kinda flew through all of it.\n\nBut I totally hear you on the encounter rate. It could definitely be turned down a notch. Particularly if you're bee-lining for something useful.\n\nI haven't gotten far in the second game yet, so I can't speak to any of those specific issues, but it sounds like I won't enjoy my Serph being taken away from me. D=\n\nI'm all about the gameplay and atmosphere though. It's the closest I can get to Nocturne without actually playing Nocturne all over again.<|endoftext|>fileFormatVersion: 2\nguid: 24d164df11a7180448c14bfcc1a5bd2d\nNativeFormatImporter:\n  externalObjects: {}\n  mainObjectFileID: |||PHONE_NUMBER||| 179872738\n  userData: \n  assetBundleName: \n  assetBundleVariant:<|endoftext|>You remember a lot more than I do. I was pretty young in those early series. My memories of Stockton and Malone don't include any flopping. However, they definitely had a reputation for dirty play and throwing elbows. Perhaps I accept it by saying it was a different era where the game was much more physical, but I agree that playing the game in a dirty way reduces the respect players deserve. \n\nRE: Harden's style. I think it is something that people will always love if he plays for their team and hate if he plays against. Obviously, he is extremely skilled and his stepback and finishing are special. I just hate it when anyone makes unnatural plays like the swing through or pulling up for a jumper halfway through a screen because they know they'll get fouled. It is a smart play and they're using the rules to their advantage, but from an entertainment perspective, it's not fun. Luckily, y'all have Tucker and Capela to bring some smiles while suffering through Harden :P<|endoftext|>fileFormatVersion: 2\nguid: d21e2d7a9cd43624e82dfe0f3a1d09fd\nNativeFormatImporter:\n  externalObjects: {}\n  mainObjectFileID: 0\n  userData: \n  assetBundleName: \n  assetBundleVariant:<|endoftext|>First of all, **Thank you** so much for this reply.I really appreciate the time and effort you put in for justification. \n\nFor *spam*, I completely agree. My point of view was completely short sighted and I 100% see how OP's post could have been spam. He never even said anything this whole time either. It was a weak attempt at discussion, I guess it was pure coincidence that some guy in Canada had tried that specific brand before. \n\nAs for *repetition*, I would love to actually help out with the so called *List*. I'm in the \"professional\" scene so I feel I could offer some help; although the vast majority here **really** know what they're doing. I usually only take interest in equipment to fantasize about me potentially owning and not in the \"help me brew a cup of coffee plz\" threads.  \n\nFor *fluff*, I haven't been around long enough to know about that battleground. I whole-heartily trust you and the rest of the mod teams judgement on that. Places like /r/cafe and /r/roasting are great for the fluff, they keep their niche while still acting quite mature for fluff based subreddits. I should have looked around on this subreddit for the fluff subs. I usually browse via mobile so I didn't see the huge sidebar. For content, I guess that's something I could actually try to help with. /r/cafe is something very easy for me to post in, that subreddit needs to help to keep it living. \n\nI really enjoy this community, and I really want to be a true member of it. It feels oddly empty to me though, it's lacking some personality to me. The rest of reddit sees /r/coffee as \"pretentious\" but really, everyone here is *extremely* passionate. \n\nThank you /u/Anomander, I really appreciate the reply and the effort you put into this subreddit.<|endoftext|>fileFormatVersion: 2\nguid: 5b88bbe8849786247b2ec5b8da43a261\nNativeFormatImporter:\n  externalObjects: {}\n  mainObjectFileID: 0\n  userData: \n  assetBundleName: \n  assetBundleVariant:<|endoftext|>&gt;A common theme during election cycles is the idea that people who do not vote for one of the major party candidates are wasting their vote. This idea is passed around so frequently and casually that it is likely that many of the people proposing it never really stopped to think about it. Unfortunately, those accused of wasting their vote often mount a meek defense, acknowledging that they may indeed be wasting their vote, but it\u2019s okay because they\u2019re voting their conscience. Aside from the condescension inherent in telling another their vote is wasted, this logic lacks a basic understanding of what voting means. Voting is more than a simple act of math; voting is people actively taking responsibility for choosing their leaders and representatives. Therefore, you do not vote for who you think will win, you vote for who you think should win. The reality is the \u201cwasted\u201d vote has value, it wields power; it is intrinsically the same as the vote cast for the winner.<|endoftext|>{\n  \"ver\": \"1.0.5\",\n  \"uuid\": \"133c50a3-ee7a-4f7d-809b-65a57ecc179b\",\n  \"isPlugin\": false,\n  \"loadPluginInWeb\": true,\n  \"loadPluginInNative\": true,\n  \"loadPluginInEditor\": false,\n  \"subMetas\": {}\n}<|endoftext|>I never got angry, I would just shut down emotionally.  Even at 40 years old I would act like a surly teenager not saying much of anything anytime I had to interact with her.  \n\nI had finally made the decision to cut her out of my life entirely right before she went and died.  At the time all I felt was immense relief, but now I'm a little annoyed that she even took that closure of telling her off away from me.  Bah.\n\nEDIT: Although I guess it's never too late to cut someone out of your life.  I think perhaps I'll stop talking about her from now on.

The meeting was called with less than 24 hours notice, and I work as a nanny and could not realistically request a day off with such little notice. I accept this as my downfall, and simply requested an accommodation to try and work it out. Additionally, as a district that has called to go fully remote, I did not feel 100% comfortable attending a meeting in person. Again, I know this is a personal downfall. I appreciate your response and hope others feel more comfortable than I when it comes to stepping up to the plate.<|endoftext|>fileFormatVersion: 2\nguid: ce16b8dac18665d4c8cd8ab02a71fcd9\nfolderAsset: yes\nDefaultImporter:\n  externalObjects: {}\n  userData: \n"
