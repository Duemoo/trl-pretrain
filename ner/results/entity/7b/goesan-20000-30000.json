Simply right-click the highest parent folder and choose to synchronize. Lightroom will sync all the existing folders within that folder.\nThe goal of managing your photo library is to delete the bad photos and highlight your good ones, and you can start by using nags. Whenever you see a photo you like, press P to mark the photo as a pick, to mark the photo as a reject, hit the key X. A little message appears each time to tell you what you\u2019ve marked, and a little flag icon appears on the bottom left of that photo to indicate That it\u2019s been flagged \u2013 a white flag denotes a pick, a black flag denotes a reject. If you make a mistake, simply press u to un-flag it.\nThe great thing about using flags is that you can always view your picks easily by using the Attribute filter in the Library\u2019s central panel. Simply click on the white flag and all the photos you\u2019ve flagged as picks will appear.

Get the lowdown on next week's Walford drama.\nJanine (Charlie Brooks) has been trying to patch things up with her daughter Scarlett as she is being investigated by social services.\nHowever, the nine-year-old played by Tabitha Byron has been less than eager to have a relationship with her mother.\nUnbeknownst to her, Janine gets help from Mick (Danny Dyer) as he tells her she needs to prove she is a good mother.\nFollowing another one of Scarlett's rejections, Mick takes matters into his own hands to help the pair kiss and make up.\nMick gives Scarlett a special present, pretending it was all Janine's idea.\nBut while the gesture was certainly made out of kindness, Mick is unaware that stone-cold Janine is slowly but surely warming up to him.\nTwelve-year-old Bailey (Kara-Leah Fernandes) hatches a plan to push Karen (Lorraine Stanley) and Mitch (Roger Griffiths) back into each other's arms when she hears them argue over their sleeping situation.\nAnd while Karen complains to the young girl about a leak in the roof (which has led to the former couple sharing the same bed), Mitch gets a surprise delivery.\nWhen Karen receives her own parcel, Bailey is delighted to see everything is going according to her plan.\nShe even believes she can get away with it when she sees that Karen is none the wiser.\nHowever, Bailey's half-brother Keegan (Zack Morris) and Mitch soon clock on.\nA sympathetic Mitch has a chat with his daughter and tells he can't make him and Karen fall in love again.\n\nSoon after, Bailey and Mitch overhear her talk about the driver but get their hopes when they believe she is talking about her former partner.\nWill they realise their mistake?\nAfter his son Aaron's arrest, Harvey (Ross Boatman) decides to give himself and Dana (Barbara Smith) a fresh start by moving out of Albert Square.\nHe explains to Jack Branning (played by Scott Maslen) that he and his daughter need to leave and lies about his mother being ill.\n\nAccording to him, Jack could kick them out if he finds out about their link with Aaron.\nBut while Harvey is set to pack up and leave, Dana doesn't want to tag along.\nIs she hopeful to rekindle things with Bobby?\n\nBelieving she hung up on the phone, she subsequently reveals a huge secret while talking to Mila and Kioni\u2026 with Peter listening in.\nFaced with the possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison, it's no wonder why Phil (Steve McFadden) is so stressed.\nThe villain loses his cool when Kat (Jessie Wallace) puts his phone on silent so they can have some alone time.\nWhen he sees that he has missed multiple calls, Phil blames Kat and lashes out at her, only to apologise several moments later.\nKnowing he could never accept being an informant for the police, and to spare Kat from heartbreak, Phil makes a tough decision.\nAfter apologising to her for his behaviour, he puts an end to their relationship.\nKat is understandably distraught by this abrupt breakup.\nBut when Sharon (Letitia Dean) learns that Phil ended things with her, she knows the Walford baddie is hiding something.\nLying the pressure on him, Sharon eventually gets him to admit that he hasn't said anything to Kat about his potential life sentence.\nShe gives him a chance to come clean, adding that if he decided not to, she would be telling Kat everything herself.\nWhat will Phil do?\nRainie (Tanya Franks) and Stuart (Ricky Champ) for a united front against the latter's cancer.\nAnd after initially pushing her away from her upon finding out he was ill, Stuart lets Rainie in, letting her assist him during every step of his battle.\nDuring an emergency appointment scheduled by Rainie, the doctor explains the surgery Stuart will be undergoing and makes it clear that the operation should be planned as soon as possible.\nBut when the doctor mentions pain medication, Stuart immediately panics and tells Mick he feels he is being punished for his past.\nWhat is Stuart hiding?\nGray's (Toby-Alexander Smith) grasp on Chelsea is getting tighter.\nAlthough she was prescribed anti-depressants by her GP, Chelsea (Zaraah Abrahams) refuses to take the medication in order to breast feed her son Jordan.\nKheerat (Jaz Deol) gives her the chance to unwind at the salon, knowing she has been feeling defeated, while he distracts Gray by giving a lift to the hospital.\nBut when Chelsea relaxes with a sip of champagne, she gets an urgent call from Gray: Jordan has stopped breathing.\nWhile with Gray, Kheerat tries to get him to confess to Chantelle's murder but is interrupted by a doctor who urges the young father to make a decision.\nThe doctor announces that they can give Jordan a tracheotomy.\nGray agrees but becomes livid when Chelsea meets up with him and Keerat and he smells alcohol on her.\nWhen Kheerat steps in, adding that he paid for Chelsea's session, Gray is fuming and accuses him of being obsessed with his wives.\nLater on, Whitney (Shona McGarty) tries to talk to Chelsea but the latter is firmly under Gray's thumb.\nChelsea tells Whitney she no longer wants anything to do with her or Kheerat, putting an end to their plan to expose Gray.\nHas Chelsea really given up?<|endoftext|>Filming has officially begun on Jun Ji Hyun and Lee Min Ho\u2019s comeback drama!\nThe two Hallyu stars are playing the leads in SBS\u2019s \u201cLegend of the Blue

The famous \u201cChief Seattle\u201d speech that contains the lines above was made up for a Southern Baptist film project about pollution in 1971 (thanks to Russell Moore for the trivia tip). The writer, a professor of film named Ted Perry, was under contract to do the script, and he imagined what Chief Seattle might have to say about the environmental problems of the day. The words are moving\u2013so moving that people soon forgot they were invented, and they took on a life of their own.\nConservation writer and activist Andy Kerr has what looks like a fairly complete history of the origins of the speech Chief Seattle never actually made. Snopes.com has a standard copy of the Chief Seattle address.\nAccording to another account of the speech\u2019s origins, Perry\u2019s version was edited to make it more Christian. The version most folks see does contain a fair amount of religious language. It\u2019s more feel-good, pop theology than anything derived from Christian (or Jewish) scriptures (this was done in an era before theological conservatives began to ramp up the quality of Southern Baptist theological reflection). But you see the language cropping up often in environmental writing, and even in scholarly work. Al Gore apparently quoted the fake speech in his book Earth in the Balance. You can even find a Chief Seattle quote on the website of the Environmental Protection Agency.\nSo which is more shocking\u2013(1) that so many people love and adore a fake speech, (2) that in the 1970s Southern Baptists were producing films about pollution, or (3) that environmentalists so often quote a Southern Baptist document?\nYou can see an example of current Southern Baptist engagement with environmental theology by watching pastor and former SBC president James Merritt preach on the \u201cTheology of Ecology\u201d. Merritt would never have countenanced the dodgy theology of the Chief Seattle speech. He puts Christian environmental thought on a stronger Scriptural footing.\nThe real Chief Seattle was actually a Catholic, and he did give a speech, but the records are very poor on what he said. The much-published 1971 version has been revealed to be fake repeatedly, starting back in the 1990s, in publications such as Omni, Newsweek, and the New York Times (which published a front-page article on the myth of the Chief Seattle speech).<|endoftext|>Detects human PLG, human Plasmin, and the catalytic domain in direct ELISAs and Western blots.\nMeasured by its ability to neutralize Human Plasminogen (1 \u00b5g/mL, Catalog # 1939-SE) cleavage of the fluorogenic peptide substrate Suc-AFK-Amc (100 \u00b5M). The Neutralization Dose (ND50) is typically 1 \u00b5g/mL.\nNeutralization of Plasminogen Activity by Human Plasminogen Antibody. The cleavage of Suc-AFK-AMC (100 \u00b5M) by Human Plasminogen (1 \u00b5g/mL, Catalog # 1939-SE) is measured after preincubation with increasing concentrations of Mouse Anti-Human Plasminogen Monoclonal Antibody (Catalog # MAB1939). The ND50 is typically 1 \u00b5g/mL.\nPlasminogen (PLG) is the precursor of plasmin, an active serine protease that dissolves the fibrin of blood clots and acts in many other processes such as embryonic development, tissue remodeling, inflammation, and tumor invasion (1, 2). Synthesized in the kidney, PLG is found in plasma and many extracellular fluids. Activated by u- or t-plasminogen activator, the single-chain PLG (amino acid residues 20-810) is converted to plasmin, which consists of disulfide bond-linked heavy chain A (residues 20-580) and light chain B (residues 581-810). Heavy chain A contains 5 kringle domains and light chain B corresponds to the serine protease domain. A fragment consisting of the first 4 kringle domains has been named as angiostatin, a novel angiogenesis inhibitor (3, 4).\nPetersen, T.E. et al. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265:6104.\nForsgren, M. et al.

However, TMZ has short half\u2011life and frequently induces tumor resistance, which can limit its therapeutic efficiency. In the present study, it was hypothesized that combined treatment with TMZ and acteoside has synergistic effects in glioblastoma therapy. Using cell viability and wound\u2011healing assays, it was determined that this treatment regimen reduced cell viability and migration to a greater extent than either TMZ or acteoside alone. Following previous reports that TMZ affected autophagy in glioma cells, the present study examined the effects of TMZ + acteoside combination treatment on apoptosis and autophagy. The TMZ + acteoside combination treatment increased the cleavage of caspase\u20113 and levels of B\u2011cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl\u20112)\u2011associated X protein and phosphorylated p53, and decreased the level of Bcl\u20112. The combination treatment increased microtubule\u2011associated protein 1 light chain 3 and apoptosis\u2011related gene expression. It was also determined that TMZ + acteoside induced apoptosis and autophagy through the mitogen\u2011activated protein kinase signaling pathway. These findings suggest that acteoside has beneficial effects on TMZ\u2011based glioblastoma therapy.\nGlioblastoma is the most common type of malignant primary brain tumor and the most invasive and devastating primary brain tumor (1,2), with a median survival rate of ~18 months with aggressive multimodality therapy. Current treatment decisions are limited and include radiation, chemotherapy and surgery in combination with the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) (3,4). Despite the availability of aggressive therapies, patients with glioblastoma generally have a poor prognosis (5). TMZ is the major chemotherapeutic drug used in the clinical treatment of malignant glioblastoma (6-8); as an alkylating agent in the imidazotetrazine series, it is able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (9-11). During malignant glioblastoma progression and extensive invasion throughout the brain, steadily increasing drug resistance to TMZ decreases its therapeutic efficacy (12,13). Accordingly, novel therapeutic drugs to counter glioblastoma are urgently sought.\nPrevious studies have reported that glioma cells undergo cell death via autophagy, or type II programmed cell death, in response to TMZ (14,15). Autophagy can be inhibited by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) through the conversion of micro-tubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-I to LC3-II, thus reducing glioblastoma cell death (16,17); however, the role of autophagy is dependent on the cellular context. With the exception of a cytotoxic role during TMZ action, the induction of autophagy by cellular stress is a cytoprotective process that eliminates stress-induced cytoplasmic aggregates, organelles and macromolecules in mammalian cells through the lysosomal system. In turn, cells involved in maintaining homeostasis receive energy through these catabolic processes (18,19). The complex roles of autophagy suggest that an autophagy activator may have anticancer effects in combination with TMZ treatment by inducing glioblastoma cell autophagy without exerting deleterious effects or providing benefits to normal tissues. Of note, TMZ has exhibited synergistic therapeutic effects in combination with vitamin D, including suppressed cell viability and enhanced autophagy in glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, the combination of TMZ and vitamin D has been shown to exert anticancer effects in vivo, including reduced tumor size and prolonged survival rate. These studies suggest that combination treatment may have synergistic anticancer effects via autophagic mechanisms in TMZ-based glioblastoma therapy (15).\nActeoside is a phenylethanoid glycoside that is widely distributed in several tonified traditional Chinese herbal medicines (20,21). A number of pharmacological actions, including antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antinephritic and antimetastatic actions, have been associated with acteoside (22-24). Previous studies have demonstrated that acteoside has protective effects against carbon tetrachloride- and D-galactosamine-induced liver injury. The mechanisms underlying the protective effects of acteoside are likely related to its capacity to inhibit P450-mediated bioactivation and free radical scavenging effects induced by carbon tetrachloride exposure (25,26).\nTherefore, evidence suggests that both acteoside and TMZ induce anticancer effects through cell death. However, their association and anticancer effects in the context of glioblastoma remain to be elucidated. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to verify the synergistic anticancer effects of acteoside combined with TMZ in glioblastoma therapy. A cell viability assay was performed to analyze the anticancer effects of the combination treatment in C6 glioblastoma cells (a rat glioblastoma cell line), and the results were compared with those following treatment with TMZ alone. To further examine the mechanism of cell death caused by cotreatment with acteoside and TMZ, apoptosis- and autophagy-related genes in C6 cells were examined.\nThe C6 rat glioblastoma cell line was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA). The cells were cultured under sterile conditions at 37\u00b0C in a humid environment with 5% of CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1% antibiotics and antimycotics (all Welgene, Daegu, Korea).\nAbeliophyllum distichum Nakai [voucher no. Park1001(ANH)] was collected in Misunhyang Theme park, Seongbul-Mountain Recreation Forest, 78, Chungmin-rogigok-gil, Goesan-eup, Goesan-gun, Chungcheongbuk-do, Korea.\nTo induce callus formation (27), 1-cm2 leaf explants were isolated from the fresh plants. The explant was cultured on Murachige and Skoog medium (4% sucrose, 0.9% agar supplemented with 1 mg/l naphthalene acetic acid and 1 mg/l 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, pH 5.7) at 25\u00b0C. The callus was induced 20 days later. A sufficient quantity of acteoside was obtained through subculture to separate and purify acteoside from the callus (Fig. 1). Different batches of purified acteoside were used in each experiment. Each experiment was performed three times using a different batch.\nThe ethylacetate fractions were concentrated in vacuo and used as a sample for the purification of acteoside. Acteoside was isolated and purified by the Accelerated Chromatographic Isolation system (Isolera\u2122 Spektra, Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden) using SNAP KPHOSPHO-SIL and SNAP Ultra Cartridges (Biotage). The acteoside purified from the callus was quantitatively analyzed using the standard acteoside by HPLC-PDA analysis. Finally, acteoside of \u226595% purity was obtained from the callus and used as a sample for chemotherapy of temozolomide-based glioblastoma.\nTo identify the TMZ half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 value) against C6 cells, 1\u00d7104 cells in single cell suspensions were seeded into individual wells of 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C prior to TMZ treatment at the indicated concentrations (1, 5, 10, and 20 mM) at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. Following determination of the TMZ IC50 value as 5 mM, the cells were treated for 24 h with 5 mM TMZ, 50 \u00b5M acteoside, or a combination of the two (5 mM TMZ"

So, I don't know what kind of support you have to help you with the children. If you're a single mom and you have young children, often you can feel like you work just to pay for daycare. If this is your case then you can often start resenting your job for taking you away from your children and leaving you with very little money to show for all your efforts. If these are your realities, then once again focus on changing your perspective about your work and start getting motivated to change your work situation with some support.\nIf you have great allies, or at the very least trustworthy and dependable people that can help you from time to time, reach out and treat yourself to some \u201cme-time\u201d or time with your friends. Look at taking time for you as a gift to your children. If mommy gets her needs met then she will be an even better, more fulfilled, happy mommy...ready to take on that great next adventure with ease and an energized presence. If you don\u2019t take time out for you, you may be depriving your children of getting the \u201cbest you\u201d that they can have.\nWhen you don't get your needs met you tend to be distracted with unfinished nagging tasks or by your thoughts and wishes to get what you want or need. These distractions keep you from being fully present with your children, at work or with someone else.\n Take time to look at all you are; see all your great qualities. Recognize all that you have accomplished. If you have a hard time with this, then reach out and I'll help you spell it out clearly.\nIf you do have a significant other, then the fact that you didn't even mention them says to me that you're not getting all the support you need and your relationship could need some TLC, too. Find a way to communicate your feelings, your wants and needs to them, so they can help you.\nOften our partners are clueless to what we really need, until we tell them. Most of the time, we are even in the dark about it, too. This is another reason to get clarity. If you have a partner and they're not supportive of you or your needs; if they are not one that you can easily communicate with, then they\u2019re not getting what they really need either. If they were, they would be more supportive, happier and more attentive to you. If this is something you can relate to, then know you're not alone. Very few people are taught how to take care of their own needs or how to communicate effectively. The great thing is\u2026it\u2019s never too late to learn! Just as it is never too late to learn how to use A Mom's Guilt, to empower you.\nFrom what you've written, it sounds to me like you're lacking some security in your life. Perhaps you need to feel more important, beyond being Mom. Figure out what's really missing and then devise a plan to go after what you want more of in your life.

The survey was conducted by an Ad Hoc Committee on Graduate Programs released in early February, Davidson said via email.\nThe proposal will be reviewed soon by the faculty Committee on Academic Planning (CAP) and the Graduate Council Committee (GCC), which work together to evaluate all of the College\u2019s graduate programs.\nThe decision will ultimately be made by President Vickers and other members of the administration.

Several years ago, the Board of Trustees created a \u201cfinancial equilibrium\u201d plan for the College. Part of this plan includes keeping the number of tenured faculty constant: so, whenever a tenure-track position in one department is created, such a position in another department must be eliminated. According to Pahomov, the Computer Science department, which gained the new tenure-track position, \u201cdesperately needed another appointed faculty member.\u201d There are other \u201coversubscribed\u201d departments as well, he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re a small college, probably with more programs than anyplace else our size,\u201d Pahomov said, adding that the number of good programs at Bryn Mawr necessitates the \u201cfinancial equilibrium\u201d concept in order to keep all the departments equally staffed.\nEndowment for the Humanities to come to Bryn Mawr to study the Russian program.

There aren't any big surprises or huge moments, no sad tears or heartbreak... just a sweet, predictable romance, witty dialogue, hot sex and a genuinely likeable couple.\nSamanthe Beck's debut novel is perfect for a fun, steamy read!\n4.5 shining bright stars!\nGood Gravy Beans, I loved this one. I laughed and giggled - yes giggled - throughout.\nAs others have said, this has been done before, but who cares when it is redone as well as this?\n# A wonderfully liberating natural and outspoken heroine, Ellie. The small city homecoming doctor.\n# A former bad-boy hero, the village's sexiest man Tyler, who is still running a MC and is visible at the local pub.\n\u201cPromise to teach me...\nSometimes you just get the perfect book at the perfect time after a whole pile of not-so"

        "passage": " for me, and I like sports conspiracy theories. I can\u2019t see Yzerman going for a move that would likely be subject to a grievance if there was any chance of it being perceived as less than legal.\nThat said\u2026 I want the Wings to take bad cap dollars on to gain other assets but Johnson\u2019s deal is really bad. Four more seasons at $5 million per year for a guy whose numbers dropped off dramatically during the Bolts\u2019 Cup run. That side deal would have to be extremely impressive to make that move.\nAs free agency moves on, the Red Wings still need a goalie, probably at least one defenseman, and maybe some forwards. I\u2019d hold off and save some of those roster slots for potential salary dump deals but that\u2019s just me.\nIn goal, Thomas Greiss is still on the board, and he\u2019d probably be my top choice. As I write this, Corey Crawford signed with New Jersey for less than $2 million per season, which seems to be a sign that goalie contract numbers are getting back to sane after Markstrom\u2019s ridiculous deal.\nI wonder about Tyson Barrie on defense. Coming off a relatively bad season in Toronto, a \u201cshow me\u201d deal could work. I still think I\u2019d prefer a trade candidate, though.\nThe Detroit Red Wings announced the signings of forwards Kyle Criscuolo and Riley Barber and goalie Kevin Boyle on Friday.\nAll three are likely AHL-bound, assuming there actually is an AHL campaign in the coming season.\nCriscuolo should be a familiar name to Griffins fans, having played 80 games with the team during the 2015-16 and 2016-17 seasons, winning the Calder Cup with Grand Rapids the second year.\nBoyle is a little bit of a surprise as Detroit already has Cal Pickard, Kaden Fulcher, and Filip Larsson under contract for next season. Given Larsson\u2019s struggles at the AHL level, though, an insurance policy does make sense.\nThe Detroit Red Wings added some depth to their defense on Friday, signing former University of Michigan defenseman Jon Merrill to a one-year deal.\nMerrill spent the last three seasons with the Vegas Golden Knights after starting his career with the New Jersey Devils.\nI\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t have strong feelings about this signing. He\u2019s a cheap depth guy on a one-year deal, so I\u2019m down with that, but I have no feelings about Merrill himself either way.\nJersey number geek notes: Merrill wore #24 at Michigan and Antti Tuomisto isn\u2019t coming over this year so I\u2019ll guess Merrill takes that number with Detroit.<|endoftext|>We're just one month away from the release of Avengers: Endgame, and Marvel Studios is celebrating with a new batch of character posters in support of the film. Sporting the tagline \"Avenge the Fallen,\" the posters are all close-ups of characters' faces, and as expected, many of them confirm what the trailers have already told us.\nWe know already that the film will feature the survivors of Thanos' (Josh Brolin) snap \u2014 among them Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Iron Man (Tony Stark), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) \u2014 enacting some kind of last-ditch plan to take back what they lost, with a little help from their new friend Captain Marvel (Brie Larson). Those characters, in keeping with the most recent trailer, are shown in color on their posters. Characters who didn't survive \u2014 including Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Vision (Paul Bettany), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) \u2014 appear in black and white.\nThis is all pretty easy to follow, but what makes this batch of posters particularly interesting is that they seem to confirm a few things we didn't know for sure about various supporting characters, and the biggest news seems to be that Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) is alive and well following the snap, and will apparently join the fight in the new film. Thor's new ally and fan-favorite character from Thor: Ragnarok was last seen onboard the Asgardian refugee ship at the end of that film, but didn't make an appearance in Avengers: Infinity War, leading many fans to worry about her eventual fate.\nAlso alive: Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), Tony's loyal bodyguard and friend who was last seen in Spider-Man: Homecoming, and Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), Tony's fiance. Sadly, the posters also confirm some people we lost off-camera, like Shuri (Letitia Wright), Black Panther's science genius little sister. That's a gut punch.\nNotably, the posters also include three characters who died in the last film in ways other than the snap: Loki, who was choked to death by Thanos; Gamora, who was thrown of a cliff by Thanos; and Vision, who was killed when Thanos ripped the Mind Stone from his skull.\nObviously we don't expect characters like Black Panther and Spider-Man to stay dead forever, and the Avengers' ultimate plan is expected to restore a lot of things to the MCU, but will that include characters who were dead before the snap even happened? This remains one of the film's biggest mysteries, and these posters only add to the suspense. Check out all of the posters assembled via Marvel's official Twitter account below.\nAvengers: Endgame arrives April 26.<|endoftext|>Transparent Optical Switches: Technology Issues and Challenges\n\nIncreased traffic volume due to the introduction of new broadband services is driving carriersto the deployment of an optical transport layer based on Wavelength Division Multiplexing(WDM) [1]. The network infrastructure of existing core networks is currently undergoing atransformation from rings using SONET Add/Drop Multiplexers (ADMs) to mesh topologiesusing Optical Cross-connects (OXCs). A core optical network architecture can be opaque ortransparent. An opaque architecture means that the optical signal carrying traffic undergoesan Optical to Electronic to Optical (OEO) conversion at different places in the network. Atransparent architecture means that the optical signal carrying traffic stays in the opticaldomain from the time it is generated at the edge of the network until it leaves the network.Even though the applications driving thelarge scaledeployment of transparent optical switches are notcurrently in place (niche applications in today\u2019s networks onlyuse a very small number of transparent switches), and the trafficdemand does notcurrently justify theuse of transparentswitches that are cost effective at very high bit rates,it is possible that atsome point in the futuretransparent switches may be deployed in the network. Based on thisassumption, this paper explores the technology issues and challenges that are associated with3D MEMS-based switch fabrics. These fabrics offer the most viable approach to makesingle-stage switch fabrics with large portcounts that can be used for thedeployment of transparent switches in the network.Figure illustrates the four different node architectures that can comprise a core optical1network. The first architecture shows a fixed patch panel. Fixed patch panels located betweenWDM systems with transponders are currently being replaced by opaque (OEO) switchingnodes (with electrical switch fabrics) as shown in architectureof Figure (b). This is an1 opaque network architecture, as the optical signal undergoes OEO conversions [2]. The thirdarchitecture shows a transparent (OOO) switch between WDM systems with transpondersthat iscomplemented by an OEO switch for drop traffic. This is once again an opaquenetwork architecture, as the optical signal undergoes OEO conversions at the WDM<|endoftext|>The incidents of sexual harassment and other form of violence against women are skyrocketing at an alarming rate. It is undeniable that this rape culture did not grow overnight.\nThere is an underlying reason for it: A culture of impunity. But the time is now to fight back against violence against women.\nAfter a home-maker was raped and tortured on September 2 in Begumganj upazila of Noakhali, people from all around the country began protesting for justice.\nWhat\u2019s ridiculous is that the police, who are responsible for ensuring the safety of all citizens, came to know about this heinous incident over a month later when footage of the assault went viral on Facebook. This is a reflection of how prompt police officers are at fulfilling their key responsibilities.\nThis is not a rare case in the history of Bangladesh. There have been numerous times when women had to experience harassment in schools, workplaces, and outside.\nAccording to Ain O Salish Kendra, from January to September this year, 975 women were raped, 43 of whom died after, and 12 committed suicide after being raped.\nA media report says that the number of rape incidents was 1,413 last year. This clearly demonstrates that occurrences of sexual harassment is widespread. And these are only the ones which have been reported.\n If no, what is the judiciary doing? What are the police officers for? What are the judges for?\nAround 200,000 cases of abuse involving women and children are pending in 64 districts across the country.\nOut of them, 40,000 have been pending for more than five years; nearly 70% of these 40,000 cases have been waiting more than 10 years to be disposed of.\nSeeing these frustrating statistics of negligence by the justice departments, it can definitely be said that a culture of impunity is one of the prime reasons for such a spike in rape cases"

I would highly recommend holiuni.\nI would highly recommend this course to anyone who is wants to get into Yin Yoga and incorporate Yin Yoga in their teachings. I\u2019m a yoga teacher who teaches the elderly, mostly through local hospitals. Therefore the chapters on modifications of poses and alternatives using props and support were very beneficial.\nI loved taking this course, really recommend it. Both the theoretical and practical parts are well explained, I could study without any problems.\nClear and structured. The videos offer high quality content and it\u2019s great that you can watch them again. I feel confident to start teaching Yin Yoga.\nOnce you have found the time to fit this course into your own personal schedule, it is comprehensive. Very detailed explanation and also gives the possibility to go to an even deeper level and to do research. Really enjoyed the course so far.\nFor me this was the best option to follow the course.

There is no higher power who decides whats right and whats wrong. Morals are subjective and crucial for a species survival. Thus they vary from individual to individual, group to group. There is only one way to decide which is the most successfull or the \"best\" and that is conflict. You can think of it like darwanism, might makes right, survival of the fittest or if you want to be less philisophical, a comon example of conflict deciding morales is a political debate. Verbal confict between two ore more parties resulting in the winner being able to enforce/ implement their way.\nEdit: here is a wall of text<|endoftext|>[Weekender] Like it hot!\nLate last month, two giant chili statues occupied a corner of Seoul Plaza, in front of City Hall, drawing interest from foreign tourists and passers-by. The air carried the unmistakable scent of the fiery spice.\nFarmers\u2019 booths nearby had loads of freshly harvested, sun-dried red chilies, ready to be ground into gochu-garu -- chili powder -- or to be aged into thick, fermented chili paste, gochujang.\nThe Aug. 27-29 Yeongyang H.O.T. Festival led to on-the-spot sales and delivery orders for chilies and related farm products totaling nearly 2 billion won ($1.7 million), organizers said.\nFrom mid-August to this week, three more such events were held in rural towns famous for their chilies: Eomseong, Goesan and Cheongyang.\nSouth Korea is in its peak season for red hot chili peppers. In late summer and early fall, the pungent spice, which provides the basis for the heat and color of many Korean dishes, arrives at the market in its best form and in abundance.\nKang Gyeong-sook, a 60-something housewife, visited Seoul Plaza to bulk purchase the peppers.\n\u201cChili is the most important spice.\u201d she said without hesitation.\nWhat she had in mind was the approaching gimjang -- the kimchi-making season in early winter, when families prepare a large quantity of the pickled cabbage dish for consumption throughout the year.\n\u201cDuring the gimjang season, chili prices go up,\u201d Kang\u2019s friend chimed in. They were each looking to buy at least 12 kilograms of dried chilies, or 20 geun in the traditional Korean unit of weight.\nKorea\u2019s per-capita chili consumption stood at around 3 kilograms in 2017, down from 3.7 kilograms in 2013. That is about 8 grams of chilies per day. It is the most consumed vegetable here.\nThe small, fiery fruit is now such an integral part of Korean cuisine that even toddlers have their daily fix of kimchi -- though it could be a milder version -- even before they learn how to use chopsticks.\nHowever, it was only in the postwar era that Koreans began to develop such a deep fondness for the spice.\nChilies are believed to have first arrived here in the 16th century and were widely cultivated in the 18th century. But until the 1950s, they did not have such a big presence on Korean dining tables.\nAccording to Ahn Jung-youn, a researcher at the National Folk Museum of Korea, the stress of postwar society sparked the popularity of chilies.\n\u201cThe Korean War and the years that followed were no doubt a time of extreme difficulties. \u2026 There is a link between a society\u2019s stress level and the yearning for spicy food,\u201d she said.\nAs the nation recovered from the war and rebuilt its economy at an unprecedented speed,"

She was an avid reader and loved her travels with Reid and friends to Asia, Europe, nearly every state, and many cruises. Some of her fondest years were the eleven spent at Camp Parsons, a Boy Scout camp on Hood Canal where Reid and her son and daughter worked as staff members. Barbara also worked part-time in several Bellevue Public Schools as a library aide.\nBarbara and Reid spent the 30 plus years of retirement at the family home on Bainbridge Island that Reid grew up in. She treasured the many friends and neighbors in their community, always offering a smile and time to chat. Her book club gatherings in later years were a highlight. She devoted many volunteer hours at the Bainbridge Island Historical Museum, Bainbridge Senior Center, and the Seattle Children\u2019s Bainbridge Bargain Boutique. She loved to play cards, particularly pinochle, and do crossword puzzles.\nBarbara was preceded in death by her parents, sister Dorothy Jean, and son Michael Reid.

I was one among the 15 participants selected for the first OLC-South Asia Course of 10 month duration, with online and two residential modules of 10 days (Near Mumbai, Maharashtra, April, 2012) and 7 days (http://www.ifoam.bio/en/olcsouth-asia-2012 ) in Bangalore (November, 2012). As a part of this training, each one of us created Development Plans (DPs) to be pursued after completion of the course.\nFrom the 60 applications they received, 24 participants from 18 countries were selected for a 6 days training at Goesan, South Korea, during 24-29 April, 2017. Well in advance, the IFOAM Academy published a document describing the profile of the course participants, indicating their achievements in context of their DPs (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0TX5SvS4lMRVUx3ZkVLaUpod2s/view. Also, well before the start of the current course, the programme schedule was mailed to all the participants (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0TX5SvS4lMRblN1cDF5Vmd6ZXM/view.\nThe Honorable Deputy Governor of the Goesan province, addressed the participants, who were introduced to him by the course Director. The inauguration activity was crisp and finished as per schedule within 30 minutes.\nWell planned technical sessions were mostly group exercises with presentation by the course participants, wherein, presentation methods like world caf\u00e9, open space, fish bowl, cards, charts, etc., were used. These sessions were interactive and participatory, enabling everyone to contribute to the discussions, thus making the methodology used, a good, participatory experience.\nproduce products believing human and nature as well as the urban and rural areas are connected in the string of life. The consumers buy the products, relating to this thought of the producers. It is a good concept worth replicating in other developing countries, though it has its own set of issues. We also visited an organic farm by name 10 Farmers, which was diverse in its produce and had its own retail store to sell its farm produce.\nThe course participants continue to send their free and frank feedback on the course, which is highly appreciative. The constructive criticism of the course (Box 1), in fact, may be used by the IFOAM Academy to improve this course in the future. Many participants including myself felt the duration of the course could have been a little longer, maybe 10 days. The course director assured that the feedback will be analyzed and a general reflection on this course would be shared in coming days. The participants were also interested to have more interactions with organic farmers there and listen to their practical experiences to contrast the experiences with the farmers back home. Maybe the time constraint did not allow this, nevertheless, many of us felt the need for it.\nMy expectation was, as master class alumni, we should have come up with at least an organic leadership output that can be country/region specific, based on the organic leadership course, our DPs and experiences \u2013 for scaling up. For example, it could be an organic leadership training design that would be appropriate for the agriculture policy makers or for organic practitioners and/or for agricultural extension workers. In this way, there will be a training guide developed by a pool of experts on how to train future organic leaders in their respective areas. It will also be a good attachment for proposal on organic training funding. I hope this will be taken into consideration as one idea on future master class.\nProgram/ workshop topics may be reconsidered, clear statement before outset or at start of class on expectations and outcomes from the course \u2013 in collaboration with participants, excursions built in earlier in the program. These were really excellent and well chosen (Hansalim, 10 Farmers etc), and they gave great insight into organic agriculture, direct selling and consumer organization. Development Plan tactic \u2013 further development plan for each participant perhaps? Longer course could be considered, for various reasons (including jetlag?)as we took time to start interacting as a group, group exercises / icebreakers at the start, to develop trust and ideas between members, we went immediately into output mode. Topic suggestions: Participate in discussions about the future of organic agriculture e.g., Vision development or envision, the future of organic; fuller examination of Organic 3.0 and concepts and how and what to implement; suggestions on how to improve organic agriculture and take-up in each Participant\u2019s local context; selecting success stories/ identifying elements that might work in the participants\u2019 local context, and replicating and scaling organic agriculture success stories.\nWhile we are slowly receiving everyone\u2019s feedback, do we also try and find a way \u2013 collectively (but virtually), to envision and create a \u201cwhere do we go from here\u201d plan? I remember we didn\u2019t quite formulate one or didn\u2019t reach a consensus. That, or we just let it be? \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019ve been going over my notes and the common theme has been: local, empowerment, communicating to the grassroots/farmers/smallholders, cultural shifts and a more enabling environment versus regulation. Let me know what everyone thinks, and if you all want to move this forward with a commitment to a project/initiative or if we just let it be.\nI enjoyed OLC a lot; agree with most of your comments. Personally, I think it was a pity we did not have more time to present success stories of our work in more detail. People can always share the best topics they are really into, frontal talks maybe old-fashioned but input can be very good.\nI would have liked to discuss and examine more of the Organic 3 as mentioned by Tracy and Ailbhe. This will be on another occasion and probably at Organic World Congress 2017 in India. I agree with Ailbhe, that we should have discussed on how to improve organic agriculture in each participant\u2019s local context. As Mahesh said, the value chain and group / cooperative farming approach being done by Hansalim, is an excellent model to follow in our countries. Finally, David\u2019s idea for the creation of an OLC Alumni Network is a priority to take advantage of international expertise in the organic field. From my part, I suggest the creation of a platform reserved for distance learning courses with discussion forums. These courses could deal with very specific aspects such as composting, organic intensification, organic innovations, etc.\nThe Course Director responded to the feed- back and gave his equally frank reflection on the course (Box2).\nWhile applying to the course, the prospective participants were asked to submit a motivation letter, as to why they want to participate in this course? On completion of the course, in their feedback, they have mentioned whether their expectations from the course were met or not. The course participants took a keen interest in giving their constructive feedback with an intent to see similar programmes being organized in a better way.\nThe programme focused on technical content, presentations, and learning and sharing from the experiences of diverse set of participants in a participatory mode. It\u2019s a good practice worth replicating in training programmes that are organized. The inaugural session was so brief and took only 30 minutes, which helped by providing adequate time for other more relevant sessions.\nProfessional way of handling the programme, the logistics, catering, accommodation, transport etc., were outstanding. These lessons could be useful to make training programmes organized by us more impactful.\nThere were a lot of positive outcomes, especially the opportunity to"

Adopted at three years old in 1984 by loving parents, Kara was mostly disinterested in finding her birth family. But when Kara became a mother and her daughter approached the same age as when she was abandoned, Kara couldn\u2019t understand why her mother would give her up. Kara began an intense search to find her parents.\nKara researched adoptee forums on Facebook, adoptee rights organizations, and online genealogy platforms.

The program is designed to empower family physicians with new ways to promote physical activity, nutrition, and emotional well-being for the entire family. The endeavor will be administered by Americans In Motion (AIM), an AAFP initiative that improves the health of all Americans through multifaceted fitness programs.\n\"In order to combat childhood obesity effectively, we need to target not just the children, but the entire family,\" said Jim King, M.D., president of the AAFP. \"Children learn by example, and a household that, as a unit, makes sure to include regular exercise and balanced diets in its day-to-day life is much more likely to have children who are happy and healthy.\"\nThe partnership will produce and distribute an educational DVD and children's book, for use in physician waiting rooms, that encourages patients to talk with family physicians about fitness and to work together to develop a plan that enables sustained healthy lifestyle choices among family members. The educational materials, due to be distributed in the spring and summer of 2009 to more than 36,600 family physicians and 457 family medicine residency training programs, will be available in both English and Spanish. The materials will discuss fitness for the family, with a special emphasis on ways to maintain fitness for children through a balance of physical activity, nutrition, and emotional well-being.\n\"The family physician can help combat the growing threat of childhood obesity, by providing families with much-needed information from a trusted source,\" said Sibyl Jacobson, president of MetLife Foundation. \"MetLife Foundation is pleased to help support this program, which offers information about the importance of making smart decisions that can result in longer, healthier lives.\"\nToday's children may have a shorter life expectancy than their parents because of obesity-related illnesses. Almost 60 percent of Americans do not get sufficient daily exercise, and almost 65 percent of Americans are overweight or obese. The family physician conducts 210 million patient visits each year, and is in a strong position to positively influence the fitness habits of their patients, helping to fight childhood obesity on a national scale.\nMetLife Foundation was established by MetLife in 1976 to carry on its longstanding tradition of corporate contributions and community involvement.

Let readers understand the true(non- mainstream media) dynamic at play. PM Justin Trudeau informs Canadian that our nation has a serious problem of an aging demographic and workforce.\nHis pit-bull from Somalia, Immigration Minister MP Ahmed Hussen, tells Canada we must maintain the highest immigration quotas per-capita in the western world, in order to off-set a lack of Canadian workers. Over 90% of these imports come from Hussen\u2019s chosen African, Islamic and Third World nations. These are Hussen\u2019s people, and this is who he chooses to import\u2013even the illegal ones.\nWhat government or media never speak of is the fact that our current and previous governments could have set up programs to motivate Canadians to have more children in lieu of a problem that has been understood for DECADES. They did no such thing.\nWhat was set up was the most open, no-limits, FULL-TERM permissible fetus destruction. The man who created this was Pierre Trudeau. It was he who placed a European refugee in charge of the program\u2013a man named Dr. Henry Morgantaler.\nThis sketchy fellow claimed to have personally performed 5000 abortions. At the time, his behaviour was against the law. Memories of Trudeau Dynasty?

        "passage": "etic two-week marathon of the United Nations Framework Convention Climate Change negotiations that take place very December.\nThe IPCC meeting came just after the news broke that greenhouse gas levels have reached 400 parts per million in the Arctic for the first time.\nThis is an important threshold. It is more than 800,000 years since there was this much CO2 in the atmosphere. The 2007 IPCC assessment stated that to avoid dangerous changes to our climate, global greenhouse gas levels have to be stabilized at 350 ppm. To get there, a global commitment is needed to reduce CO2 emissions by 40 per cent by 2020 over 1990 levels. There was supposed to be a new binding climate change treaty by 2009. Instead, the negotiations nearly collapsed that year in Copenhagen and since then governments have produced only fine statements, a framework for further negotiations and reduced targets.\nSince 2009, Canada, the United States and other countries have latched on to unscientific targets that make good sound bites. Canada and the U.S. committed to reduce their emissions by 17 per cent over 2005 levels. Just to be sure no one was confused about the real commitment of the Harper government, Canada withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, making it the only country in the world to officially abrogate this binding international agreement.\nThis spring the government slashed environmental protection legislation and demonized environmental groups and anyone who dared to criticize its no-hold-barred push for \"responsible resource development.\" The message was clear: You are either for the economy or the environment. You can't be both.\nAny hope of a sensible climate change policy based on science and fact rather than ideology and rhetoric has all but vanished off the government's radar. As the National Roundtable on the Economy and Environment (NRTEE) reported recently, \"Canada will not achieve its 2020 GHG emission reductions target unless significant new, additional measures are taken. More will have to be done. No other conclusion is possible.\"\nOf course, the Harper government doesn't need this kind of advice. After 20 years, the NRTEE, a body established by Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, has had its funding eliminated. In the words of Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird, why should the government continue to pay for advice it doesn't want to hear?\nYou don't have to go very far to see what the consequences of this kind of position. For a government that claims to have Arctic interests at heart, the policies of the Harper government are relegating a vast portion of the region to irreversible change.\nOn Canada Day, while Harper cabinet ministers fanned across the country to wave flags, flip burgers, and deliver the uniform lines about jobs, prosperity and growth fashioned in the Prime Minister's office, an updated graphic appeared on the website of the National Snow and Ice Data Centre in Boulder, Colorado. The centre produces daily updates of real-time satellite tracking of the state of Arctic sea ice. On July 1, the graphic showed a continued drop in multi-year sea ice that indicates that 2012 could beat previous record lows from 2007.\nHumans are causing this problem. Yes, the climate has cycles and natural variation. But at no time in planetary history has this much warming occurred in such a short time. It's not caused by sunspots or volcanoes and it's above the levels of the natural cycle, all of which skeptics and their paymasters like to point to. And even if we weren't causing it, we would have to take precautionary measures to ensure that we can adapt to it.\nWhat we know as human civilization has developed in the clement period since the last ice age -- a period of about 10,000 years. One hundred centuries may seem like a long time to us but it is a blink of the geological eye. While the planet will eventually rebalance itself -- in thousands of years -- we need to ask ourselves if what we know as human society will be around to see it.\nSince we can't answer this question with certainty, we need to think deeply about where our political leaders are taking us, in this country and elsewhere.\nThere is no chance of a healthy economy without a livable environment.\nJohn Crump is a CCPA research associate and an expert on Arctic and global environmental issues.

In 2008 and 2009, the cultivars were tested for resistance to the Pc003 isolate collected in Youngyang, Gyeongbuk province. In 2010, the selected cultivars in the previous years were tested by inoculating with 3 isolates obtained from the pepper plants in Miryang in Gyeongnam province, Youngyang in Gyeongbuk province, and Goesan in Chungbuk province. A continuous variation in resistance from highly resistant to susceptible was observed among the commercial pepper cultivars. It was also noted that some cultivars, although their names were initiating with ``Yeokgang`` or ``PR`` meaning Phytophthora resistance, were very low in resistance or susceptible. When the resistant cultivars selected in 2008 and 2009 experiment were inoculated with the 3 isolates, all the commercial cultivars except a rootstock, ``Tantan``, succumbed to the exceptionally virulent Pc005 (Miryang) isolate. Pc002 (Goesan) was a little more virulent than Pc003 (Youngyang). A few cultivars resistant to Pc003 (Youngyang) were severely infected by Pc002 (Goesan). Significant interaction in analysis of variance suggested the differential interactions between cultivars and pathogen isolates. Strategies to breed cultivars having high level of resistance to the highly variable pathogenic fungus, Phytophthora capsici, were discussed.<|endoftext|>He will LOVE his Blowfish Vepper Space Boys\u2019 (13-5) Casual Shoe!

It was a couple of weeks into Orientation before I finally had the time and energy to spend a night out. It was the night after our placement ceremony, and I wanted to celebrate.

During Joseph Conrad\u2019s lifetime, little objectiveness was made over his 1899 novel Heart of Darkness. This novel, which possibly has Conrad\u2019s numerous endowments as an author, has been perused as a scorching evaluation of European colonialism in Africa. It remains today, a standout amongst the most omnipresent matters in college course syllabi around the United States and with it comes a various range of perspectives, studies, and emotions.\nIt goes to lengths to scrutinize the prudence of ill-natured Europeans, so intensely established in the social cognizance of the book. It makes a point of demonstrating the unsafe impacts the colonial exertion has on the mind of both its narrator and its focal character, Marlow. Which is all to state that it is no longer astounding that such a commonly perused work ought to be the concern of a lot of controversies.\nThis 1899 novel by Joseph Conrad is showing how the author is struggling with his acceptance with having a bigoted viewpoint and encompasses colonialism by nature with stories of imperialist conquest. For the first situation, the controversy begins with how Conrad\u2019s writings are often proclaimed as a triumph of anti-colonial estimation; however, it is just as racist as anyone would primarily anticipate nineteenth-century writings on Africa to be. In Daniel and Brigit Marie-Katkin\u2019s article, these two are criticizing the nature of Joseph Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness and its contention of the crude appeal and the manner of acculturated appearances of wickedness disadvantaging the African people by Marlow and his Company men.\nAfricans move toward becoming Marlow\u2019s focal point, with who he can play out his philosophical and existential battles. Their reality and their exoticism empower his self-examination. In Todd Kuchta\u2019s article imagology gives an ideologically unbiased strategy for investigation and targets the focal point"

And this is normally correct if RET process is fast, but still need to check if concentrations of quenching species such as H 2 O to OH is very high [54,[68][69][70]. Furthermore, the laser power needs to be kept low and linear LIF is achieved to avoid stimulated emission and large depletion of initial pumped state density.\nIn many cases the excitation radiations locate range of deep UV (e.g., <100 nm) and are strongly absorbed by ambient gaseous medium (e.g., air or water molecules), then two-photon excitation in the UV spectral range (>200 nm) can be applied for the same diagnostic purpose, namely the so-called two-photon absorption LIF (TA-LIF) [49]. Compared to single-photon LIF, TA-LIF is considerably less efficient and the excitation rate scales with the square of laser power. Normally higher laser power is required to produce detectable fluorescence intensity, but laser stimulated effects including photon-ionization, induced breakdown, stimulated emission, etc. needs to be avoided [71,72]. Table 3 lists excitation schemes of TA-LIF for various active atomic species in plasmas. An example of twodimensional distribution of atomic oxygen in an atmospheric-pressure plasma jet-source by TA-LIF is presented in Figure 4.\n\nAbsorption spectroscopy\nAnother important diagnostic technique for atmospheric-pressure plasmas is absorption spectroscopy (AS) [77]. Compared to LIF or OES approaches, AS is an in\n\nSpecies\nExcitation transition Fluorescence transition Calibration Ref.\nRayleigh of air [50][51][52][53][54] NO NO gas [55][56][57][58][59] Rayleigh [65,66]   situ and non-invasive technique probing absolute densities of interested species without need of extra calibration and independent on collisional quenching process. It relies on the Beer-Lambert law: where I s is the light intensity passing through sample, I 0 is the incident radiation, N is species density, \u03c3\u03bb \u00f0\u00deis the wavelength dependent absorption cross-section, and L is the absorption path-length. If probed species density is low, the absorption length is normally increased by using a multi-pass spectroscopic absorption cell where light reflects between two mirrors, e.g., the Herriott cell [78]. However, if for micro-plasmas this technique maybe not sensitive enough if species density is not high to obtain a distinct absorbance signal.\nThe sensitivity of absorption measurements is strongly dependent on the stability of used light source. Various types of light sources, narrow-band or broadband with wavelength range from VUV to mid-infrared, are applied together with high spectral resolution detection system such as spectrometer or FTIR. AS by laser light sources, particularly tunable diode-lasers or quantum cascade lasers are attractive light sources have been applied to measure species densities in micro-plasmas [8, 79,80]. These laser sources output specific wavelengths of large absorption cross-sections and enable fine scan of wavelength to obtain a clear absorption line profile, and from which species density and even gas temperature are able to be derived.\nWavelength selectivity is important in the implementation of AS technique as absorption may overlap by multi-species. And, it should be mentioned that absorption measurements yield line-integrated densities and spatial distribution is achievable by Abel inversion. Special efforts are required for non-uniform micro-plasmas by AS approach, since gas temperature and species density are spatially dependent. In this case broadband absorption can provide more details for deriving both the gas temperature and species density [81,82]. An example of OH density determination by broadband UV absorption in an atmospheric-pressure pin-to-water discharge is depicted in Figure 5 [83].\nAnother quite sensitive approach by using a cavity of two highly reflective mirrors is the cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) [84]. The laser pulse goesand-back in the cavity and that effectively enhances the absorption path length in the probed gas sample by several orders of magnitude. The time-decay of light intensity leaking from the cavity depends on the reflectivity of mirrors and species density in the cavity. Based on that the species density is able to be obtained with the known mirror reflectivity. In addition to the high sensitivity, compared to absorption spectroscopy, CRDS is independent on fluctuations of light intensity since a time constant rather than an absolute absorbance is measured. More details of CRDS technique are included in Refs. [84][85][86][87][88][89][90].\n\nSummary\nHigh-end diagnostic techniques have been applied to atmospheric-pressure plasmas. Even for highly transient non-uniform micro-plasmas, reliable insights of discharge properties are able to be achieved. This chapter includes several important advanced diagnostic approaches specifically for plasma parameters and reactive plasma species. Two approaches are suggested for a same diagnostic purpose, for example, the determination of gas temperature or electron density, and compared to ensure and increase the measurement accuracy, particularly for atmospheric-pressure plasmas. Other important plasma properties, such as densities of ion species and ion flux, surface charges, have been investigated as well and related diagnostic techniques can be found in above (review) references.

It figures the values and norms of countless components of daily life since thru formal training, necessary life capabilities are purchased. As an illustration, doctors undergo a long time when several years of instruction so as to procedure medicine and preserve lives. Technicians conversely are capable of construct structures, think of critical scientific facts and share superb expertise in their areas of specializations as a result of knowledge. All positions originate from educating youngsters from an early period of amongst 3 and 5 and directed them to the right focus till they can choose a path in your life by themselves.\nLearning, whether formal or informal, can be explained as the skill of having practical knowledge, valuations, values and behaviors. Via knowledge the significantly less privileged people from the society get opportunities to mature and turn significant. This is the path which offers provision for public fairness in spite of the location about the world. In the nation as an example, in between the many years of 1950 and 1970, the African American citizen network enjoyed a cheaper literacy grade as compared to the white colored local community. This improved upon by 50 plus% via the season 2012 and also results this has had for the life criteria within the overall neighborhood is remarkable. Eventually, and also this aided foster much better interaction among African American citizen college students and people from the bright descent. Even if this excellent growth, many people continue to suffer because of social social gaps the place that the unique have the ability to provide much better finding out the opportunity their young children while very poor persons cannot afford this. Right from infancy, these privileged children will be able to end up being more effective people than their competitors free plagiarism checker no word limit from much less privileged family homes.\nThe training system is different from state to state but simply has amounts from infancy through college and article-university. Usually, one particular graduated pupils in one point to the next through sitting down for any assessment and attaining the necessary pass quality or its comparable.

All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, unless otherwise specified.\nThe plant parts of A. distichum including flower, leaf and branch were collected at Jangyyeon-myeon Goesan-gun Korea. Five hundred grams of fresh parts was extracted with 1,000 mL of 80% methanol with shaking for 24 h. The methanol-soluble fraction was filtered and concentrated to approximately 20 mL volume using a vacuum evaporator and a fraction was placed in a separating funnel. The ethyl acetate fraction was separated from the mixture, evaporated by a vacuum evaporator and prepared aseptically and kept in a refrigerator until use.\nMouse macrophage cell line, RAW264.7 cells was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin. The cells were maintained 37\u2103 under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Ethyl acetate fraction from A. distichum (EAFAD) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and then treated to cells. DMSO was used as a vehicle and the final DMSO concentration was no exceeded 0.1% (v/v).\nRAW264.7 cells were plated in 12-well plate for overnight. Cells were pre-treated with the extracts at the indicated concentrations for 2 h and then co-treat with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for the additional 18 h. After 18 h, 200 \u03bcL of the media was mixed with equal amount of Griess reagent (1% sulfanilamide and 0.1% N-1-(naphthyl) ethylenediamine-diHCl in 2.5% H3PO4). The mixture was incubated for the additional 5 min at the room temperature and the absorbance was measured at 540 nm.\nTotal RNA was prepared using a RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and total RNA (1 \u03bcg) was reverse-transcribed using a Verso cDNA Kit (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol for cDNA synthesis. PCR was carried out using PCR Master Mix Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) with primers for mouse iNOS and mouse GAPDH as follows: mouse iNOS: forward 5\u2019-gtgctgcctctggtcttgcaagc-3\u2019, and reverse 5\u2019-agggg caggctgggaattcg-3\u2019, mouse GAPDH: forward 5\u2019-caggagcgag accccactaacat-3\u2019 and reverse 5\u2019-gtcagatccacgacggacacatt-3\u2019.\nNuclear and cytosolic fractions were prepared following the manufacturer's protocols of nuclear extract kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Briefly, RAW264.7 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS containing phosphatase inhibitors and harvested with 1xhypotonic buffer for 15 min at 4\u2103. After adding detergent, the cells were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min and then the supernatants were collected as cytoplasmic fraction. Nuclear fractions were collected by suspending nuclear pellet with lysis buffer and centrifugation.\nCells were washed with 1 \u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Boston Bio Products, Ashland, MA, USA) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma Aldrich) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma Aldrich), and centrifuged at 12,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4\u2103. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. The proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were blocked for non-specific binding with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1h at room temperature and then incubated with specific primary antibodies in 5% nonfat dry milk at 4\u2103 overnight. After three washes with TBS-T, the blots were incubated with horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated immunoglobulin G (IgG) for 1 h at room temperature and chemiluminescence was detected with ECL Western blotting substrate (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized in Polaroid film.\nTransient transfection was performed using PolyJet DNA transfection reagent (SignaGen Laboratories, Ijamsville, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Briefly, RAW264.7 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and incubated overnight. Then, plasmid mixtures containing 1 \u03bcg of pNF-\u03baB-Luc plasmid and 0.1 \u03bcg of pRL-null vector were transfected for 24 h. After transfection, cells were pre-treated with the extracts for 2 h and then co-treated with LPS for an additional 15 h. The cells were harvested in 1 x luciferase lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was measured and normalized to the pRL-null luciferase activity using a dual-luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).\nA statistical analysis was performed with the Student\u2019s unpaired t-test, with statistical significance set at * P < 0.05.\nUnder stimulation, macrophages-generated NO plays an important role in inflammatory response. Thus, we used the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 cells for evaluating anti-inflammatory effect of the part of A. distichum. To determine if the parts of A. distichum could reduce NO generation by LPS, RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with the extracts from the parts of A. distichum (EAFAD) for 2 h and then co-treated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for the additional 18 h. As shown in Fig. 1, treatment of LPS without EAFAD induced NO overproduction in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, while pretreatment of all EAFADs suppressed LPS-mediated NO overproduction. Among EAFADs, the inhibitory effect of NO production was highest in the treatment of EAFAD-L (extracts from the leaf of A. distichum). Thus, we chose EAFAD-L for further studies.\nFig. 1Effect of EAFAD on NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. RAW264.7 cells were pre-treated with EAFAD at the indicated concentrations for 2 h and then co-treated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for the additional 18 h. After treatment, NO production was measured using the media and Griess reagent. DMSO was used as a vehicle. Values given are the mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3). *p < 0.05 compared to LPS treatment without EAFAD. EAFAD-F, EAFAD-L and EAFAD-B means the ethyl acetate fraction from the flower (EAFAD-L), leaf (EAFAD-L) and branch (EAFAD-B) of A. distichum.\nSince NO production is regulated by iNOS expression, the effect of EAFAD-L on iNOS expression was evaluated by Western blot and RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1A, LPS overexpression was detected in the cells stimulated LPS alone. However, EAFAD-L inhibited iNOS expression in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. For the further study for evaluating whether inhibitory effect of EAFAD-L against the expression of iNOS protein is mediated from regulating iNOS transcription, we also determined the mRNA level of iNOS regulated by EAFAD-L in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, the treatment of EAFAD-L attenuated the mRNA expression of iNOS. These data indicates that EAFAD-L may reduce iNOS expression through suppressing iNOS transcription.\nFig. 2Effect of EAFAD-L on iNOS expression in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. For Western blot (A), cells were pre-treated with indicated concentrations of EAFAD-L for 2 h and then co-treated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for an additional 15 h. DMSO was used as a vehicle. Cell lysates (30 \u03bcg) were resolved by 10% SDS\u2013PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with antibodies against iNOS. The proteins were then visualized using ECL detection. \u03b2-actin was used as an internal control. For RT-PCR (B), cells were pre-treated with indicated concentrations of EAFAD-L for 2 h and then co-treated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for an additional 15 h. Total RNA was isolated and RT-PCR was performed for iNOS. GAPDH was used as an internal control for RT-PCR.\nTo elucidate the effect of EAFAD-L on NF-\u03baB activation, we firstly carried out a Western blot for I\u03baB-\u03b1 degradation in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, LPS induced I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation and subsequent I\u03baB-\u03b1 degradation at 15 min after the stimulation. However, pretreatment of EAFAD-L blocked LPS-induced I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation in a dose-dependent manner.\nFig. 3.Inhibitory effect of EAFAD-L against NF-\u03baB activation.

The old typical translation, pao cai (salted fermented vegetables), would be retired.\nThe situation stems from the reality there\u2019s no Chinese character to characterize the pronunciation of kimchi. As a result, the Ministry of Agriculture reportedly regarded some 4,000 Chinese characters right before choosing on xinqi, professing that it sounded type of like kimchi.\nXinqi (\u8f9b\u5947) is composed of two Chinese characters: Xin implies spicy. Qi suggests exceptional, or curious.\nWith the new identify, the Seoul authorities hopes to draw a distinct line among Korean kimchi and Chinese pickled vegetables \u2014 the latter of which are named pao cai (\u6ce1\u83dc) in China.\n\u201cWith the use of phrase \u2018xinqi\u2019 for Kimchi in Chinese, the ministry expects Korean kimchi and Chinese pao cai are differentiated clearly and the recognition of South Korea\u2019s classic dish, kimchi will be elevated in China,\u201d the release reported.\nThe new guideline is mandated for the South Korean authorities and affiliated organizations. But it is only a advice for non-public South Korean organizations that need to translate the term kimchi into Chinese, in addition to Chinese media talking about the Korean dish.\nNevertheless it has kicked off a wave of heated debates among media and netizens in the two nations.\nWhat is actually the difference involving kimchi and pao cai?\nRight before diving any more into the quarrel, a single really should have an understanding of the variance amongst kimchi and pao cai.\nKimchi is a collective time period for a lot more than 100 forms of fermented veggies in Korea, but it most usually refers to fermented napa cabbage with seasonings, such as purple chili pepper, garlic, ginger and salted seafood.\nFermented vegetables produced with distinct components like chonggak kimchi (fermented radish kimchi) or with lower spice levels such as baek kimchi (non-spicy white cabbage kimchi) also drop below the kimchi umbrella.\nA kimchi-building pageant in Goesan, South Korea, on November 7, 2020. A lot of the manufacturing unit-produced kimchi eaten in South Korea now will come from China.\nPao cai, on the other hand, actually suggests \u201csoaked vegetables\u201d in Chinese. That is simply because pickled veggies are normally made by soaking distinct varieties of greens, from cabbages to carrots, in a saline option, with or devoid of seasonings. The jars of greens are then fermented at room temperature.\nMainly because they bear some similarities, kimchi is normally referred to as \u201changuo pao cai,\u201d which means \u201cKorean fermented vegetables,\u201d in China.\nThis isn\u2019t South Korea\u2019s first try at building \u201cxinqi\u201d the de facto Chinese identify for kimchi.\nIn 2013, the Ministry of Agriculture lobbied for a new name in reaction to the increasing amount of China-made kimchi products in overseas marketplaces, as very well as in South Korea\u2019s domestic industry. Considering that 2006, South Korea has been struggling a kimchi trade deficit with China. From 2007 to 2011, the country\u2019s imports of kimchi solutions from China elevated by at the very least tenfold.\nA spicy sauce employed to make kimchi is organized through a conventional system regarded as \u2018kimjang\u2019, at a household in the South Korean port city of Donghae in 2020.\n\u201cKimchi is South Korea\u2019s national dish, not only mainly because Koreans consume it for approximately every meal, but also it is the most effectively-regarded Korean food stuff in the globe \u2014 a lot of Western"

It is directed to parents, but has some great points that apply in the classroom, too.\n\"Let your neighbors know that you love them in appropriate ways (aka: don\u2019t be weird). No one likes to be thought of as a project, but everyone wants to be seen, known, loved, and respected. As you look for opportunities to demonstrate genuine and authentic love to others, model these moments for your children. Identify ways your family could show love and care to someone in a way that he or she would feel seen, known, and authentically loved.\"\nJesus Washes the Disciples Feet at the Last Supper--we put together foot care packages for the local homeless shelter (which was housed at our church on Friday nights).\nMore mission and service project ideas for children and families and churches can be found in this topic: Missions, Missionaries, Service projects, including many that would be appropriate for a Day of Service on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.\nHere is a great blog post from Laurie's Little Monkeys with some good suggestions for service projects that children can actually do (rather than collecting food, toys, whatever...).\nThere are suggestions for animals (have someone from the animal shelter visit church and talk about animal care, then make dog treats or toys -- great for a creation stewardship mission workshop), caring for shut-ins and people in hospitals, projects to recognize community helpers, and more.\nOur new Writing Team lesson set on the Good Samaritan includes a variety of suggested service and outreach projects. The Parable of the Good Samaritan is a story that calls for action. One of the objectives of this lesson set is for the students to be able to identify persons \"in need\" within the their world (their \"Jericho road\") and think of actions they could take to show compassion and mercy to that person.\nBecause churches have different opportunities for \"Samaritan activities\" in their communities, we have created a collection of outreach suggestions with creative ideas for conducting them that you can adapt to your resources and the needs of your community. Supporting Members can access this lesson here.\nChoose a service activity or project to use as a weekly mission workshop during your Good Samaritan rotation for each group to rotate to.\nSchedule one special Sunday for kids to get involved in being good Samaritans with the rest of the congregation. Check out the post from Beth Tobin for inspiration.\nEncourage each family to choose their own community service project and have them take pictures to share on your church's social media with a hashtag such as #OurChurchGoesAndDoesLikewise or #ProjectGoodSamaritan or #NationalDayofService (be sure to tag Rotation.org, too, so we can see what you are doing!).\nNot a Supporting Member?

        "passage": " headed up by CEO, Eric Kimori, has a huge ambition \u2013 to establish world-class e-Community Centres that will promote Community ICT Development, promote e-learning and enhance youth employment through ICT strategies in a bid to address digital disparities by establishing a free, fast and reliable communication highway for marginalised rural communities. However, in many areas this is not possible as there is no internet access. Enter the Learn Appeal Capsule! Whilst the Capsule can\u2019t provide direct access to the internet, it will enable Complitkenya to establish e-community centres and give connected users within a range of 1km access to elearning and other relevant information stored on the Capsule via WiFi.\nEric has described the Capsule as being an \u2018invaluable reservoir of learning\u2019 which will make a huge difference to those who have no access to the internet. For the first time, many of them are now connected to the digital world.\nAs well as providing Capsules and content, we have provided mobile devices so that those who don\u2019t have their own devices are not further disadvantaged. Our initial pilot consisting of two centres has been a great success. The local people refer to the Capsule as the \u2018magic miracle box\u2019 and, in the 18 months the project has been running, the technology has not failed once. We hope to extend this to a further 8 centres early next year.\nOnce again Closer Still/Learning Technologies came up trumps and sponsored the first of these centres. We also received generous donations from Virtual College and Spirax Sarco to provide resources for the other nine. What we need now is content!\nGreen Malata is a project that we are sure all those in the learning community will engage with. The project is open to young people from the Chiuta Orphanage and all vulnerable youth in the area. There are 300 orphans in the surrounding villages and many one-parent families due to HIV Aids.\nUnemployment is very high, as there is hardly any economic activity and that\u2019s where together, using the Learn Appeal Capsule, we can help Green Malata to make a real step change!!\nThis project will help young people not only develop vocational skills, but also the entrepreneurial skills required to set up their own businesses. This initiative has the potential to have a huge impact both individually and on the community around them. The young people who gain these skills will be able to support themselves and grow their local economy.\nThe problem in this rural part of Malawi is not just internet access \u2013 there isn\u2019t any \u2013 there is no mains electricity either! The Learn Appeal Capsule can make a huge difference as it has been specifically designed not only to provide elearning content and resources via WiFi, but it also has an internal battery which lasts eighteen hours and can be recharged using a 12v battery so doesn\u2019t need mains electricity to provide learning.\nThis project is being supported by Virtual College who have provided a Capsule and WiFi enabled devices. However, we are also going to need relevant content that can provide these young people with the skills so that they will have the opportunities for success that we, so often, take for granted.\nAkiewhe Secondary School is located in a village with an estimated population of 6,000 people. The village is situated in Isoko North Local Government Area, of Delta State, in the Southern part of Nigeria. The Learn Appeal Capsule has made it possible to bring learning of vocational skills, mathematics and science subjects to the rural communities.\nThe second project is situated in the Northern part of Nigeria, in order to have a balance in the geographical and political structure of the country. These projects are being managed by Collins Ubido who says \u2013 \u201cThe potential of the Learn Appeal Capsule to transform the way learning is deployed in the rural communities in Africa is amazing. I am happy to give back to the rural dwellers a technology that will change the life of many people\u201d. Collins even managed to get an interview on a local Nigerian TV station to promote the project!\nDiabetes Outreach Prevention Programmes International (DOPPSI) is an international charitable organisation that aspires towards the education of peoples from all walks of life about diabetes prevention. Their mission is dedicated to provide education on prevention, early diagnosis and access to treatment of diabetes in the UK and worldwide. Our joint project is to provide offline access to learning so that being disconnected does not disadvantage health or life expectancy.\nTo make these projects a reality, Learn Appeal needs your support, so please contact us or email |||EMAIL_ADDRESS||| for more information about the projects themselves, sponsorship or providing content.<|endoftext|>madura argentina habla video pov him active with his feedback from the microscopic for a strapon.

When things are going poorly, it's advantageous to take corrective action before the internal scales are terribly out of balance.\nIt also applies to cases where they are able to compare their own performance favorably to that of others. The way in which the individual views the importance of different characteristics of the event impacts whether the reward will affect a person's intrinsic motivation for participating in that activity. They had to be constantly watched and reprimanded for non performance. Even though students are internally motivated to be powerful, they may not know how to achieve power responsibly. Summary Behavior is always purposeful.\nWhat do you understand by 'external' and 'internal' motivation?\nSo, yes, look for and use them all. Needless to say, he was the star of the game. Being internally motivated is most rewarding in that the activity or area of study naturally brings a person pleasure. However, we almost always have some control over our acting and thinking, two other components of total behavior. One was a drug addict and a drunk who frequently beat up his family. Instinct theory, drive theory, and humanistic theory are some of the examples of motivation theories Motivational studies are very important especially for managers in big companies. Activating the Desire to Learn by Bob Sullo Chapter 1.\nWhen we help students develop responsible ways to increase their personal power by gaining academic competence, they are less likely to seek power in destructive ways. Many people are motivated to sing karaoke despite their musical ability, for example. Take time to rest and think of ways how would you become productive. You no longer feel that it is work. External motivation is evident when someone behaves a particular way for reasons external to, or outside of, the person, such as money or coercion. Explaining the impetus for great works of art and other spontaneous human behaviors requires us to identify the shortcomings of the reward or punishment model and to reject it as incomplete. What is it that makes us want to do well\u2014 both on tests and in our lives? We make decisions based upon what we see and hear.\n If, after evaluation, the internal controls are found to be lacking, the external auditor can report the problems to the company, which can make any changes necessary to ensure more accurate accounting. The purpose of behavior is to feel better by keeping our internal scales in balance. Some students feel incapable of completing a task before they even try it. One way to do this is to always illustrate the concept at hand in another context after the students have fully grasped it in the current context. But this will only last for a season because it is not coming from a natural source intrinsic to you.\nThe reality is that change is difficult because, in all likelihood, you have been the way you currently are for a long time and your habits are deeply ingrained. This gives you a sense of beginning. With age, health concerns become more of a factor when choosing a beverage. I already lost those extra pounds, an I wish to lose another 10 pounds, but I feel I lost my motivation to restrict myself.

Press advertising can create quick responses and it also reaches a wide range of possible applicants actively looking for a new job. It's hard to feel better just because we want to.

The design and operations of systems and controls Internal auditor External auditor Internal auditing activity is primarily directed at improving internal control. If we hope to inspire more students to do high-quality work, we need to create learning environments that result in more students putting school, learning, and working hard into their internal world. Schools can be environments where students and staff satisfy this drive to connect and feel a sense of belonging. However this method can be expensive and it may attract too many candidates who are not in your chosen division.\nThe genetic instruction to be competent and to accomplish is especially important for educators.  The mission of the company will cover many areas of interest such as attracting potential customers and the service that is expected.

This means fewer workers handling the nation\u2019s growing load of mail, creating further delays in delivery. The answer to this, say the slap happy executives, is \u2013 guess what? \u2013 to cut even more \u201cservice\u201d out of postal service. They want to close hundreds of our local post offices and eliminate Saturday mail delivery (which is one of USPS\u2019 major competitive advantages).\nThis is Jim Hightower saying\u2026 Fed up with the deliberate degradation of this vital public service, postal workers themselves are putting forth a vision and innovative plan not merely for USPS to survive, but thrive.

Jack) and writer Russell T. Davies are in agreement over who would make a great \"next Doctor\"- and the choice would be another first. First, just to make something clear? While Bradley Walsh and Tosin Cole have left the show after \"Revolution of the Daleks,\" the abbreviated eight-episode Series 13 sees Yaz (Mandip Gill) returning with newly-introduced companion Dan (John Bishop) and Jodie Whittaker's Doctor still helming the TARDIS. But because this is why we can't have nice things anymore, the social media speculation has already ramped up with the assumption that the upcoming series will be Whittaker's last so folks are already trying to cast her replacement.\nPutting aside our personal feelings on how it's feeling especially disrespectful this time around (maybe because we have an issue with the BBC show getting so caught up in celebrating that they cast the first female Doctor that they forgot to actually do right by her during her run), Barrowman believes It's A Sin star Olly Alexander would be an excellent casting decision. Asked about it on ITV daytime talk show Lorraine, Barrowman said he thought the actor \"would be amazing, and I think he would make a wonderful Doctor.\" The casting would mark another first for the series, following up the casting of the first woman in the lead role with the casting of the first openly gay actor.\nDavies couldn't agree more, having cast Alexander in his upcoming Channel 4 limited series exploring the AIDS crisis of the 1980s on a personal level (and finds Alexander's character working of a Doctor Who set in the series). Speaking with SFX recently, Davies knew he was wading into clickbait territory when asked about Alexander's potential future as the Doctor but still threw his support behind his It's A Sin star. \"Oh stop it! This'll just be all the headlines. You just want SFX headlines everywhere,\" Davies responded. \"Yes, Olly would make a marvellous Doctor Who"

        "passage": " of Ranunculaceae and contains approximately ten species (Erst et al. 2020). Phylogenetic relationships within this genus have been elucidated recently (Xiang et al. 2021)....\nFlowers are an innovative characteristic of angiosperms, and elaborate petals usually have highly specialized structures to adapt to different living environments and pollinators. Petals of Eranthis have complex bilabiate structures with nectaries and pseudonectaries; however, the diversity of the petal micromorphology and structure is unknown. Petal development, micromorphology, structure and ultrastructure in four Eranthis species were investigated under SEM, TEM and LM. The results show that petals undergo 5 developmental stages, and accessory structure formation (stage 4) mainly determines the diversity of final mature petal morphology and pseudonectaries; the central depression formed in stage 2 will develop into nectary tissues. Petals are bilabiate and have hidden nectaries in nectary grooves; they consist of one layer of rounded and raised secretory epidermal cells and 3\u201314 layers of secretory cells with abundant plasmodesmata between cells. A large number of sieve tubes are distributed between the cells and extend to the epidermis; in addition, the vessel elements are located below the secretory area. Nectar is stored in the intercellular space between secretory parenchyma cells and escapes through microchannels or cell rupture. Pseudonectaries in all species of Eranthis except for E. hyemalis consist of smooth, ornamented epidermal cells and 9\u201312 layers of parenchyma cells with sparse cytoplasm, which may have the function of attracting pollinators.\n... & A. Grey [3]. This genus consists of 10 to 13 early flowering herbaceous perennial species that are distributed across Southern Europe and Western, Central, and temperate Asia [4][5][6][7]. Species of this genus have rarely been the subject of phytochemical research. Examination of the literature indicates that triterpene glycosides and saponins have been studied (along with their biological activity) in E. cilicica Schott & Kotschy [8,9]....\nAqueous-ethanol extracts (70%) from the leaves of Eranthis longistipitata Regel. (Ranuncu-laceae Juss.)-collected from natural populations of Kyrgyzstan-were studied by liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). There was no variation of the metabolic profiles among plants that were collected from different populations. More than 160 compounds were found in the leaves, of which 72 were identified to the class level and 58 to the individual compound level. The class of flavonoids proved to be the most widely represented (19 compounds), including six aglycones [quercetin, kaempferol, aromadendrin, 6-methoxytaxifolin, phloretin, and (+)-catechin] and mono-and diglycosides (the other 13 compounds). In the analyzed samples of E. longistipitata, 14 fatty acid-related compounds were identified, but coumarins and furochromones that were found in E. longistipitata were the most interesting result; furochromones khelloside, khellin, visnagin, and cimifugin were found in E. longistipitata for the first time. Couma-rins 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin, scoparone, fraxetin, and luvangetin and furochromones methoxsalen, 5-O-methylvisammioside, and visamminol-3\u2032-O-glucoside were detected for the first time in the genus Eranthis Salisb. For all the above compounds, the structural formulas are given. Furthermore, detailed information (with structural formulas) is provided on the diversity of chro-mones and furochromones in other representatives of Eranthis. The presence of chromones in plants of the genus Eranthis confirms its closeness to the genus Actaea L. because chromones are synthesized by normal physiological processes only in these members of the Ranunculaceae family.\nSaponins have been studied for more than four decades and their relevance is due to their numerous biological and chemical activities. Indeed, saponins are attracting attention for their industrial exploitation in connection with their pharmacological properties. Saponins also find many applications in the food industry and in the cosmetics industry due to their foaming and emulsifying property. On the other hand, depending on the type of saponin, the species that ingests it and the context, they are more or less toxic to the body. This article describes a number of investigations works carried out on saponins to determine the impact of saponins on health.\nBaikalsky State Nature Biosphere Reserve is situated in the central part of the Khamar-Daban Range (Southern Baikal, Siberia), in three administrative districts of Republic of Buryatia (i.e. Kabansky District, Dzhidinsky District and Selenginsky District), Russia. In general, this territory has been relatively well studied by botanists, but until now there was no detailed information about the flora of the Reserve with precise geographic localities. Moreover, some records in the Baikalsky Reserve's flora were published without references to documenting herbarium specimens. The dataset contains 39,238 unique occurrences of 875 taxa (854 species, 14 subspecies, five varieties and two species aggregates) from the Baikalsky Reserve and its buffer zone. All the data were acquired during the field studies by the author in 2009\u20132021, when 152 taxa (17.3% of all the taxa included into the dataset) were first recorded by the author from the study area. Herbarium vouchers are preserved in the Moscow University Herbarium (MW). This dataset is the first attempt at creating a database of vascular plants of the Baikalsky Reserve and its buffer zone, based on modern research. These data will provide the background for the updated check-list of the Baikalsky Reserve's flora.\nIAPT chromosome data 30/4. In: Marhold, K. & al. (eds.), IAPT chromosome data 30.\nThe relationships among species in the genus Eranthis Salisb. were investigated using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the nuclear DNA internal transcribed spacer 1, 2 region (nrITS) and the chloroplast trnL-trnF interspacer region (cpIS). Phylogenetic relationships based on the nrITS and cpIS were inferred with posterior probabilities with STRUCTURE analysis and the neighbor-joining method. Two major clades from nrITS and cpIS were consistent with species with yellow sepals in E. hyemalis, E. cilicica, E. longistipitata and the hybrid E. \u00d7tubergenii; and white sepals in E. sibirica, E. longituba, E. albiflora, E. stellata, E. pungdoensis, E. byunsanensis, and E. pinnatifida. The phylogenetic tree of nrITS formed more subclades than the tree of cpIS, which suggested that nrITS SNPs are useful molecular markers for phylogenetic studies in the genus Eranthis. Only the SNPs of cpIS in E. pungdoensis accessions had a deletion at positions 259\u2013420, and the posterior probability values (PPVs) assigned E. pungdoensis to population 4, which suggested that E. pungdoensis is different from E. byunsanensis. Therefore, E. byunsanensis and E. pungdoensis are considered to be true-to-type based on q-values because the PPVs were greater than 0.9 in both species based on the STRUCTURE analysis of nrITS SNPs. Significant genetic variation in E. stellata collected in Goesan-kun and Mt. Mugap, Korea indicated a potential gene flow among closely related E. byunsanensis, E. pinnatifida, E. sibirica, and E. stellata that could be due to geographic proximity in their distributions. E. stellata from Mt. Mugap showed mixed PPVs for E. stellata and E. byunsanensis, therefore, E. byunsanensis might be a possible hybrid origin for E. stellata collected from Goesan-kun and Mt. Mugap.\nThe temporal and spatial origins and evolution of the genus Eranthis have not been previously studied. We investigated the speciation and establishment histories of four Eranthis species: Eranthis byunsanensis, E. pungdoensis, E. stellata, and E. pinnatifida. The sampling localities were Korea, Japan, Jilin in China, and the area near Vladivostok in Primorskiy, Russia. We used 12 chloroplast microsatellite loci (n = 935 individuals) and two chloroplast noncoding regions (rpl16 intron, petL\u2010psbE intergenic spacer; n = 33 individuals). The genetic diversity, genetic structure, phylogenetic relationships of the four species were analyzed, and their ancestral areas were reconstructed. The high genetic diversity of the Jeju island population of E. byunsanensis and Russian populations of E. stellata indicated these species\u2019 northward and southward dispersal, respectively. The genetic structure analyses suggest that the populations in these four species have limited geographical structure, except for the Chinese E. stellata population (SCP). The phylogenetic analyses suggest that E. byunsanensis and E. pinnatifida are"

        "passage": " this Monday! Cultural lost in translation moment of the day\u2026.check! Korea, one, Lauren, zero :).\nWe ended our jaunt at Elizabeth\u2019s house. She lives 40 minutes away from me, and by then I was wayyy too tired to walk anymore \u2013 we had walked for about 4.5 hours. So I took a taxi back, and told him where to go\u2026in Korean\u2026.all by myself!! And I didn\u2019t just use one word, I used a whole sentence!! It was exhilarating. Actually, the more I hang out with foreigners here, the more encouraged I am with my Korean skills. Most of the people I\u2019ve met have been here at least a year, some two or more \u2013 and most of them can speak veryyy little Korean. Some of them can\u2019t even read the alphabet. Granted, they all live in private apartments, and their jobs are English teachers, so they obviously don\u2019t get much of an opportunity to practice much, but it\u2019s still encouraging nonetheless to see how much I actually learned in just 6 short weeks of orientation.\nSunday was equally as epic. Taking a meandering walk may not seem epic to you, but when everything is a struggle to find and ask for and understand, even the little accomplishments seem big :). On our walk, I was also struck by how much of the city I really HAVE explored. I\u2019ve been feeling very isolated and lonely and lost the past week. But as I was talking with Elizabeth and telling her what I knew of the regions of the city as we passed them, I realized that I\u2019m really not as lost as I thought I was. I told her about Metro, where there is a weekly poker game on Wednesday nights; dalk galbi is where many foreign English teachers congregate every Friday night for dinner; there\u2019s the library that has a weekly English story reading program to Korean children on Saturdays, which I\u2019m hoping to get involved in; the dance studio and Thursday night salsa club, which I still have to check out; softball or frisbee games on the University soccer fields on the weekends; free Korean language classes on Tuesday nights; the huge park that has free outdoor concerts during the summer; and of course, the English speaking church, which was the whole purpose of our walk to begin with. Talking with Elizabeth about all of these things that I\u2019ve found in the week that I\u2019ve been here reminded me that I really can do this!!! It was good to be reminded\u2026.I had almost forgotten.\nBut anyway, I was talking about how epic Sunday was!! Even though we never did find the church on our walk, it turned out to not matter. I also found a number to call to speak to someone in English for more information about the church. I called it, and it turns out it was the cell phone of like a deacon of the church, who actually offered to pick me up and drive me to church. So I gladly accepted, and by 10:30 Sunday morning I found myself weaving through the intimidating hallways of a huge Korean church to find the tiny English service. The English service is super small \u2013 not even 50 people \u2013 and most of the people who attend are actually Koreans who want to practice their English. But there were also some foreigners \u2013 mostly from South Africa, which is cool \ud83d\ude42 \u2013 and everyone, Korean and foreign alike, were really nice. It was sooo nice to be in a church again. It was very low-key \u2013 just a guitar, keyboard, and acoustic hymns. But it blessed me, nonetheless. After the service, I was talking with some of the other people, trying to get to know them. I may be an outgoing person, but since I\u2019ve been in Gyeongju I\u2019ve been putting myself out there FAR more than I normally would. It\u2019s been uncomfortable, but I feel like I need to do it now before I get stuck in a rut of isolation, so I\u2019ve been really working overtime to meet people and get involved in the things that are important to me.\nSo anyway, we were talking, and one of the girls I met, Andrea, mentioned that she was planning on going to Pohang (about a 30-minute bus ride) with her boyfriend right after church. I had been really wanting to explore the bus system, and this seemed like a perfect opportunity to do it with a guide and company, instead of having to do it by myself like I\u2019d done so many other things. So I timidly asked if I could tag along. She said yes, and off to Pohang we went! We had to take a bus to get to the main bus terminal, and then another one to Pohang. We had lunch there, and then went to a few department stores \u2013 they had to get some things for their apartments. After a few hours, we made our way back to Gyeongju and parted ways. It may not have been a huge deal; but to me it was. Getting out of the city, seeing another part of Korea, connecting with people who share my values, making a friend\u2026it was really needed. I didn\u2019t really realize how needed until it happened.\nI can\u2019t believe how blessed I am. I am so unbelievably humbled that God has allowed me to see the things I\u2019ve seen, and experience the things I\u2019ve experiences, and meet the people I\u2019ve met. My life has been a wild ride, truly incredible \u2013 and I\u2019m only 21.\nSince Sunday morning, I\u2019ve been so completely overwhelmed. In some ways, I\u2019ve been overwhelmed in a bad way \u2013 lots of Korean, and teaching, and strange foods and new experiences and unknown places. But more than anything, I\u2019ve been overwhelmed by God\u2019s provision. Last night I met up with Nia, an English teacher from California who\u2019s been here for a year. I had been talking with her on the Gyeongju Foreigners facebook group (ahh, the wonders of modern technology!), and we agreed to meet up last night so she could show me around. She took me to this great Russian restaurant, and introduced me to a few other foreigners living in the area. She showed me where the downtown area was, and the direction of the English-speaking church (to which I have since been given very exact directions, woohoo!! I\u2019m so excited about Sunday!), and showed me where a dance studio is, and told me how to find more Korean classes at the University in Gyeongju, and told me about the festivals that go on in Gyeongju, and where all the great hotspots are (both foreign and Korean), and basically made me feel so taken care of that I could cry.\nAnd she\u2019s not the only one. There\u2019s a softball game going on this weekend that another American invited me to, and she even offered to meet me by my house and take a taxi with me to the location. Someone else \u2013 another dancer, woohoo!! \u2013 sent me a message and said that if I found a place to dance to let him know, and he would gladly accompany me and be my partner. I found out that yesterday my host mother called the school and asked if someone could take me home after school, because it was raining and I hadn\u2019t brought my umbrella. The ETA who was previously at my school called me today just to check up on me and make sure that I\u2019m doing alright. My Korean co-teacher picked me up from my house and took me to school today because he didn\u2019t want me to have to walk. My host sister showed me where a stationary store was after school today so I could get supplies for my classes.  They loved that I tried to speak in Korean, and all of my students today enjoyed their class, and basically everyone was just super excited to have me there.\nThey are certainly not alone in their excitement. I love my school. ETAs are generally allowed to leave earlier than the other teachers, so I had 3 different teachers come up to me this afternoon and ask me why I hadn\u2019t left yet. It was because I didn\u2019t want to. I was having fun, and I really enjoy the atmosphere of the school. I also taught my first \u201cofficial\u201d class today! Actually, I taught 4 classes \u2013 back to back to back to back. Four straight hours of class \u2013 it was exhausting. And all of them by myself. Technically, ETAs are supposed to have a Korean co-teacher in the room with them for every class they teach, but my school could only spare a teacher for about 4 classes, so I requested that they give me more classes and don\u2019t worry about a co-teacher. And they did. And it was hard, and it was alot of work, but it was also so much fun.\nIt was also a good introduction to the Korean educational system. Korean schools are infamous for having last minute schedule changes, class switches, and failed technology. Well, I had prepared a beautiful first-day powerpoint, with pictures, and animations, and everything. I got to my classroom, only to find that the computer has not been connected yet. So, I had to improvise on the fly. Of course, if I could have my druthers, I would rather have had everything work smoothly, but I made do with what I had, the kids had fun, and I grew as a teacher. So everything worked out alright.\nWe left Goesan for Seoul bright and early Friday morning, around 5:00 am in the morning. On our way to Seoul, however, we made a detour \u2013 to the DMZ. I\u2019ve always thought that the DMZ \u2013 which stands for Demilitarized Zone \u2013 is an ironic"

But when she finally located her assumed half-sister, the woman closed the door in her face and called police.\nNow a court will rule Friday in a landmark case on Bos' demand to be officially registered as her father's child.\nIt could set a precedent offering nearly 250,000 adoptees a chance to demand legal recognition as members of their biological families -- and uncover a host of long-hidden family secrets.\nBos, now 38, was two when she was found alone at a Goesan market, south of Seoul, and 10 months later she was adopted by an American couple.\nShe rarely thought about her birth family growing up, but when her daughter turned two, it hit her \"deeply what it really meant to abandon a child at this age\".\n\"I thought about the excruciating pain my mother must have gone through to have to do this, and I wondered about the circumstances she could have been in to have to choose this painful path,\" Bos said.\nEfforts to trace her parents through adoption records proved fruitless, so she submitted a DNA sample to an online genealogy platform in 2016 and found she was related to a young Korean man studying abroad.\nThey established a relationship and worked out their common ancestor had to be his grandfather -- the only person who could tell her who her mother was.\nBut his family wanted nothing to with her, rejecting her request to meet her father.\n\"It didn't matter the countless emails I sent begging and promising secrecy and never to contact them again if I could just find out my truth,\" she said.\n\"Even when I begged on my knees out of desperation in front of his oldest daughter's door for a face to face they would not allow me, and instead called the police on me,\" she told AFP, calling her plight \"excruciatingly painful\".\nShe filed a paternity suit, a move that revealed the man's address.\nWhen she appeared at his door asking in basic Korean if he knew her face, he \"looked straight at me but then waved me off\".\nNonetheless a court-ordered DNA test showed there was a 99.987 percent probability he was her father.\n\"I just started wailing,\" Bos said. \"The truth had just set me free.\"\nBos is seeking to be included in the man's family registry, an official Korean document detailing all household members.\nIf Friday's court rules goes in her favour she will be the first South Korean adoptee so recognised, giving her a legal entitlement to an inheritance and making her eligible to apply for South Korean citizenship.\nAround 250,000 South Korean children have been adopted since the 1950s, according to Seoul's welfare ministry data, most of them overseas -- the country was once among the biggest sources for international adoption.\nAfter the Korean War it was a way to remove children, born to local mothers and American GI fathers, from a country that emphasised ethnic homogeneity.\n\nHosu Kim, a sociology professor at the City University of New York who researches South Korean birth mothers, up to 15 percent of adoptions \"point to extra-marital affairs\", with the resulting children never acknowledged.\nThe South's existing laws prioritise birth parents' privacy over adoptees' rights, and the issue is shrouded in secrecy -- many adoption files contain falsified information, or simply none.\nBos was only able to pursue her case because of the online DNA match.\nBut"

It seems to exist in a zone of freedom keeping distance from the rules and conventions of everyday life. Artists have used paintings, sculptures and carvings as a form of expression, social message, and experience.\nMuch of the architecture that we see today has derived its form from art. Art and architecture have been united by a platform where the design, designer and individual meanings are intertwined. Both are created using the same organizing principles (balance, rhythm, harmony, movement, circulation) visual elements and engagement of senses.\nArchitecture, sculpture, and painting once existed together. The closeness of the shared relationship is so unique that the subject (architecture) was predominantly taught in art schools until reclassified as science in 1958 by RIBA.\nArt needs an appropriate built environment within which it can be showcased, while architecture needs art to turn bricks, concrete and steel into a space in which people relish.\nWith the progression of the modernist movement (1860-1970), everything that did not meet the demands of structural necessity or material functionalism was deemed unnecessary and rejected.\nArchitecture discipline began to align itself with the fields of science and technology, determined by functionality and rationalism. Another contributor to the quietus was economics. The lack of art in architecture contributed to visual poverty and impersonality.\nThe aim is to design an art gallery in a public space that is open, accessible and promotes communication. The structure should be able to host new artists, where they can collaborate and exhibit their work.\nDon\u2019t be afraid to colour outside the lines and visualize bigger.\nSymbolic: Adaptation of an art piece from specific time period.\nAccessibility: Should be open and accessible to everyone.\nInteractive: Should promote discussions and public engagement.\nFlexible: Should have flexible spaces for viewing as well as exhibiting art.<|endoftext|>royal highness abbreviated hrh for his royal highness or her royal highness is a style used to address or refer to some members of royal families usually princes or princesses.\nMeghan markle will officially become a princess once she marries prince harry but her title will not be princess meghan.\nIn the royal family official titles are ultra important after all they represent rank and nobility that said queen elizabeths royal titles have changed quite a bit in her lifetime so many.\nCaroline of brandenburgansbach wilhelmina charlotte caroline 1 march 1683 20 november 1737 was queen of great britain as the wife of king george ii.\nBirth her royal highness princess maha chakri sirindhorn was born on 2nd april 1955 the third child of their majesties the king and queen of thailand.\nThe queen news and updates on her sapphire jubilee royal family and husband plus the visits speeches palaces and es from queen elizabeths reign.\n1867 oct nov his royal highness prince alfred the duke of edinburgh son of queen victoria 1881 may their royal highnesses prince albert and prince george.\nOn an official visit to spain prince and princess takamado pay a courtesy call on king juan carlos and queen sofia at la zarzuela palace photo the royal house of spain.\nWhat the queen says goesand she had been making exception after exception for her royal highness the duchess of sussex.<|endoftext|>Woke empty handed Thought I'd been stranded I know it called before but know I bland it Light up the pink strip Report to work late That doesn't...\nSo I'm not good enough to hang out with your friends You say it's a bluff, it's no lie You want to be cool and hang with both sides But what would...\nCaught in this endless trap, you neglect to see All of the aspiration built up inside of me I want to express myself and say what's on my mind You're...\n4.

I've graduated, moved in with my boyfriend, gone on holiday, started working full time and a multitude of other things, so I'm very excited to see what 2016 will bring. It'll start with a new job in January, so that's a good start! But before 2016 begins, we have to see in the new year tomorrow, and new years (especially when it comes to nail art) is all about glamour. I wanted to combine that with one of my favourite looks: tribal. If you want to learn how to create these yourself, for new years or just for fun, I've created a tutorial for Divine Caroline which you can see here.\nSuch a pretty design!!!\nThis is so gorg!\nThese look so pretty!\nWow, I like the pretty nail design and colours combination so much.

I've discussed this with multiple D-1 high school coaches in CA, namely Frank Allocco of De La Salle High School. He said that teaching the 'point the index finger to the basketball' was because it was easy for youth player to develop a great follow through. Well, for little kids, and even pros, the last finger to touch the ball is actually two fingers. For better aiming. \n\nAlso, it's just plain logic.

The Iranian vice-minister and Tonoyan inaugurated a Persian-language classroom at the main Armenian military academy at the time.\nDefense and security ties between Tehran and Yerevan seem to have grown closer since then. In June this year, another Armenian deputy defense minister, who was in charge of arms and other procurements, travelled to Iran and met with the Islamic Republic\u2019s Defense Minister Hossein Dehqan.\nDuring that trip, Lieutenant General Movses Hakobian, who was appointed as chief of the Armenian army\u2019s General Staff early this month, also held talks with the chief executive of Iran\u2019s state-run ETKA corporation that supplies food, clothing and other non-lethal items to the Iranian military. The Armenian Defense Ministry reported at the time that Movsisian reached agreements with the Iranian side on \u201con the advancement of cooperation in a number of areas.\u201d It did not elaborate.\nThe growing military contacts reflect Armenia\u2019s broader cordial relationship with Iran. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani reaffirmed his government\u2019s readiness to deepen it \u201cin all areas\u201d when he oversaw the signing in June of an Armenian-Iranian agreement on visa-free travel between the two nations. Rouhani is expected to pay an official visit to Yerevan later this year.\nIn early August, the Armenian government signaled plans to increase imports of Iranian natural gas, which currently meet up to one-fifth of the South Caucasus country\u2019s demand. It went on to announce the impending creation of a \u201cfree economic zone\u201d in Armenia\u2019s southernmost Meghri district bordering Iran.\nThere will soon be a Military confrontation with Turkey!.\nPrepere Yourselves!.<|endoftext|>So, do I need a new bathtub?\nThread: So, do I need a new bathtub?\nYes, Medicare is a federal program and Medicaid is a state. Health insurance companies typically adhere to Medicare guidelines and won't pay for anything once you cross he threshold into the bathroom. Someone at MC apparently doesn't consider bathing and pooping medically-necessary; go figure. Medicaid will, and does, pay for our commode/shower chairs, depending upon the state. I'd venture to guess that, from our experience, maybe about half the states will pay for all, or some part.\nIf not, try your states Vocational Rehab Department. Every state has one and the odds of them paying are somewhat better than Medicaid. You can find a list of state offices at: http://www.goesanywhere.com/links_and_resources.php [7th one down]. To be eligible, you need to at least ACT like you want to work.\nCommunity-based non-profit sources are the next step.\nIf you don't have any luck with any of these, we offer our customers the option of making 3 payments, interest-free, over 3 months. Typically, that amounts to under $500 for each of the 3 payments.\nOk, so it sounds like maybe I should hold off on this for just a second until the medicaid kicks in (fingers crossed..), and I see what they will be willing to pay for.\nI've also considered some type of sliding board and some lotion - over to a plastic shower chair. why not that instead of the expensive sliding ones? Not to knock them b/c they look really convenient, but.. does anyone do it this way, does it work good? He can't do transfers right now - he's just learning how to do it..But.. His arms are getting stronger every day, and I think that with my help, we could get him over the tub that way. Any thoughts on that?\nComplete safety is your friend and the best path to maximum recovery. It also best for you to preserve your strength and avoid any strains, etc. And whatever is good for you is good for him. I am glad to hear he is getting stronger.\nWhere is he in rehab? The OT and PT should be addressing this equipment and also working on tub transfer skills with him. Lotion on a slide board is a bad idea...a good way to slide right off the board and fall, and also will get greasy lotion all over him and interfere with you holding on to him to assist.\nVirtually impossible for someone without very strong triceps to do this. The person in question has a C6 SCI and is still in rehab...doubt they will be strong enough to do this when they are booted out of rehab after an average 4 week stay!!!\nThought he was a para from \"immobile from torso down\" statement...sorry.\nYeah, shortly after the lotion and sliding board idea, I had a vision of a slippery husband crashing to the floor No good, you're right. We have seen nothing of this kind of training, but he's having problems with low blood pressure every time he is up for awhile - its getting in the way of the rehabilitation at this point. Hope it works itself out soon!\nMy husband is still in a rehabilitation hospital, and I'm trying to prepare for him to return home. My main concern right now is the Bathtub. We just have a standard tub/ shower, and I wonder if there will be a way for one person (me) to help him into it, or if I really have to change it to a standing shower type with no tub. He is currently completely immobile from torso down, but his arms are getting stronger every day. I don't even think a shower chair will FIT into our tub?\nSorry that your husband was injured and now has a spinal cord injury. Is he a fellow Veteran? If so the closest VA SCI Center should be contacted. There are a lot of things that the VA will pay for ex: wheelchairs, cushions, electric beds, low air loss/alternating pressure mattress etc...\nYou can go to youtube and search for \"para\" or \"quad\" transferring and get a lot of ideas and examples.\nYour welcome. Thank you for your nice reply. I was so hoping for a lot of reasons that your husband was a fellow Veteran. If he's able to ever return back to work he should make sure he calls the local State Vocational Rehabilitation Office for an appointment to see if he's eligible for any help and retraing through Voc Rehab.<|endoftext|>Following instructions butI can't get itto work.\nRe: How do I connect my Nexbook 8 to the internet on my...\nif bought with credit card you can go back to store for a copy. nexbook can give new code.\nThe password may be on a sticker on your wireless router.

The higher it is, the better, but don't put it near metal objects.\n3.)Get as close as possible to the router with whatever device you're trying to connect.\n5.)Adjust the Wifi antenna if it has one.\n6.)Change the router's channel, especially if other wireless routers are nearby.Following these steps would give you stable internet connection and also increased speed in connection.

Select your iPad in iTunes and click Back Up Now.\nWhichever method you choose, the process will take quite some time to work depending on how much free storage you have on your iPad, your internet connection, and how Apple's servers are doing with upgrades. Occasionally, Apple will either not let you download the upgrade or it will fail. For iOS 8, you must have an iPad 3 or newer. This does not work with the original iPad - if something goes wrong, restart your device, and try again.\nI would replace the battery then, if the battery isn't removable then you could buy a used device on eBay for $30.\nTo connect to the Internet you need a few extra things aswell as a network card.<|endoftext|>I absolutely resent the fact that the mental health/illness conversation only matters when it's the \"cute symptoms\" or essentially anything non problematic\n\nNothing pisses me off more than this new wave of claiming that mental health, issues, and illness matter and we need to show the support but the minute the ugliness of it starts to creep through you're still treated just as badly as if that wave never started. \n\nI'm not here to say that personality disorders or any actual psychotic disorders are the only legitimate illnesses, but feeling constantly excluded from the conversation DOES make me feel a slight resentment towards those dealing with \"lesser issues\" or just surface level depression.\n\nThe ugliness and destructiveness of mental issues needs to be talked about in a compassionate manner.

At the 4th Organic Youth Forum, it was my honor to be one of twenty-two carefully selected foreign youths to join more than 50 local youths in Taiwan for a training and exchange on the fundamentals of organic agriculture and to forge networks and alliances that will drive the development of the organic sector in Asia.\n\u25cf CARE: Organic Agriculture should be managed in a precautionary manner to protect the health and well being of current and future generations and the environment.\n\u25cf HEALTH: Organic Agriculture should sustain and enhance the health of soil, plant, animal, human and planet as one and indivisible.\n\u25cf ECOLOGY: Organic Agriculture should be based on living ecological systems and cycles, work with them, emulate them and help sustain them.\n\u25cf FAIRNESS: Organic Agriculture should build on relationships that ensure fairness with regard to the common environment and life opportunities.\nThe president of IFOAM Asia, Dr. Zhou Zejiang, showed an entire look of organic farming development from 1.0 to 3.0. In 2017, according to FiBL survey 2019, organic agricultural land reached an all-time height with 69.8 million hectares, accounting for 1.4 percent of the organic agricultural land. Australia had the largest area of organic agricultural land (35.65 million hectares), followed by Argentina and China (3.39 and 3.02 million hectares respectively). Most of the organic producers were in Asia and Africa. However, the local markets in those areas were very small, and the organic production was mainly focus for exports. There was a strong need to strengthen the local organic markets in order to ensure a sustainable development of the organic sector worldwide.\nDr. Zhou Zejiang proposed some strategies to widely develop organic farming in Asia. Farmers should not only take advantage of good natural condition, chose local crops and animal species, but also produce non-GMO products. Apart from international markets, local market should be considered importantly as well. Whoever involving in farming should keep in mind of farmers\u2019 benefits as farmers are the bases of real organic. Moreover, government support had better to be in the forms of technology, training, organic inputs, farming tools, market exploring, organizing, etc. rather than cash only.\nI got a chance to participate in the International Conference of 2019 Organic Youth Forum on March 29th, 2019. Mr. Chia-Wei Chang, Section Head, Department of Agriculture, introduced about New Taipei City Government\u2019s Organic Farming Policies. The governments showed a high commitment to develop organic farming section in Taiwan through increasing organic value chain and global trends in sustainable agricultural products. Mr. Mathew John, Founder-Director, Keystone Foundation, shared valuable experience in order to build a Participatory Guarantee System which encouraged the development and adoption of simple and different approaches to guarantee organic produce. The forum also discussed effective ways to create diverse markets for organic products and the role of local governments & youth in organic agricultural movement.\nThe two last days of the trip, our group visited an organic tea plantation by a youth farmer and Eco-friendly farm in Yilan. The farm was initiated by a young man who wanted to protect a precious bird species by encouraging all the old farmers to change their farming practice into organic farming. Then I visited the process of the organic lunch program in New Taipei City (From the organic cutting factory, organic farms and introductions about the whole process). Finally, the group went to an indigenous tribe\u2019s farm which put emphasis on the education of food and agriculture.<|endoftext|>require 'test_helper'\n\nclass ApiCallsControllerTest < ActionController::TestCase\n  setup do\n    @api_call = api_calls(:one)\n  end\n\n  test \"should get index\" do\n    get :index\n    assert_response :success\n    assert_not_nil assigns(:api_calls)\n  end\n\n  test \"should get new\" do\n    get :new\n    assert_response :success\n  end\n\n  test \"should create api_call\" do\n    assert_difference('ApiCall.count') do\n      post :create, api_call: { doctor_id: @api_call.doctor_id, payer_id: @api_call.payer_id, payer_name: @api_call.payer_name, subscriber_dob: @api_call.subscriber_dob, subscriber_first_name: @api_call.subscriber_first_name, subscriber_id: @api_call.subscriber_id, subscriber_last_name: @api_call.subscriber_last_name }\n    end\n\n    assert_redirected_to api_call_path(assigns(:api_call))\n  end\n\n  test \"should show api_call\" do\n    get :show, id: @api_call\n    assert_response :success\n  end\n\n  test \"should get edit\" do\n    get :edit, id: @api_call\n    assert_response :success\n  end\n\n  test \"should update api_call\" do\n    put :update, id: @"

His performance this season in the NHRA Funny Car class has him going into the Summit Racing Equipment Southern Nationals on top; and during the recent break in the drag racing calendar, Capps spent time supporting his sponsor at the NAPA Expo and still found a way to keep rocking the night away.\nAt this weekend\u2019s race at Atlanta Dragway, he\u2019s ready to bring another win to his camp, but it\u2019s also the closest race to NAPA headquarters.\n\u201cThis track in Commerce is usually hot, humid and it\u2019s always been a track that\u2019s tricky and demanding,\u201d said an insightful Capps. \u201cThat\u2019s sort of what we saw at our last race in Houston and we were able to win that race. So, that\u2019s gives me a lot of confidence going to these racetracks. It\u2019s certainly put out world record numbers, without a doubt. Track records will probably fall. I think that\u2019s what makes this race so big when I look back as a kid. It was the Winternationals, the U.S. Nationals, of course and the Southern Nationals were always right there. We get a lot of NASCAR fans and racers to come over. It\u2019s close to Charlotte and we get that crowd to come out.\nCapps only has a slim six point leader over Don Schumacher Racing teammate, Matt Hagan. He has collected two wins this season in Gainesville and Houston from the first seven events with a runner-up at the season opening race at Pomona. He will be the first to tell you they are close to finding their desired consistency on the track with their new set up.\nIn the meanwhile, Capps tied Tony Pedregon in Gainesville and then with his Houston win surpassed him making him No. 2 on the all-time Funny Car win list. It\u2019s something he\u2019s still trying to wrap his head around.\nKeeping his personal momentum going Capps attended the NAPA Expo in Las Vegas for his long time sponsor and again got to share some time with his NAPA teammate, 2014 NASCAR XFinity champion, Chase Elliott.\n\u201cYeah, last week, I was at the NAPA Expo for the first time and had only heard about these events,\u201d said Capps. \u201cI feel they outdid themselves. We\u2019re talking 22,000 NAPA people for five days in Vegas. It was an unbelievable amount of people. They took over the Mandalay Bay and the Luxor hotels and they had celebrities left and right coming in. It was a week-long unbelievable event topped off with a concert put on for 17,000 NAPA people.

Credit: Image from Sentimental Journey.\n\"The strange wilderness and the majestic beauty of the Coast Mountains that surrounded our small lakeside community was overwhelming. Even the silence of nature was hard to get used to.\"\nIn 1926, the B.C. Electric Company built the Bridge River Townsite to house workers for the Bridge River Power Project. In 1932, the project was postponed and workers abandoned its frame houses, hotel, community hall, hospital, gymnasium and tennis court with only a maintenance crew left behind.\nWhen Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in December of 1941, their military also laid siege to Hong Kong where 2000 Canadian soldiers were stationed. Canada declared war on Imperial Japan and decades of prejudice against Japanese Canadians culminated in naming them \"enemy aliens\" and confiscating their fishing boats, automobiles, cameras and radios. A 100 mile \"security zone\" was delineated along the west coast from which everyone of Japanese origin was forcibly removed. Families of some means negotiated to stay together. Properties, businesses and possessions entrusted to the Custodian of Enemy Property were sold without owners' consent. The Bridge River Townsite became one of the \"self-supporting\" internment locations.\nDr. Masajiro Miyazaki was sent to Bridge River to look after the medical needs of its 270 internees. Along with a dentist Dr. Fujiwara and his family, the Miyazakis moved into the hospital building and their practices soon expanded to the local community. When Lillooet\u2019s only doctor died, the town petitioned to have Dr. Miyazaki move there. To learn more about this wonderful man, visit Miyazaki House in Lillooet. With electricity and indoor plumbing, the Bridge River Townsite was one of the more comfortable internment locations, but for Japanese Canadians, the war did not end in 1945; racist policies prevented their return to the west coast until 1949. Rationalizing that their concentration on the west coast caused widespread anti-Japanese sentiment, the Canadian government coerced them into dispersing across Canada or being deported to Japan.\nDemoralized by years of incarceration and the loss of their previous lives, businesses and properties, approximately 4,000 out of 21,000 Interned Japanese Canadians left Canada for Japan in 1946, while others went east of the Rockies and focused on rebuilding their livelihood in a new environment.\nIn the late 1970s, declassified documents revealed that the destruction of the Japanese Canadian community was purely a political measure; they were not considered to be a security threat by top military or police authorities. While Japanese Americans were similarly removed from the west coast and incarcerated, unlike in Canada, restrictions against them were eased off early in 1945.\nIn 1986, chartered accountants, Price Waterhouse Vancouver office, estimated that the loss to the Japanese Canadian community as the result of their uprooting amounted to over $400 million. In 1988, the Redress Settlement offered individual and community compensation in the amount well over $300 million.\nDuring the internment, Dr. Fujiwara and his son Alan built this miniature castle seen here on the landscaped area near by their home which is now the Bridge River Public Library. In 2011, the Bridge River Townsite was completely rebuilt, but this castle remains as a concrete reminder that equality among the races needs continuous advocacy and safeguarding.<|endoftext|>furniture repair stores furniture outlet breakfast furniture furniture store furniture stores furniture furniture furniture repair furniture repair in houston.\nleather furniture repair stores in houston upholstery near me,st furniture repair ram leather care in jaipur contact number patio stores near me,furniture repair stores in dombivli jaipur contact number myrtle beach sofa shop,furniture repair city leather kit near me sofa shop in jaipur stores,furniture repair leather shops near me stores in jaipur houston,patio furniture repair stores sofa shop in jaipur brown studio by,fix your torn or cat scratched couch with the following boom furniture repair in jaipur contact number sofa shop leather stores,furniture repair stores near me leather sofa store shops in jaipur,leather sofa repair store furniture upholstery near me stores in jaipur patio,leather furniture repair near me stores sofa store in houston.<|endoftext|>caddy.root: \"* /var/www/html\"\nnext.maraujo.rio.br.\t3600\tIN\tCNAME\tmaraujo.rio.br.\nThe A record is pointing at a private IP address, which is not available to external networks (IBM Docs).

From conversations with the team, it doesn't seem like they have a comprehensive training program that BBs and MMs offer.

Had training the street come in etc.\nYes, training is very similar if not more structured and relevant esp in the last week where the firm goes over its firms-specific protocols or modeling stratgesi.\nI'd think you would get more personalized training at a decent shop over a BB since its likely to be more personalized. A smaller shop not so much. Larger BBs have become very corporate from what I've heard.\nYes, exactly! The middle of the road shop will both ahve the resources and the specificity of protocols to help you!\nNamlaera, you have hit the nail on the donkey again...................\nI think it depends what boutique and if you are talking EB vs no name vs semi known regional.\nTraining at an EB I would assume is the exact same as a BB or MM, semi known regional (Marlin and Associates, BGL, etc.) would vary a little more but I would expect them to be solid as well, and a no name you could have zero training or the same resources as a BB or MM. Some no names don't model at all (or so I have seen on this site) and you'd be subject to learning on your own.\nI interned at a small boutique and was an analyst at another small boutique, so to answer your question it depends. During my internship we had dedicated training time across the summer with weekly sessions where me and a couple of other interns spent a few hours building a three statement model of a publicly traded company we chose with one of the associates.

Make sure youre using real bacon pieces and not imitation flavored bits. These are usually found in the salad dressing aisle and should say that theyre real bacon on the packaging. Ive also found that this bacon holds up best to the moisture from the broccoli salad.\nKeep in mind that ultimately broccoli salad is meant to be an indulgent side dish, and not health food!\nOK, I hope I didnt lose you with all of the broccoli photos!\nWhen making a pasta salad, its best to toss it in A LOT of dressing to prevent it from drying out and getting pasty. Instead of using all mayo, we add in a bit of sour cream to cut through the fat, making it less oily. You can also use yoghurt or Mexican crema.\nWHAT TYPE OF MAYONNAISE? I suggest using whole egg mayo as it tends to be less sweeter and creamier than regular mayo.VINEGAR: adds a kick of tang! You can use white vinegar, apple cider vinegar, or white wine vinegar. Substitute with lemon juice for a citrus kick.DIJON MUSTARD adds MORE flavour, making it nice and thick.MINCED GARLIC completes the flavour profile.

This sweet macaroni salad is one of the most popular macaroni salads on Allrecipes.\nThe dressing can be made up to 3 days ahead and refrigerated the pasta, vegetables, and basil can be prepared up to 1 day ahead and refrigerated. Before serving, bring all of the components to room temperature. Add the dressing to a large bowl and whisk to loosen, then stir in the pasta, vegetables and herbs. Taste and adjust seasoning and serve.\nThe dressing for this macaroni salad is my favorite! It has a bit of tang thanks to the vinegar. Plus a bit of sweetness thanks to the small amount of sugar being added. And the dijon mustard adds a wonderful flavoring.\nMix together the dressing in a small bowl and add to the cooked macaroni and add ins. You can substitute some of the mayonnaise for sour cream or greek yogurt if desired.\nIf you are storing the macaroni salad overnight or for a couple of days, you may need to mix together some more of the dressing to stir into the salad before serving. The salad will soak in a lot of the dressing as it sits over a few days.\nCook the macaroni according to the package instructions. Then drain and rinse the pasta with cold water, and transfer to a large bowl.\nMix together the mayonnaise, apple cider vinegar, sugar, hot sauce, garlic, salt, and pepper in a small dish to make the macaroni salad dressing.\nCombine the pasta and dressing. Then add the chopped roasted red peppers, kale, cooked bacon, pickle relish, and scallions.\nToss well to coat.

But it's getting late and Mark and Judy will be wondering where we are.\u201d \u201cWait!\u201d said Kristy. \u201cI think I see something black in that grove!\u201d \u201cLet's see if it's Midnight!\u201d said Julia, excitedly. We walked tired Starling and Lockjaw over to the grove and found out it was Midnight! He was having a drink from the cool brook. \u201cThank you for helping me find him!\u201d said Julia. \u201cYou're welcome,\u201d I said. Then Julia rode off to tell everyone how brave Kristy and I were. I let Starling and Lockjaw drink from the brook while I talked to Kristy.\nWhen we got back to Water Farm, Mark had just started the engine of the truck. Kristy and I quickly loaded up Starling and Lockjaw and climbed into the truck as it started moving. As the truck turned onto the highway, Judy said, \u201cCongratulations, Ashley and Kristy. You're now Dusty Lane Stable's most famous riders!\u201d Kristy and I blushed and Christina thumped me on the back. \u201cYou and Kristy were great!\u201d she said. \u201cJulia told us all about what happened today.\u201d \u201cKristy, can Christina and I also be friends with you?\u201d asked Mikayla. \u201cOkay,\u201d said Kristy. \u201cAnd so you know, my name isn't short for any other name like Christina.\u201d Christina laughed. \u201cIt would be cool if your name was,\u201d she said.\nAs soon as we got back to Dusty Lane Stables, I went inside the house and took a hot bubble bath. When I was finished, I decided to watch the DVD *Over the Hedge*. I had just then decided that my favourite character was Hammy, (the squirrel.) I loved his energy and he looked so cute! When it was over I switched to the News channel and saw a warning that Eagle's Peek had a rock slide and warning people to stay away from it. \u201cWe don't know for sure, but we do believe that some people came here on horseback and caused this to happen,\u201d said the news reporter. Then it showed a video taping of Cats and big trucks clearing away the rocks.\nChristina sat down in the computer chair and logged into Microsoft Word. We argued over what designs would be on the certificate and what it would say. Finally, I said, \u201cGuys, if we keep on arguing like this, we'll never get the certificates finished. How about we make both the certificates the same and we each get to pick two things to put on it.\u201d \u201cThat sounds like a good idea,\u201d said Mikayla. \u201cSince you came up with the idea, Ashley, you can pick first.\u201d I thought galloping horses all around the edge of it would look nice, so Christina put them on. Christina thought up the words to put on it. It said, This certificate is presented to Kristy Grant as an official member of The Country Club. And for Julia's it said, This certificate is presented to Julia West as an official member of The Country Club. Mikayla said to put a horseshoe sticker underneath the words, The Country Club.\nWell, it all came to a happy ending. Kristy doesn't bug the girls anymore and The Country Club has two new members. But the series is not over yet! There's still one more story to come, called: The Perfect Horse for Kristy. I encourage you to read The Perfect Horse For Kristy because there's also going to be bonus features. A map of Dusty Lane Stables and a map of what's around it.

The old common translation, pao cai (salted fermented vegetables), would be withdrawn.\nThe problem is that there is no Chinese character to represent the pronunciation of kimchi. As a result, the Agriculture Ministry reportedly considered some 4,000 Chinese characters before deciding on xinqi, saying it looked a bit like kimchi.\nWith this new name, the Seoul government hopes to draw a clear line between Korean kimchi and Chinese pickled vegetables, the latter being called pao cai (\u6ce1\u83dc) in China.\n\u201cWith the use of the word \u2018xinqi\u2019 for kimchi in Chinese, the ministry expects Korean kimchi and Chinese pao cai to be clearly differentiated and awareness of the traditional South Korean dish, kimchi, to be strengthened in China, \u201dthe statement said.\nThe new directive is mandated for the South Korean government and affiliated organizations. But this is only a recommendation for South Korean private companies that need to translate the word kimchi into Chinese, in addition to Chinese media discussing the Korean dish.\nNonetheless, it sparked a wave of heated debate among the media and internet users in both countries.\nWhat is the difference between kimchi and pao cai?\nBefore delving deeper into the feud, one should understand the difference between kimchi and pao cai.\nKimchi is a collective term for over 100 types of fermented vegetables in Korea, but it most commonly refers to napa cabbage fermented with seasonings, including red chili, garlic, ginger, and salted seafood.\nFermented vegetables with different ingredients like chonggak kimchi (fermented radish kimchi) or with lower spice levels like baek kimchi (unspiced white cabbage kimchi) also fall under umbrella kimchi.\nA kimchi-making festival in Goesan, South Korea on November 7, 2020.

Details on the scheme can be read here. Business ByDesign supports the financial part of the CIS process for Contractors.\nThe company/contractor needs to have the Withholding Tax Arrangements set up.\nWhen you add a subcontractor to your Supplier Base in ByDesign, there are two sections you *must* complete to ensure CIS Compliance.\nNow when you enter a supplier invoice for this supplier/SubContractor, the invoice will automatically calculate the Withholding Tax for Services Only. Materials are not subject to WHT under CIS and so no WHT is calculated.\nFrom the Tax Management Work Center, a Withholding Tax Return Run should be created for Tax Arrangement \u201cUK_WITHHOLDING\u201d. This will then provide the data that needs to be reported to HMRC.\nSAP has recently supplied another Tax Return Arrangement, \u201cGB_WITHHOLDING_NEW\u201d which you should run no later the 14 days after payment to your supplier/sub contractor.

But it is not the case in today\u2019s time. With the advent of smart projectors, carrying the device in the pocket no longer seems to be unrealistic. The best thing is that you no longer have to drape down several thousands of dollars for purchasing your favorite projector. The smart projectors cast the images of theatre quality on-screen. They are portable and come in notebook-sized packages.\nBefore buying the projector of your choice, there are many factors to be considered. Given below are some of the most crucial factors to be considered before purchasing the projector. Check out different types of portable projectors and some of the most noticeable features.\nThese devices are ultra-compact. Some of the products are not larger than the size of a smartphone. Various others resemble miniaturized multimedia devices. The pocket projectors can also be viewed as the substitute for screens that you can carry along with you. Since the products typically utilize LED lamps, thus power consumption is minimized. The brightness of pico projectors ranges in between 25 to 1500 ASI lumens and that of a decent multimedia device starts with a brightness of 2500 lumens.\nWell, this is something that represents a larger part of the category. These devices are meant for general use and utilized for various activities like preparing presentations, screening video clips, or slide shows. The equipment is considered portable and some of the models are ultra-slim. The brightness of devices ranges in between 2500 to 4500 lumens. They possess zoom lenses. But the zoom range is mostly shorter in comparison to the home theatre counterparts. The meaning of this is that special care is required to be taken while picking up the product for ensuring that screen size is compactable with the throw ratio. Many products support the interactive and also wireless presentation's functionality.\nThe home theatre projectors are unlike conventional multimedia cross overs. The devices actually run with lower brightness like on an average 1800 lumens. They possess the highest zoom capability"

The integrated study of Geoenvironmental Disasters is an emerging and composite field of research interfacing with areas traditionally within civil engineering, earth sciences, atmospheric sciences and the life sciences. It centers on the interactions within and between the Earth's ground, air and water environments, all of which are affected by climate, geological, morphological and anthropological processes; and biological and ecological cycles. Disasters are dynamic forces which can change the Earth pervasively, rapidly, or abruptly, and which can generate lasting effects on the natural and built environments. The journal publishes research papers, case studies and quick reports of recent geoenvironmental disasters, review papers and technical reports of various geoenvironmental disaster-related case studies. The focus on case studies and quick reports of recent geoenvironmental disasters helps to advance the practical understanding of geoenvironmental disasters and to inform future research priorities; they are a major component of the"

The orientations of c-axis of calcite and e twin plane were measured along with the average thickness and numbers of twins, and the widths of calcite grains. Twin strain, mean width, and intensity of twinning, and the relative magnitude and orientations of principal stresses were calculated using Calcite Strain Gauge program. Twin strain, mean width, and intensity of twinning showed ranges of 1.09-15.36%, 0.53-3.72 \u00b5m and 21.0-53.1 twim/mm, respectively. Metamorphic temperatures calculated from the twins were 170-200\u00b0C, indicating that the twins developed after the Pungchon limestone was uplifted to at least half of the maximum burial depth. Results for five of the samples indicate that the calcite twins formed during two events with principal stress axes of different orientations, while the remaining sample recorded only one event that produced calcite twins. The axis of maximum compressive stress was oriented mainly WNW-ESE to ENE-WSW, and to a lesser degree NW-SE and NE-SW. Comparison of paleostress orientations measured here and in other studies indicates that most twins were produced during the Songrim orogeny. However, the Daebo orogeny and the Bulguksa orogeny also produced calcite twins in the Punchon limestone.\nJang, B.A., 1994, The Mesozoic paleostress from healed microcracks in granites of north-eastern area of Ogcheon belt, Korea Science and Engineering Foundation, KOSEF, 57p.\nJang, B.A., Gim, J.A., 1996, Cretaceous paleostress from healed microcracks and fluid inclusions in granites from the Sogrisan and the Wolagsan area, Korea, Journal of the Geological Society of Korea, 32(3), 291-301.\nKim, J.H., Kee, W.S., Seo, S.K., 1996, Geological structures of the Yeoryang-Imgye area, northern part of Mt.

        "passage": " the solenoid, its spins nicely. Also double checked the connections up there were nice and tight.\nAround that time the mailman showed up with my new ignition switch. I installed that real quick and still nothing.\nMy gut says solenoid.\nWhat \"olliehank47 \" said.\nWell there's one sure way to confirm that, you've been saying \"arc the big posts\" but that bypasses the solenoid, to test it properly you have to bridge from the large post the battery cable is on to the smaller spade terminal that usually has the wire from the ignition switch on it.\nIf it cranks at all or even clicks loudly when doing that the solenoid is fine, if it clicks or cranks super slow there's an issue with a battery terminal, cable, ground or even inside the battery itself.\nNext time it happens the first thing I'll do is try that arc. I'll update the post for sure. Thanks everyone for your ideas!\nCheer up, you've made progress!, starter and solenoid are apparently OK as well as the battery cables, now it's time to probe the ignition switch as well as all the junctions leading up to the front and then back to the starter.\nNo, for sure, positive thoughts all the way around as im definitely narrowing it down. It's just damn peculiar- and a little worrisome that Im going to get stranded if I dont sort it out. I was gutted last OCTO, got her all shiny the day before, woke up early and nothing but dimming dash lights.\nStrange thing, a few years ago my buddy and I drove it across the country after we did a restoration on it. About a dozen time we would get something similar, wouldnt turn over except then the dash lights didnt dim. The fix was to crawl under with a pair of pliers with rubber handles and arc just the starter to get it to spin for sec. That would always fix it. Somewhere in the middle of the country, after I had my back on the nasty streets of the French Quarter in New Orleans we installed a quick push button. It hasnt done it in so long I finally took it off.\nPosted: Sat Jan 16, 2016 9:54 am Post subject: Re: Thoughts on a bus that wont turn over.\nMaybe this will help. Look at the simplified drawing, below, of the typical starter solenoid/starter motor arrangement.\nWhen you turn the key to \"start\", current flows to the solenoid and activates the pull in coil and holding coil. That causes the plunger to move back and do two things at once: 1) it moves the lever back, causing the clutch and pinion gear to engage the flywheel, and 2) the rear of the plunger makes contact with terminals B and M (in the diagram), sending power from the battery (B) directly to the motor (M).\nGenerally, if you don't hear a click, the plunger is not moving. That could be from lack of adequate power to charge the coils, from high resistance in the solenoid coils themselves, or it could be from a mechanical problem that is jamming the smooth movement of the plunger or lever.\nSometimes, you won't hear a click and the plunger is moving but the contact plate is not making good contact with the B and M terminals so adequate power is not going to the motor to cause it to turn. High resistance from the contacts, or a worn contact plate, could cause high resistance that would prevent the motor from turning--especially when under load from being connected to the flywheel--and result in a no start but with significant dimming of the dash lights. In this situation, simply jumping the terminals on the solenoid will cause the motor to turn because it is free of the flywheel.\nFinally, you may have a bad spot on the motor armature, or worn brushes. The solenoid does its job but he armature is in a position where good contact between the brushes and the armature is poor and the motor won't spin. Direct jumping may overcome that.\nIn your case, the solenoid is the most likely problem, IMO.\nPosted: Sun Jan 17, 2016 12:27 am Post subject: Re: Thoughts on a bus that wont turn over.\nOne more thing. Check your starter bushing in the transmission. If it is missing or worn the starter motor won't spin cause the armature windings are touching the magnets.\nIf you don't want to pull the motor to replace the bushing, you can purchase what's called a self supporting starter.<|endoftext|>This tax break applies to qualifying assets placed in service between September 28, 2017, and December 31, 2022 (by December 31, 2023, for certain assets with longer production periods and for aircraft).

The radon and thoron concentrations in detached houses were much higher than those in apartments. The locations of the high radon or thoron houses seem to be correlated with the concentrations of their parent nuclides in surface soil. The mean individual doses of radon and thoron were calculated to be 1.65 and 0.17 mSv y(-1), respectively.\n... In Korea, four national indoor radon surveys were conducted by the Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety (KINS) in 1988-89, 1999-2000, 2002-05 and 2008-09, respectively. The sample size was \u223c5600 dwellings and 1100 public buildings (schools and local governmental offices) (8). As a result of these surveys, a national annual average indoor radon concentration with a GM of 49 Bq m \u22123 was obtained....\n... In total 11 counties, Yeongwol, Jeongseon, Pyeongchang, Mungyeong, Bonghwa, Yeongyang, Uljin, Goesan, Danyang, Jecheon and Chungju were selected, which consists of a total of 99 townships. These counties belong to Gangwon and Chungbuk provinces where the annual indoor radon concentration showed relatively high values in the previous national radon survey (8,14). In the case of Yeongyang county, although the indoor radon concentration was relatively low in the previous survey, only one township named Subi was selected for survey because it was adjacent to the higher concentration areas in Bonghwa and Uljin counties....\n... The maximum was 2370 Bq m \u22123. Yeongwol county showed the highest GM of 120 Bq m \u22123, which is higher than that of the national annual average (49 Bq m \u22123 ) by a factor of 2.4 (8). Also, Sangdong and Jungdong township, which belong to Yeongwol county, showed the highest GM of 141 Bq m \u22123 among all the townships....\nThe objective of this study is to determine indoor radon concentrations for 11 counties in Korea, develop a detailed radon distribution map and compare the results by some factors influencing indoor radon levels. The radon survey was conducted for 7 y in provisional radon-prone areas selected based on the previous national surveys. The total number of samples was >2.5% of the entire dwellings by each county. The annual average indoor radon concentration for the survey areas had a geometric mean of 94 Bq m\u22123 with 6.6% of all sampled dwellings showing values exceeding 300 Bq m\u22123. Some areas with relatively high indoor radon concentration were identified through a spatial distribution map. Seasonal variations were observed with commonly the highest concentration in winter, and house characteristics influencing indoor radon levels. This study can serve as a basis for developing national radon action plans and guide for additional regional radon surveys.\n... About 8% of the surveyed households in Korea showed levels above the 300 Bq/m 3 recommended by the International Commission for Radiation Protection. The average radon exposure was an estimated 1.65 mSv/year [4], which contributed to approximately 36% of the average annual ionizing exposure dose in the Korean population in 2007 [5]. Since 2011, the reported concentrations of measured indoor radon ranged from 102 to 124 Bq/m 3 [6], suggesting the need for the implementation of effective residential radon control measures....\n... Although the Republic of Korea has reported indoor radon concentrations since 1989 [4], few studies have assessed its health effects in Korea [11]. Here"
