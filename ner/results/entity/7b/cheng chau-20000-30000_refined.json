        "passage": "The Skinny: While obviously a children's film, this Hong Kong animated feature has enough stuff to enlighten and charm adults. It's a bit esoteric though, and you have to wonder how much the kids really got.\nA sizable hit last Christmas, this Hong Kong animated feature is obviously targeted at children. Aside from the cute character designs, My Life as McDull comes complete with merchandising and an extensive ancillary franchise. The animation is aided by obvious computer generated backgrounds, but it retains a charming hand-drawn look that's pleasing to the tykes. McDull is an animated pig. And he's cute.\nWith all that, it's a wonder that My Life as McDull turns out to have a rather existential theme and a narrative style that would do Hideaki Anno (of Neon Genesis Evangelion) proud. Massive voice-over from an adult McDull (voiced by Jan Lam) narrates this episodic tale of young McDull's experiences with hope and disappointment as he and his mother (voiced by Sandra Ng) struggle through their low-income lives.\nMcDull was born dimwitted despite his mother's prayers for a handsome, smart son. There's no Dad around, so Mom has to make do alone. Mom continually prays for McDull's luck and life to change. However, his desires are simple. He wants to go to the Maldives. He wants a turkey dinner for Christmas. He wants things that are beyond their means.\nThey really can't afford these things, but his mother tries to please him anyway. She gets him the turkey, but the leftovers drive him crazy. Instead of the Maldives, she takes McDull to The Peak and pretends it's the Maldives. In exchange, McDull can only give into his mother's wishes and attempt to make something of himself. He decides to train to become an Olympic level athlete like Hong Kong Olympian Li San-San. However, the trade he learns is Cheng Chau Bun Catching, which involves training heavily to snatch meat buns from large towers. Huh?\nIt's actually esoteric details like these that make the movie special. My Life as McDull is steeped in a realistic, actual representation of Hong Kong, from the Peak Tram to the Wellcome grocery stores. McDull and his mother may be animated pigs, but their lives are those of working class Hong Kong residents. They visit the market and the temple regularly. Getting to Central requires a trip on the bus, and getting to Cheng Chau means taking the ferry. Landmarks (like Times Square in Causeway Bay) and streets are made to be actual. The Bun Catching thing is based on an actual festival activity that once took place in Hong Kong. It's a charming, involving effect, especially for those who either live or have visited the region.\nFurthermore, McDull's life has large metaphorical implications that are quite obvious when you stop to take a look. Despite being dim-witted and below average, McDull struggles gamely to make something of himself. He wants to be true to his mother's love and remains positive in his goals. And even if he never seems to make it, there's something inspiring in his effort. That he's an animated pig practicing bun-snatching kung-fu makes everything seem silly, but the sentiments behind it are not.\nThe stumbling block here is the self-referential storytelling that could leave most kids in the dust. Do any children out there really enjoy watching barely animated still frames with existential voiceover laid on top? The film's sentiments can prove quite charming and affecting, but when it comes out in existential voiceover, you would think that the kids would never catch it. The sounds and images speak to them, but the film's voice ultimately might not.<|endoftext|>"

This was my first trip outside of Europe and began with my first ever long-haul flight, which ran incredibly smoothly, with us all arriving from our various locations on Thursday 21st April. As I was the first to arrive I was instantly taken for my first Hong Kong food: a bread-meal with sock tea, which was lovely and refreshing after hitting the heat and humidity that knocked me as much as the jetlag, but also began my most lasting memory of HKSKH, a wonderful hospitality and generosity centred around food, tea and fellowship.\nOur time was mainly divided between two activities; travelling around the Province, meeting people and learning about life in Hong Kong and Macau; and teaching through retreats, quiet days and lectures about Franciscan Spirituality and the Religious Life. We discovered an incredibly welcoming and generous culture, full of spirituality and the love of God, with many wonderful blessings. The churches are packed with both young and old, men and women, speaking a cacophony of languages: English, Cantonese, Mandarin, Tagalog and several others.\nWe were mainly based at Ming Hua Theological College in the Central area of Victoria Island, where we lived alongside the postulants, those training for ordination, always aware of the constant nightlife opposite us in Lan Kwai Fong, the bar and clubbing district. Living alongside the postulants was a brilliant experience and helped me to experience more of the local life, being told where was good for shopping and to just sit and people watch with a cup of coffee.\nWe also spent time on Cheng Chau, an island about 30 minutes from Victoria Island and famed for its luscious mango snacks. This is where the Province keeps a small retreat house among beautiful and awe-inspiring scenery, with sea eagles flying overhead and following the fishing boats out to sea. Here we led two retreats on the life of Francis and made some delightful new friends. We also visited a wonderful<|endoftext|>"

My husband is too tired and stressed to help out. And schools and playgroups are shut.\nLast year when I was pregnant it was hell, 4 days of hell, I was crying myself to sleep at night, my toddler was giving me hell, the weatehr was rubbish, and everywhere seemed shut.\nSo, my question is, does anyone know of any playgroups or playrooms that take toddlers and/or babies for a couple of hours per day during this holiday period? I cannot handle both for 4 days by myself, my toddler cannot bear me to hold the baby and just throws tantrums all the time, I need to take them somewhere where they can play and be happy.\nI'm extremely grateful for any suggestions.....\n1) playtown. there is an advert for playtown to the right of this thread, and i believe there was a thread on playtown. your toddler would enjoy it and you could play one on one with your daughter. might be best if you went with another family so your daughter could play with another friend. entry fee is very very reasonable, $100 a child, and i think your baby would be free of charge, but i am not sure.\n3) while school is still in session, get names and numbers of mums who are in HK for the CNY and make plans to get together during the break. that's how we've survived many a time! just a change of pace, being at someones house and playing with someone else's toys makes a great time for your 2yr old.\n4) when our four were very young we used to take them walking at the top of ifc during the cold months. this was a great way to get out of the house so cabin fever didn't drive me insane, yet to give them exercise.\n5) the police officer's playground is always fun, your 2 yr old can drive a tricycle there if he or she has one.\nas for your husband being too stressed out to help, etc...there is plenty you can all do that isn't too stressful. you can go on walks along bowen road, ferry trips to outlying islands like cheng chau...what about all the stress on you?? if you explain your needs and when you need him to be involved with the family, he'll likely come around.\na combination of swapping playdates with friends who have same age kids and getting out of the home will keep you sane. hope these suggestions help.\nGo for a walk in Tai Tam Reservoir, my kids always enjoy. I agree on HK park and the Botanical gardens. I am definitely planning to meet up with other parents who are here too.\nI'll be without a helper for four days too and have no intentions of making her work during her long holiday.\nWill be here for the CNY holidays too with a toddler and nothing to do so quite happy to meet for a picnic or a day out.\nChinese New Year Activities for kids?<|endoftext|>"

For a long time I knew that Europe is too small for me.\"\nBeing part of ESN also means being a strong believer in mobility as a lifestyle. This time we move a little bit further on the globe to reach the Asian continent. Let's follow Lucie through the highlights of her adventure through Asia!\n\"Three years after my first flight to Asia, I was sitting in the plane for another flight to Hong Kong: the city of skyscrapers, international food and shopping. Luckily for me, I have a local guide, my very good friend that I met thanks to ESN buddy network \u2013 I used to be her buddy when she studied in my city. She spent days and days showing me this admirable place. I would like to point out that Hong Kong is not only a metropolitan city, but also a rare place of diverse natural landscapes. For instance, in the Lantau island you can find a Tin Tan Buddha Statue with a temple surrounded by mountains. Alternatively, you can take a ferry to Cheng Chau island and walk around the sea. If you would like to get an adrenaline rush, go to a cave which is 20 metres long and only around half a meter wide. If you are not fond of spiders, a little advice: do not look around that much.\nHong Kong it is quite close to get to Macao: the Asian version of Las Vegas. In case you would like to earn some money quickly, try to gamble in one of the many local casinos. If you want to see something other than casinos, take a bus to the Peninsula de Macao. I felt like I was in Europe because of the Portuguese influence in the past. Go to the Ruins of St. Paul\u2019s and take a picture; otherwise no one will believe that you have really been there.\nThe flight from Hong Kong to Taiwan takes only one hour and 10 minutes. This small island, located in the Pacific Ocean close to mainland China, is also known as Formosa. Whenever I try to tell others how it felt to be there, I cannot say anything else than incredible.\nTravelling around Taiwan is very convenient thanks to its size and railway system. One of my favourite places is Hualien County which is famous for the National Park Taroko Gorge. On the way to Hualien, there are mountains on the left and the ocean on the right.\nThis time we decided to visit Mukumugi Valley and got sunburnt while swimming in the river. The place is unique, because you can meet aboriginal inhabitants there. If you are in the mood for something smaller, you can go to Xiaoliuqiu island located 30 minutes from Kaoshiung by ferry. The island is just perfect for swimming. Clear water, great temperature, but the best part is watching green sea turtles eating sea plants. ESN did not leave me even in Taipei, because one morning I had a breakfast with a girl who spent a semester in my university city and she told me that she would like to come back and work there. I could not have been be happier that day, knowing that someone would like to go back to my country.\nOn my way back I had a long stopover in Dubai. I was completely alone there. Dubai is a modern city with the world\u2019s tallest building, metros without drivers and huge, I mean enormous, shopping malls with ski slopes or aquariums with sharks, too. It was hard to believe, but photos do not lie and everything is real. It is impossible to be outside when it is over 40 degrees, so you just have to spend your time walking on neverending air-conditioned paths from one metro to an entrance leading to Burj Khalifa. My trip was supposed to be an adventure, so I went outside and walked around Dubai Museum and Dubai Creek and enjoyed the temperature.\nWith this unique adventure, I decided to start my own travel blog and share my stories and advice with the rest of the world, especially those thirsty for travel and eager to discover.\"\nWhat kind of adventures have you had outside of Europe?<|endoftext|>"

They also have a fridge full of Haagen-Dazs\u2026just saying.\nThe coastal paths along Po Toi make for a gentle and easy stroll \u2013 and the views of the South China Sea are tops. Many of these trails take you by the island\u2019s ancient rock carvings which are believed to date back to the Bronze Age and are declared monuments of Hong Kong.\nPerhaps the easiest way to Po Toi from Hong Kong is to hire your own junk \u2013 or get lucky with an invite. Otherwise, a ferry service is available \u2013 but on a limited schedule.

It\u2019s a truly lovely spot to take children to let them experience the beautiful local island culture in full swing.\nCheung Chau is probably most famous for its Bun Festival, which takes place in April/May each year. The festival gets its name from the huge towers of buns erected outside the Pak Tai Temple where the main celebrations are held. The Bun Scrambling competition \u2013 which includes 9,500 buns stuck on a 14m tower \u2013 is something every child should see at least once.\nThere is sampan ferry service from the public pier (adjacent to the main ferry pier) through the harbour to Sai Wan Pier. The 10-minute ride is a great way to see the busy harbour activity, and you\u2019ll be dropped off within easy walking distance for the Tin Hau Temple and Cheung Po Tsai Cave.\nThere are a number of family-friendly beaches on Cheung Chau. We\u2019re fans of Tung Wan Beach, which is close to the ferry pier, and Pak Tso Wan Beach on the south side of the island which is bit more relaxing. And be sure to check out Cheung Po Tsai\u2019s cave where the notorious pirate is said to have stored his treasure (be sure to bring your flashlight).\nHit up the Cheung Chau Windsurfing Centre and see where it all began for Hong Kong\u2019s only gold medallist \u2013 windsurfer Lee Lai Shan. Take a family windsurfing lesson or rent stand up paddleboards \u2013 and when you\u2019re ready to call it a day, relax in their little bistro and watch the sun go down.\nBikes are perhaps the easiest way to access all the sites of Cheng Chau, and actually it\u2019s the main mode of transportation here. There are a number of bike rental stalls located a short distance from the ferry pier.\nTo get to Cheung Chau, catch the ferry from Outlying Island Ferry Pier 5 at Central Ferry Pier in Hong Kong. (The fast ferry takes 30-35 minutes). Get the ferry schedule here.\nAnother teeny island with lots to see and do, Peng Chau offers plenty of traditional Chinese character (temples, pavilions, teahouses) and a rural feel that will make Central Hong seem a million miles away. You can walk around the entire island in just over an hour (the whole island measures less than a square kilometre), making a visit here the perfect half-day adventure or even part of a full day of Hong Kong island hopping \u2013 in fact you can catch an inter-island ferry to nearby Cheung Chau from here.\nFor a pleasant walk through the village and surrounding hills, just follow the sign-posted heritage trail that leads you to a number of interesting historical and cultural buildings and sites including a picturesque Tin Hau temple built in 1792, a Qing Dynasty stone tablet, and the old Great China Match Plant, Hong Kong\u2019s largest match factory until it shut down in the 70\u2019s.\nTraditional teahouses are rarely seen these days in Hong Kong, but they can still be found here. Pop into one on Wing On Street, Peng Chau\u2019s main drag.\nPeng Chau is basically flat except for one small peak \u2013 Finger Hill. Meander up (it\u2019s all of 60 metres) and take in the panoramic views over the island, Disco Bay, Disneyland, Lamma, south Hong Kong island and across the Adamasta Channel towards Cheung Chau.\nHong Kong\u2019s outlying islands and seafood restaurants goes hand in hand, but if you want something un peu diff\u00e9rent, try Les Copains d'Aboard (\u201cfriends come first\u201d) \u2013 a little French bar and caf\u00e9 with a fab terrasse right on the town\u2019s main square.\nPeng Chau is serviced by ferries from Central Pier 6 on Hong Kong island.
