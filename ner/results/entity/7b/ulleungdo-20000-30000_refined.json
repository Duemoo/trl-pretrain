        "passage": "Geographically, Dokdo is located 87.4 km from Ulleungdo of Korea and 157.5km from the Oki Islands of Japan. Dokdo is visible to the naked eye from Ulleungdo, but not from the Oki Islands.\nHistorically, Korea has been aware of Dokdo's existence since the sixth century, whereas Japan only began to know about Dokdo from the seventeenth century. This can be confirmed through a number of Japanese historical records and old maps which acknowledge that Dokdo is not part of Japan's territory.\nFrom the standpoint of international law, the Korean Empire legally proclaimed Dokdo as its territory in Imperial Decree No. 41 (1900), stipulating that Dokdo is under the jurisdiction of Ulleungdo. Later, Japan's Shiname Prefecture illegally incorporated Dokdo into its territory by issuing Notice No. 40 (1905).\nThe \u201cEast Sea\u201d is a geographic designation Koreans have been using for over 2,000 years. Unfortunately, the widespread use of the name \"Sea of Japan\" started settling in the international community around the time of Japan's colonial rule over Korea and persists to date. This is why efforts are currently being made to internationally reinstate the geographic name \"East Sea\" for the waters where Dokdo stands.\nUnequivocally, Dokdo in the East Sea is the rightful territory of the Republic of Korea from the standpoint of geography, history, and international law.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "A team of South Korean treasure hunters has re-discovered the lost shipwreck of the Russian cruiser \u2018Dmitrii Donskoi\u2019, just off the coast of the Korean island of Ulleungdo in the Sea of Japan.\nThe sunken vessel is believed to contain almost \u00a3100 billion worth of gold bullion bars and coins, weighing approximately 200 tonnes, in around 5,500 boxes or containers.\nThe dive team comprised of experts from Korea\u2019s Shinil Group, as well as ocean salvage specialists from Britain and Canada. The discovery was made at 9:48am on Sunday 15th July at a depth of approximately 1,400 feet beneath sea level.\nThe island of Ulleungdo, situated in the Sea of Japan. Image courtesy of Google Maps.\nThe video below shows footage of the discovery by the salvage team from their two submersibles. The film shows that the hull, masts, and the stern of the Donskoi are damaged, but the upper deck remains intact and the hull is also well preserved. The video also shows the ship\u2019s anchors and machine guns still in place.\nThe Shinil Group has said it will take several months to orchestrate salvage work and raise the wreck, estimating that the ship would be raised in October or November this year.\nThe group plans to give half of the recovered gold back to the Russian government, and then give 10% of the remaining half (\u00a34.985 million) to the island of Ulleungdo for tourism purposes, including a museum dedicated to the ship.\nThe Shinil Group who discovered the wreckage initially stated that they were the first team to find the Dmitrii Donskoi, but this has since been proven incorrect by the Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology (KIOST).\nThe government-funded team found the wreckage in 2003 but failed to raise it. Their discovery was reported by Korean and regional media organisations and the public can still see the photographs the team took from their dives 15 years ago.\nThis previous discovery could jeopardise the latest team\u2019s claim to the salvage, as they wouldn\u2019t be the only right holders to the wreckage, but KIOST also claim that the Shinil Group found the Donskoi through unauthorised use of information that was the intellectual property of the institute.\nThere are further obstacles for the Korean treasure hunters to overcome too. The Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries has told BBC Korea that the Shinil Group has not yet applied for salvage rights and were it to do so it would owe 10% of the salvage value to the Korean government.\nEven if the Shinil Group and their associates from Britain and Canada ARE successful in getting permission and being the sole rights holders for the salvage, some experts are saying that the ship couldn\u2019t physically hold 200 tonnes of gold as well as the crew, rations, and munitions, while others question why the Donskoi would even hold that much gold in the first place given the easier travel arrangement of gold bullion to go by train to the port of Vladivostok.\nDmitrii Donskoi in New York Harbour on Thursday April 27th, 1893 on a goodwill visit coinciding with the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America by Columbus. Photo courtesy of Wikipedia and the Creative Commons license.\nThe Dmitrii Donskoi (\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0414\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439) was a first-class ironclad Russian cruiser named after the Grand Duke of Moscow. It was built in 1885 and weighed 5,800 tonnes. It served for 20 years in the Russian Baltic Fleet and was used in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905 to protect slower transport ships.\nThe ship was taking part in the Battle of Tsushima when it was separated from the rest of the Russian Fleet in low light. The ship\u2019s captain elected to make a break for it, choosing to race north towards Vladivostok, through the Japanese fleet. The first attack by the Japanese was unsuccessful in damaging the cruiser but later in the night it was spotted again and suffered critical damage, with 60 of the 591 crew members killed in the firefight and a further 120 injured.\nCaptain Lebedev elected to weigh anchor at Ulleungdo for the night and disembark, before scuttling the ship the next day on May 29th, 1905. It is believed this was done so that its cargo \u2013 the alleged gold hoard \u2013 would not fall into Japanese hands. The team from the Shinil Group claim that this vast wealth was the wages for the entire Russian navy.\nTo read the official press release given by the Shinil Group to PR Newswire, click here.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " visit in Korea this season.\nAutumn foliage is beautiful viewed from the ground, but imagine getting a complete 360 degree view from above.\nDanyang is a popular destination in Korea for paragliding, as the mild weather and ideal geographic conditions provide the ultimate paragliding experience almost 300 days out of the year. The experience is particularly stunning during the autumn months, when the surrounding mountains take on shades of warm orange and gold.\nYou do not need any prior experience with paragliding. Professionals will guide you each step of the way, from registration to driving up the mountain to takeoff and landing. There is even a video recording option, in which you can receive a video at the end of the journey of the entire 11 minute flight. It\u2019s a fun keepsake to remember your time in Korea!\nWhile you are in Danyang, try some dishes with garlic, as garlic is a local specialty.  If you are not a fan of chicken, you can also find garlic tteokgalbi (beef) and garlic dumplings.\nLocated just an hour away from Seoul, Chuncheon is a city located in the beautiful natural retreat of Gangwon Province. Home to many lakes and mountains, the city is a popular destination for outdoor activities even for locals. While there are plenty of options to choose from, one activity we recommend is canoeing on Chuncheon Mulle-gil.\nChuncheon was the first place in Korea to introduce wooden canoes. The owner first encountered canoes while studying abroad in Canada, and to his disappointment, he found they were not widely known in Korea. He decided to change that and began making his own wooden canoes and in 2011, Chuncheon Mulle-gil was opened.\nChucheon Mulle-gil soon gained even more recognition after appearing in popular Korean TV Shows including \u201cTwo Days, One Night\u201d and \u201cRunning Man\u201d. There are a total of three courses available, as well as a range of programs for different skill levels and group sizes. It is a fun teambuilding activity for groups, allowing members to spend time together while taking in the beautiful natural scenery of Korea.\nAfter a long day of canoeing, satisfy your appetite by visiting Chuncheon Myeongdong Dakgalbi Street for a taste of the city\u2019s specialty food \u2013 Dakgalbi. Dakgalbi, or spicy stir-fried chicken, is a mouthwatering dish made by stir-frying a combination of sweet potatoes, cabbage, scallions, rice cakes and diced chicken marinated in a spicy gochujang sauce. You can even fry rice in the remaining sauce for a delicious end to your meal. Typically served in a large skillet in the middle of the table, it is a fantastic dish to share as a group.\nTIP: On weekends, special sunset canoe tours are available. Rowing through the lake during sunset is an experience not to be missed.\nMany people are probably familiar with the island of Jeju, but there is another island off the east coast of mainland Korea that is often overlooked but definitely worth a visit.\nUlleungdo offers a taste of island life that is more authentic and closer to nature than the more industrialized Jeju or the mainland. Perhaps that is one of the reasons why the island is often tagged with the labels \u2018mysterious\u2019 or \u2018spiritual\u2019. The unobstructed natural scenery is unlike what you will find in other parts of Korea. Boasting plenty of ocean views, sweeping mountains and beautiful sunsets, a visit to Ulleungdo will offer a healing, immersive experience in the great outdoors.\nThe best way to explore Ulleungdo is by foot or bike to take in the natural beauty up close, and the island offers both walking and biking trails that will put your right along the coastline, with views of the crashing waves below and the lush mountain ranges. A walk along the Haengnam Coastal Walking Path will bring you to the Dodong Lighthouse, where you can get a beautiful view of the surrounding oceans and even see out to Dokdo on a clear day.\nAfter exploring the island, be sure to taste some of the local specialties. Fresh seafood is in abundance, and the island is especially known for their grilled squid. For those that prefer meat over seafood, the island is also famous for its special bulgogi (roast beef) made from cows that graze on the island\u2019s herbs. The special diet of medicinal herbs results in a fragrant and flavorful meat that is unique to the island.\nWhat\u2019s great about visiting Gyeongju in autumn is the wide variety of sights. If you head over to the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site Bulguksa Temple, you will find the ancient temple surrounded by golden autumn leaves. If you head over to the area around Cheomseongdae Observatory, you will find endless fields of pink muhly, providing the perfect backdrop for photos. Or head over to the Bomun Lake Complex for a leisurely walk or bike ride around the lake.\nAs Gyeongju is a popular tourist destination, you can easily find small shops renting out bicycles, tandem bikes, and scooters. Hop on a bike, feel the crisp autumn breeze and enjoy the clear blue skies and colorful sights of Gyeongju\u2019s autumn.\nWith a recent boom in trendy cafes and restaurants in the Hwangridangilarea, there is no shortage of places to grab a bite, but be sure to try the Hwangnam-ppang, a local specialty. Many shops in Gyeongju sell the small sweet pastries filled with red bean paste. They are sold in gift boxes as well so be sure to pick up a few on your way home!\nDid you know, you can walk all the way around the island of Jeju? The Jeju Olle Trails are a set of 26 routes, consisting of 21 main routes and five sub-routes. The trails connect to make its way around the entire island, plus a few small surrounding islands. Trails range in difficulty from low to high, and durations range from one hour all the way up to eight hours. The routes offer an opportunity to observe the landscapes and seaside views of the island from up close, and each trail offers a unique experience. You can even get a passport where you can receive stamps for every trail you complete.\nFall is a great time to hike the trails, as the sun can be quite brutal when walking during the summer months. In the fall, the temperature is mild and perfect for a leisurely walk. In fact, Jeju Island hosts an Olle Walking Festival each year in the fall, and during festival time, you can spot long rows of people making their way along the trail together. It makes a great teambuilding activity. After your walk, be sure to fill up with some of Jeju\u2019s delicious fresh seafood!<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " buy our tickets and hotel for this trip, and holy did it make it easier. We told them about the ferry tickets we wanted on Kakao, then they found and purchased everything. We paid them and got our ferry tickets in the chat. Same with the hotel \u2013 most hotels on Ulleungdo don\u2019t have websites so it means you\u2019d need to call. We basically told Ask Ajumma what we wanted and when. Then they got back us with options and we chose and paid. Even at the hotel when there was confusion with the check-in counter they called in and sorted everything out for us. It felt pretty good having concierge at our fingertip when we were on the go. Honestly, we\u2019ve used it a few other times and really recommend it for travelling Korea. Their Kakao ID is \u2018askajumma\u2019 if you\u2019re interested.\nA problem (or a blessing) with getting to Ulleungdo is the total absence of an airport. One must take a ferry from 1 of 3 ports on Korea\u2019s east coast. You can depart from Mukho, Pohang or Gangneung. Be sure to get your ticket in advanced if possible, since it\u2019s a hot item in travel season. The ferries were nice and modern. We had a window seat on the way there from Pohang, though we were boxed in by an ajumma/ajoshi party on the floor next to us. The older group hung out and drank the trip away despite attempts by the ferry staff to stop it. The ferry had a little snack bar with various Korean snack and ramen. As for the smoothness \u2013 the trip from Pohang went off without a hitch. You could barely feel it rocking. The way back to Mukho, however, was a different story! It was rocking pretty good and we had the sounds of seasickness all around us. So I\u2019d recommend the anti-sickness medicine on sale at the departure terminals if you have a weak stomach. Just ask for \uba40\ubbf8, pronounced mol-me, at the counter and you\u2019ll be all set! All the ferry contact info was on the map we got on the island. It\u2019s really useful so here\u2019s a photo of it if you need ferry times, prices and phone numbers. We found it had more information that we could find on the Ulleungdo travel site.\nThe first thing you need to do once you arrive at the island is find the tourism information booth and get your bus schedule and island map. My girlfriend and I found them extremely useful throughout the trip. After you walk off the terminal bridge turn left towards the police station and there\u2019s a tiny little booth giving out free maps and schedules to get started. Everything we did was done with either bus or taxi. Note, it was really difficult to get a taxi on the far side of the island, and we were once left waiting a couple of hours for a bus.\nThis one is a must. It was pictures of this walking trail that sealed the deal on Ulleungdo. A walkway has been laid around the rocky cliff shoreline between Dodong and Jeodong, allowing people to experience a landscape that was previously totally off limits. Blue water, black rocks, huge cliffs \u2013 this place is a great hike. For an added bonus, check it out at night for a view of the squid boats on the horizon, and listen to nothing but ocean waves.\nUlleungdo has numerous annual festivals, and some impromptu ones \u2013 which we were lucky to stumble onto. All the tourists turned out for the Dokdo Sovereignty concert to watch. Complete with pyrotechnics, kpop stars, and adorable performing children. There\u2019s even a famous squid festival where you can catch a squid with your bare hands (if that\u2019s your thing).\nAt the end of the bus line in Jeodong you can walk up to a beautiful waterfall where most of the community gets its drinking water from. It was SCORCHING hot when we went but a nice man selling photos up there offered to take our photo for free. He was full of photo ideas, that\u2019s for sure\u2026 Afterwards on the way down you pass a wind cave, where highly cooled air from underground jets out of a hole in the rocks to create an extremely cold cave to cool off. It was great after being outside in heatwave temperatures. People were napping inside and cooling their water bottles, too. The funny thing is in Korean it\u2019s literally referred to as Air Conditioning.\nThe Dokdo observatory is situated on top of a mountain peak that overlooks Dodong Harbour and is reached by a cable car a short walk from Dodong. It was still way too hot when we went up, but we made it to the 2 separate lookouts for some sweet photos of the town and island. It was too hazy to see Dokdo on our day, but the hikes and views were nice nonetheless. And who did we run into on top of this mountain lookout? The freakin\u2019 ajumma/ajoshi party from our ferry ride in. They were better this time and it was funny to recognize each other again and try to talk to each other.\nDepending on your location and transport options, it this could be a difficult one. Our hotel was in Jeodong and a short walk to the Haengnam walkway so we chose that spot. There are several other sunrise locations on the island though. Most would either require a car, a campout or an extremely early morning hike. We managed some great photos and it was incredibly peaceful.\nUlleungdo is one large volcanic relic.  The highest point in Seonginbong at 984 metres. From there you get a spectacular view of the entire island and the Nari Basin \u2013 the only flat land on the whole island. There are a few recommended routes by the Korean tourism site. I recommend the KBS relay station as a starting point. We had told our taxi driver to take us to the foot of Daewonsa Temple but he said it was too steep and suggested we go to the KBS starting point. It was definitely a better choice, as we climbed at least 100 m in the car before going out a foot. It was a welcome reduction in the hike given how hot it was. From Jeodon it was only 10,000W to the KBS Relay station. We hiked down into the Nari Basin on the way down, and effectively crossed the island on foot. From the basin there is a bus to Chunbu or you could walk. Be sure to check out the traditional houses scattered in the basin while you\u2019re there, too!\nAfter we caught our bus out of the Nari Basin, we found ourselves in Cheonbu \u2013 the bus terminal point of the far side of the island. Nearby people were swimming and there was an underwater observatory. It was a building at the end of a long pier with an elevator that took you 6 metres under the under to watch hundreds of fish and sea creatures swimming on by. It was actually pretty cool and no one was in the ticket booth on the day we went so it was also free!\n9. Go Swimming!\nUlleungdo is an island. It might not be filled with white sand beaches, or even and sandy beaches, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t find a beautiful spot to cool off. We swam at a few different locations, and each one had breathtaking scenery. Rocks jutted out of the ocean and were surrounded by cliffs on all sides, with very few people to spoil it. The downside of these beaches is their composition \u2013 they are mostly made of large rounded pebbles that are hard to walk on and a little slippery. We did find one beach that was very small pebbles that didn\u2019t hurt your feet.\nThere was a great beach near the village of Tonggumi and Gajaegul-bawi. It had the small rocks which were easy to step on, and was enclosed by two enormous rocks on either side, creating a secluded feeling. Around us were some other families, diving classes, and people diving for seafood. Highly recommend!\nAnother beach was near Gwaneumdo Island. We ended up waiting for a couple hours for a bus and decided to go for a dip. The rocks were clean and the water was so warm! To get to the water, you need to walk behind the building and you\u2019ll see an old staircase leading down to the shoreline. It\u2019s a great spot if you have time to kill, there\u2019s shade, bathrooms, and food trucks.\nThere is a list of boat tours available on the map. The most popular trip travels around the entire island in about 2 hours, showing the stunning rock formations. You can buy tickets for it from a ticket booth just outside the main Dodong ferry terminal. It turns out when we went that the ship was undergoing maintenance and wasn\u2019t doing tours! We had an idea though and caught a ferry from Jeodong port to Gwaneumdo. For 4,000W each it took us towards the recently opened Gwaneumdo island. On the 30 minute boat ride we saw some great views of Ulleungdo and even nicer parts of Gwaneumdo. This included a pirate cave which was thought to be a refuge for pirates back in the day. And everyone feeds the seagulls on the boat! People came with snacks and held them up off the back of the boat. Seagulls would swoop in and snag them from your hand. A friendly korean person offered us some snacks to feed the birds with, which is more fun than it looks. I really recommend doing some<|endoftext|>"

The flame has already gone through Ulleungdo, Baengnyeongdo and Jejudo islands and has now arrived on the mainland. The torch relay will continue along its course and arrive at the main stadium in Incheon for the opening ceremony on September 19. The \"Light of Peace\" will stay lit throughout the games.\nOn August 14, the flame arrived on Baeknyeongdo Island, the northernmost South Korean island in the Yellow Sea. A total of 106 fishing boats sounded their klaxons to greet the flame. Some 55 participants consisting of residents, marines and students ran a 3.4 kilometer relay. They ran hoping for peace and the reunification of the Korean Peninsula. Then the flame left the island and headed to Jejudo Island via airplane.\nThe flame arrived on Jejudo Island and traveled a total of 4.8 kilometers, divided into 16 sections. Female divers, police officers on horseback, disabled people and boys and girls who are already heads of their own households, as well as foreign residents, all took part in the relay, taking in the beautiful scenery of the island.\nThe flame arrived on Uleungdo Island on August 18. Five torch bearers, including residents, athletes and students, ran 2.5 kilometers, divided into five sections. Residents welcomed the arrival of the torch despite bad weather and showed their support for the upcoming Asian Games.\n\"Incheon is far away from Ulleungdo Island, but I wanted to contribute to the Asian Games and so I applied,\" said Kim Min-gu, a student. \"I am glad to become a torch bearer and I hope that the Incheon games will be successful.\"\nThe torch left the island and arrived in Gyeongju, Gyeongsangbuk-do (North Gyeongsang Province), the next day on August 19. Torch bearers ran 1.5 kilometers in Gyeongju. Some 41 participants ran along eight sections around the city and arrived in front of Gyeongju City Hall.\nSix foreign residents took part in the relay for the Asian Games, representing a continent of 4.5 billion people. There were welcoming ceremonies, such as a b-boy dance performance, musical performances that were a fusion of traditional Korean music and modern pop music, and a boys and girls choir performance. There was also asamulnori performance of the traditional percussion quartet.\nThe flame later arrived in Ulsan on August 19. Torch bearers ran from the Ulsan Culture Art Center to Ulsan City Hall, a total of 1.6 kilometers, divided into 13 sections. Ulsan residents waved and applauded, hoping for a successful hosting of the games. The torch bearers ran to cultural spots across the city to entertain the spectators. The flame arrived at Ulsan City Hall and there was a traditional dance performance by the Ulsan municipal dance company.\n\"The gathering of the flame atop Manisan Mountain, a sacred place for the Korean people, is to wish for a successful hosting of the games and to hope for peace,\" said an organizing committee official. \"Now it is united with the flame from New Delhi and it will be lit throughout the games.\"<|endoftext|>"

Also, those gridlines and the shape of Ulleungdo make me wonder how Seoul National University dated THIS MAP, which is believed to have been made sometime between 1750 and 1768.\nMaybe, someone should go back and reevaluate some of these maps?\nActually, this map is a little confusing for me since the name \u8d8a\u677e (Weolsong) comes just before \u9b31\u9675\u5cf6\u9577 (Ulleungdo-Jang) on the map, which suggests that the Ulleungdo-Jang was from Weolsong. If that is true, then the map should be dated from 1888 to 1894.\nI am not exactly sure how to interpret all the writing, so I think more study is needed.\nI especially interested in the \"1859-65.19C\u4e2d\u671f\u3000\u6771\u8f3f\u3000\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6 \uff08\u5199\u672c\uff09\" which Korean National Central Museum (\u97d3\u56fd\u56fd\u7acb\u4e2d\u592e\u535a\u7269\u9928) owns.\nIt also has gridline but the picture is somewhat blurred.\nTha map was made in Japan but the information was brought by Kim Okgyun (\u91d1\u7389\u5747, \uae40\uc625\uade0), the Korean reformist. The map showed the Argonaut island as Takeshima and Ullengdo (Dagelet) as Matsushima. There is no mentioning of Liancourt rocks. So this map means that one of the intellectual Koreans in those days who once worked in Ulleungdo didn't know about Liancourt rocks.\nKim Ok-gyun was not only a Korean intellectual; he was the man in charge of moving settlers to Ulleungdo until he had to flee Korea in 1884, which means he should have known better than anyone the situation on Ulleungdo in 1884. And since his map did not show Liancourt Rocks, we can assume that he either did not know of the rocks or did not consider them to be a part of Korean territory.\nYes, I read Aki's post, which was very good.\nFor example, the 1865 map which was made in Paris indicated Ousan precisely just next to Ulleungdo.\nI saw some German-made maps of Korea which were made in 1892, 1894 & 1897.\nAll these maps are very accurate, as they show Ulleungdo as \"Matsushima (Dagelet I.)\" and Liancourt rocks as \"Liancourt Rocks (Hornet rocks)\", and they don't include the ghost island of Argonaut.\nAdditionally, all these maps coloured both \"Matsushima (Dagelet I)\" and \"Liancourt rocks (Hornet rocks)\" as the same colour as Japan.\nIt seems that western countries in those days recognised as Ulleungdo as Japanese territory, although this was not true, but which may mean that there is no chance for Korea to claim that Liancourt rocks to be their territory.\nP.S. I got a few of these maps from e-Bay recently.\nInteresting maps, Pacifist. I have bookmarked that page.\nI think we have already talked about one of the maps HERE.\nBy the way, did you see the maps on the link that Kaneganese told us about HERE?\nYes, I saw some of the maps in the site (of Alabama Univ) and noticed that although American maps usually conveyed Argonaut I (as Take I.) until early 20th century (1902-1903), German maps (printed in Leipzig) excluded Argonaut I even in 1890's.\nP.S. Some maps can be seen too in the following Texas site, although not so many.\nTo follow is American-made map of Korea. It doesn't include Liancourt rocks, although it includes Ulleungdo.\n\"I am not exactly sure how to interpret all the writing, so I think more study is needed.\"\nI couldn't really understand what you are trying to say\u3000(Sorry...), but if you are not so sure about the year when the map was made right now, maybe the title sould be written as \"1884 - 1888?.... \" in order to avoid any confusion for the readers at least until you become sure about it? I think it would be more friendly to the readers. Not everyone read comment section. But posting your ideas and findings itself is great since it would give us a chance to study more about the map, and hopefully, someone gives us more information about it.\nGood idea, Kaneganese, but I think I will put \"1884 - 1994\" without a question mark since I am pretty sure of that date.\nAnyway, what I was trying to say was that if the \"Ulleungdo-Jang\" (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6\u9577) was the \"Manho\" (\u842c\u6236) out of Weolsong-jin (\u8d8a\u677e\u93ad), then that would mean the map could be dated between 1888 and 1895 since that was the time the Weolsong-jin Manho was Ulleungdo-Jang.\nBetween 1884 and 1888, the Camp Commander at Samcheok replaced the Ulleungdo-Jang, but was called \"Ulleungdo Cheomsa,\" instead.\nIf you look at the writing on the map, you will see that \"Weolsong\" (\u8d8a\u677e) is written just before, which would suggest he was out of Weolsong, but in small letters next to \"Ulleungdo-Jang\" (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6\u9577) is written \"Pyeonghae, Samcheok-po Jin\" (\u5e73\u6d77\u4e09\u4e09\u965f\u6d66\u93ad), which suggests he was out of Samcheok-po Jin. Do you see my confusion now?\nThe fact that Ulleungdo appeared on the Samcheok map makes me believe that the map was made when the Ulleungdo-Jang was the Samcheok commander, which was between 1884 and 1888. The only problem with that is that he was not called \"Ulleungdo-Jang,\" but was called \"Ulleungdo Cheomsa.\" However, I am thinking that \"Ulleungdo-Jang\" could have been his unofficial title since he replace the previous Ulleungdo-Jang.\nYes, I know it is a little confusing.\nAt any rate, I think we can safely say the map was made between 1884 and 1894. I stopped it at 1894, instead of 1895, because that was the upper limit for the map given by Koryo University, who probably had a good reason for dating it up to 1894.\nSo, I think this means this was the last Korean map of Ulleungdo made before the 1900 Imperial Edict that made Ulleungdo and her neighboring islands a county of Gangwon Province. Of course, it is possible that U Yong-jeong (\u79b9\u7528\u9f0e) made a map of Ulleungdo that we do not know about since he inspected the island in 1900, before the edict was proclaimed.\nI got it finally. Besides, as long as \"\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6\u9577\" is listed, it is highly unlikely to be made 1700's, in the first place, right?\n\"I think I will put \"1884 - 1994\" without a question mark since I am pretty sure of that date.\"\nYou mean \"1884 - 1894\"? As long as you are sure about it, yes, it's good. Anyway, good find, Gerry. By the way, isn't it possible to send some question to Koryo University to ask how they defined the year of the map was made, like Shimane prefecture site?\nI'm not sure if this non-official map has anything to do with 1900 Imperial Edict or not, but the text on the map does include some new information on Usando and Ulleungdo, so it is a very important for us. I really hope Korean make all the documents \u79b9\u7528\u9f0e supposed to submit to Korean government public.\nYes, I meant 1884 to 1894. Sorry.\nIf Koryo University dated the map between 1835 and 1894, then that means they do not know the date of the map.\nKorean maps are usually dated by the name change of some village or mountain that is recorded in Korean records. If the map reflects that change, or does not reflect it, then scholars can use that to narrow down the date of Korean maps. In the case of this map, the person looking at it obviously overlooked the mention of \"Ulleungdo-Jang\" (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6\u9577) because that is a clear indicator that the map was made after 1883.\nI guess there is someone at Koryo University who may know about this map, but I think we now know more about it than he or she does. Even the Dokdo Museum could only date<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " with both staking claim to the island. In 1905 Japan incorporated the island into its territory by claiming that it was terra nullius (land belonging to no one). Korea was a Japanese protectorate at the time and in no position to object.\nAfter World War II, the San Francisco Peace Treaty of 1952 explicitly gave Korea control of Jeju, Ulleungdo and Geommun-do, but Dokdo was left out of the agreement completely and the islands have been under de facto Korean control ever since. To this day, Japan continues to claim their sovereignty which proves to be a very sore point in Japan-Korea relations.\nAccess to visitors was limited until Japan's Shimane prefecture declared a \"Takeshima Day\", inflaming the already volatile situation. The Korean government responded by opening the island up to tourists on March 24, 2005. Since then, an average of 80,000 visitors visit the island every year.\nA fisherman by trade, Kim Sung-Do and his wife Kim Shin-Yeol are the only permanent residents on the island. There are also a small dispatch of security police officers, representatives from the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries and three lighthouse keepers who reside there on rotation.\nJapanese citizens should check in advance before attempting to travel to Dokdo. All other nationalities should have no issue.\nQuestions (in Korean) can be directed to the Ulleungdo and Dokdo Administrative Office under the telephone number |||PHONE_NUMBER||| ~6.\nTo get to Dokdo, you must first get to Ulleungdo. There is only one charter company that has boats ferrying you to and fro. The Dae-A-Express has two ports, Pohang in North Gyeongsang-do and Mukho in Gangwon-do. From Pohang, it takes about three hours to get to Ulleungdo from the mainland. It takes a little less time from Mukho, about two and a half hours. The boats leave once a day. From Pohang the ticket fare is \u20a958,000. From Mukho it's a little cheaper at \u20a949,000.\nThe Dae-A-Express and the Tour and Shipping Company [dead link] operate ferries to Dokdo. There are three boats that leave daily. However the ferry schedule is subject to frequent changes. So it is advisable to reserve seats to Dokdo before reserving them to Ulleungdo. Prices range from \u20a942,000 to \u20a945,000.\nThe island is tiny, and you can access everything by foot.\nDokdo is an important part of modern Korean national identity, but doesn't actually have much, if anything, to offer foreign tourists. If you like the idea of a long and bumpy sea trip followed by views of an interesting rocky outcrop then it may be for you, but be aware it is a rather niche destination generally.\nThe small island is mainly volcanic rock with patches of lush grass. The two islets that make up Dokdo, each have their own particular features. Seodo (West islet), the smaller of the two, is where the fisherman and his wife live. Their house is at the bottom of the steep cliffs. Dongdo (East islet) has a large crater at the top that runs right to the water. The other highlight is the \"Hyeongje\" Cave. It is also where the security officers are stationed. Between the two is another cave, the \"Cheonjang-gul\".\nBecause the warm and cool currents converge in the surrounding area, a great variety of fish thrive there. Also Dokdo is home to a multitude of birds. One of the reasons the island was closed off to the public was to preserve the natural ecology. Dokdo meaning is rock island and alone island.\nTypically you would have just 20 minutes to look around, so just some limited walking is possible.\nSince the island is so far from the mainland, the weather can get extremely erratic and at times the boats will not run because sea storms or choppy water. It is prudent to call ahead of time.\nMany Koreans are concerned about the possibility of a military attack by Japan in order to reclaim the islands. Whilst Japan does indeed contend the ownership of the islands very strongly, any suggestion of military action is extremely farfetched.\nThe three main South Korean Telecom Providers (KT, SK and LG) offer fast LTE internet connectivity over their mobile phone networks, with dedicated base stations on the rocks.\nOn the same boat back to the island of Ulleungdo.\nThis city travel guide to Dokdo is a usable article. It has information on how to get there and on restaurants and hotels.

Though Japanese in the Edo era had been clearly aware of the locations of Takeshima (\u7af9\u5cf6 = today's Ulleungdo) and Matsushima (\u677e\u5cf6 = today's Takeshima/Liancourt Rocks/Dokdo), the non-existent island on Western maps called \"Argonaut\" and the turmoil in the Japanese government following the fall of the Edo Shogunate caused confusion and debate on the names and locations of islands in the Sea of Japan between Japan and Korea. See HERE.\nIn order to resolve these questions, Foreign Minister Terajima Munenori (\u5bfa\u5cf6\u5b97\u5247) finally ordered an on-site survey of Ulleungdo in 1880 (\u660e\u6cbb\u5341\u4e09\u5e74) and dispatched the warship Amagi to the Ulleungdo area to clear up the name confusion concerning the islands in the region. The Amagi discovered that \"Matsushima\" (\u677e\u5cf6) was actually Ulleungdo and \"Takeshima\" (\u7af9\u5cf6) was a small island off the northern shore of Ulleungdo, which Koreans pronounce as Jukdo (\u7af9\u5dbc). The map made during the survey confirms that Takeshima was Ulleungdo's neighboring island of Jukdo (\u7af9\u5cf6).\nKitazawa Masanari (\u5317\u6fa4\u6b63\u8aa0) wrote an account of this survey in the Takeshima Kosho (\u7af9\u5cf6\u8003\u8a3c - \"A Study of Takeshima\"). In his account, he concluded that Matsushima was Ulleungdo and confirmed that both Ulleungdo and the island he called Takeshima, which was Ulleungdo's neighboring island of Jukdo<|endoftext|>"

Epub 2020 Sep 23.\nDepartment of Biology Education, Chonnam National University, Gwangju 61186, Korea.\nJeju Island is located at a marginal edge of the distributional range of East Asian evergreen broad-leaved forests. The low genetic diversity of such edge populations is predicted to have resulted from genetic drift and reduced gene flow when compared to core populations. To test this hypothesis, we examined the levels of genetic diversity of marginal-edge populations of, restricted to a few habitats on Jeju Island, and compared them with the southern Kyushu populations. We also evaluated their evolutionary potential and conservation value. The genetic diversity and structure were analyzed using 40 polymorphic microsatellite markers developed in this study. Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM) has been employed to develop our insights, which can be inferred from historical distribution changes. Contrary to our expectations, we detected a similar level of genetic diversity in the Jeju populations, comparable to that of the southern Kyushu populations, which have been regarded as long-term glacial refugia with a high genetic variability of East Asian evergreen trees. We found no signatures of recent bottlenecks in the Jeju populations. The results of STRUCTURE, neighbor-joining phylogeny, and Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) with a significant barrier clearly demonstrated that the Jeju and Kyushu regions are genetically distinct. However, ENM showed that the probability value for the distribution of the trees on Jeju Island during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) converge was zero. In consideration of these results, we hypothesize that independent massive postglacial colonization from a separate large genetic source, other than Kyushu, could have led to the current genetic diversity of Jeju Island. Therefore, we suggest that the Jeju populations deserve to be separately managed and designated as a level of management unit (MU). These findings improve our understanding of the paleovegetation of East Asian evergreen forests, and the microevolution of oaks.\nAn unexpected genetic diversity pattern and a complex demographic history of a rare medicinal herb, Chinese asparagus (Asparagus cochinchinensis) in Korea.\nDepartment of Life Sciences, Hallym University, Chuncheon, 24252, South Korea.\nRange-wide population studies of wide spread species are often associated with complex diversity patterns resulting from genetically divergent evolutionary significant units (ESUs). The compound evolutionary history creating such a pattern of diversity can be inferred through molecular analyses. Asparagus cochinchinensis, a medicinally important perennial herb, is in decline due to overharvesting in Korea. Eight A. cochinchinensis populations in Korea and three populations from neighboring countries (China, Japan and Taiwan) were examined using nine nuclear microsatellite loci and three chloroplast microsatellite loci to characterize molecular diversity patterns. The average within-population diversity was limited likely due to long-term bottlenecks observed in all eight populations. High pairwise F values indicated that the populations have largely diverged, but the divergences were not correlated with geographic distances. Clustering analyses revealed a highly complex spatial structure pattern associated with two ESUs. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) suggests that the two ESUs split about 21,000 BP were independently introduced to Korea approximately 1,800 years ago, and admixed in secondary contact zones. The two ESUs found in our study may have different habitat preferences and growth conditions, implying that the two genetically divergent groups should be considered not only for conservation and management but also for breeding programs in agricultural areas.\nDevelopment and characterization of 30 microsatellite loci for (Berberidaceae).\nAppl Plant Sci 2018 Dec 4;6(12):e01200.

In this study, 30 microsatellite loci, including 25 polymorphic loci, were developed for for use in population-level genetic analyses.\nMethods And Results: We carried out transcriptome sequencing and isolated a total of 30 expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeat markers from using Illumina HiSeq high-throughput sequencing. To test utility of the developed markers, we genotyped 60 individuals from three populations and estimated the number of alleles and levels of observed and expected heterozygosity.

The map shows the Korean island of Ulleungdo in the Sea of Japan labeled as \"Dagelet or Matsusima.\" It also shows to the northwest of Ulleungdo the non-existent island of Argonaut, which was the result of a mismapping of Ulleungdo by the British ship Argonaut in 1789.\nThe reason I am posting the map is that it was mentioned in an 1876 letter written by Watanabe Kouki (\u6e21\u8fba\u6d2a\u57fa), who was Director of the Bureau of Documents in Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the time. Mr. Watanabe was researching the location of Dagelet Island, which was the Western name for Korea's Ulleungdo Island, and he used this map as an example of Western maps that showed Dagelet Island at the coordinates 37 degrees 25 minutes N. latitude and 130 degrees 56 minutes E. longitude.\nBritain's \"Royal Atlas\"\nMr. Watanabe wanted to confirm the location of Dagelet Island because he suspected the Japanese name \"Matsushima\" (\u677e\u5cf6) was being used together with \"Dagelet\" to refer to Korea's Ulleungdo Island.

        "passage": "With people who share similar dreams and hopes, explore and discover Ulleungdo & Dokdo!\nHello, this is VANK youth leader, Yoojeong Jeong (YJ)! I\u2019ll be a three-day-reporter of 2016 Dokdo camp to give you glimpse of this camp:) This year camp was the luckiest camp ever, and you\u2019ll know why in a moment. Also, there are some bits of interviews added so as to hear real story from the members.\nYJ: So, What made you here to spend the last days of your summer vacation? Also, before you tell us more about this camp, would you please introduce yourself?\nS: I\u2019m Seo-won Byun and I\u2019m a student studying at Philippines. As I have more foreign friends than Korean friends, I could easily realize how foreigners have some wrong information regarding Korea. So, I was searching how to explain such wrong information in a right way and rectify them. That\u2019s how I reached VANK and this camp. As Dokdo and East Sea are the most representative errors regarding Korea, I wanted to learn more on this matter.\nD: Last not but not least, I\u2019m Dogyun Kim from Gimcheon! Currently, I\u2019m on the way to set up a VANK club at my school. Initially, this club started out as \u2018Comfort Women\u2019 club but we extended to other issues such as Dokdo and East Sea. And, while we were researching on these issues, we met VANK and decided to change this club into VANK club. With my club members, we participate in one-day lecture to learn more about VANK and the issues. During the lecture, I was moved and motivated to accomplish all the tasks from the lecture, and I was chosen as the camp member!\nAfter we landed on Ulleungdo, we went straight to Dokdo museum and Sigaji observatory. This camp started off with learning more about Dokdo and experience whole view of Ulleungdo. It was much meaningful as the first spot was implicitly intended for members to address Dokdo with objective approach, rather than emotional appeal.\nAt last, back at seminar room, we finally had time to introduce ourselves to others. Before we move into an actual team activity, we had two valuable lectures to help our members to understand more on the topic we are addressing. First lecture was truthfully motivated to bring out each member\u2019s passion to act toward wrong information. Gitae Park, head of VANK, has strongly urged members to make actual action toward the issue, rather end up being mad and complain to others. Although there are limits, there are always ways to confront this issue and take action as a student.\nNext lecture was informative lecture from Sori Lee to give utmost important information regarding Dokdo. She especially pointed out that we should not be cynical toward Japan, but to understand them. Furthermore, we should learn our situation and the perspective of the world, and thus deliver our history wisely.\nThen, the first team activity started out with exciting music and the performance that was created by each team member. It was only after few hours since team members met each other, but they tried their best to become a one team and deliver their thoughts on Dokdo. Just wait for a moment to hear more stories about the team activity.\nThe weather was perfect for our trip to Dokdo, two and a half hours away from Ulleungdo by ship. The wave was so still that we were not even supposed to take a medicine for seasickness. This is why this camp was so lucky! Thanks to the weather, we were able to spend about an hour at Dokdo, which rarely happens. We went to the eastern island of Dokdo where police guard of Dokdo stays. And, back again with our three wonderful interviewees to tell us more about our exploration!\nYJ: The climax of this camp, exploring Dokdo! How was it to actually visit and step on Dokdo? You guys might have felt something that is hard to put into words!\nSeo-won: To be honest, at first, I didn\u2019t have much expectation. I just thought that it won\u2019t be that different from the photo of Dokdo. However, I realized at a second as soon as I landed that photo cannot express beautiful scenery of Dokdo. It was much more beautiful compare to any other photos taken by photographers. I thought to myself that I need to protect Dokdo not because we have to. But, because we need to protect the beautiful view along with valuable ecosystem within the island.\nTaegeon: Visiting Dokdo made one of my dreams come true! It was my life dream to visit and explore Dokdo as my future dream is to protect the island. First, I wanted to become police guard to protect Dokdo physically. However, I wanted to protect Dokdo in other perspective such as becoming international lawyer and act towards it. Dokdo is a true motivation and crux of my dream.\nReporter YJ: Then, let\u2019s hear from other members who are also thrilled to tell us more! Let\u2019s invite our lovely friend, Juyeon:) So, Juyeon, how was the Dokdo trip?\nJuyeon: Hello, I\u2019m Juyeon and I just stopped by because I wanted to share my thoughts, too! Well, Dokdo would be the most memorable trip ever in my life. Some people would be questioned on why it is meaningful to visit Dokdo. I think this leads to same question why we go traveling. People these days enjoy traveling around the world, visit new places and experience new culture and unique life style. And these trips become bits and pieces of our memories that stay in our mind for a life time. It\u2019s same with Dokdo! As we traveled to Dokdo with our friends who share similar hopes and dreams, this also becomes haunting experience that could never be forgotten. The reason we act on Dokdo became our own efforts to protect our precious memories with our friends, not because we need to protect our territory. Trip to Dokdo has built unforgettable memory to all of us!\nAfter putting aside the sadness of leaving Dokdo, back at Ulleungdo, We had the second team activity. For team activity, each team had to discuss on specific ways of responding to major media, which is the primary source of spreading wrong information around the world. Such media includes CIA World Fact Book, Lonely Planet, Google Map, Microsoft Bing Map, and etc. All of teams were having common basis that they all have credibility on such media and this is the very reason why they should rectify the mislead information. So as to give credible information to all the readers around the world, media should not provide information that was intended to promote imperialism.\nAs the last day of the camp, we gathered in seminar room for wrapping up our camp by each of us sharing personal comments on the camp. And then, we went to last trip around the Ulleungdo that extended our haunting memory from Dokdo. As it is our last part of trip, let\u2019s get back to interview to hear the overall comment of this memorable camp!\nReporter YJ: So, our long but short journey to Dokdo & Ulleungdo has come to an end! It would be a bittersweet moment for all of us. Still, I would like to hear overall comment! There must be a lot of things that you learned and thought to yourselves.\nDogyun: Well, before I came to the camp, I was both excited and worried as I get to spend three days with people I first met. But, as soon as I arrive and meet my team mates, all my worries were gone and spend the days with excitements. Also, this camp would be a great help for me to set up VANK club in my school. Now, I understand VANK vision and right response toward Dokdo and East sea issue as in student level. With my club members, I would actively take action and pile up small changes to bring bigger changes. Personally, I have come up with approach to myself, as well. To myself, as my dream is to become researcher of biotechnology, I always dreamed of promoting peace in my own field of expertise. However, it seemed contradictory to be interested in global issues and disregard domestic issues. I would always try to be interested in both aspects along with building up my expertise. In short, this camp has become one of turning point for me in various ways!\nTaegeon: Personally, I thought I know many things about Dokdo. But, I realized that knowing is not enough, taking action is the most important part. The most memorable<|endoftext|>"

Uleungdo was an abbreviation of \"The Two Islands of Usan/Muleung\" (\u4e8e\u5c71\u6b66\u9675\u4e8c\u5cf6), which was \"one name two island\" (\u4e8c\u5cf6\u4e00\u540d) name for the islands Usanguk (\u4e8e\u5c71\u570b - Ulleungdo) and Muleungdo (\u6b66\u9675\u5cf6).\nDuring the Silla period, the formal name of Ulleungdo and Dokdo was \"The Two Islands of Usan/Muleung,\" which was used together with its abbreviated name \"Uleungdo.\" Dr. Seonu claimed that he has confirmed that the name, \"The Two Islands of Usan/Muleung,\" was used formally in documents, but that \"Uleungdo\" was used in everyday life.\nBefore 512 A.D., the people who set up a country on Ulleungdo were cognizant of \"Dokdo\" and used it as an essential territory. At the time, the concept of \"the two islands were not far apart, so they could be seen on a clear day\" (\u4e8c\u5cf6\u76f8\u8ddd\u4e0d\u9060\u98a8\u65e5\u6df8\u660e\u537d\u53ef\u671b\u898b) was established.\nDr. Seonu said that in 512 A.D. Usanguk became a part of Silla, the name \"Muleungdo\" was formed, and then the written expression \"The two islands of Usan/Muleung are in the sea due east of the hyeon\" was established.\nWhile the name \"Uleungdo\" (\u4e8e\u9675\u5cf6) was used for Ulleungdo and Dokdo in Silla and Usanguk, the name \"Ulleungdo\" started to be used as a dialect in the east coast region of Gangwon. In 1018 A.D., Usanguk fell, and the Gangwondo dialect name also became the commonly used name during the Koryo period.\nDr. Seonu determined that the final name for Ulleungdo and Dokdo went from \"Muleungdo\" (\u6b66\u9675\u5cf6) to \"The Two Islands of Usan/Muleung in the Sea Due East of the Hyeon\" (\u4e8e\u5c71\u6b66\u9675\u4e8c\u5cf6\u5728\u7e23\u6b63\u6771\u6d77\u4e2d), to \"Uleungdo\" (\u4e8e\u9675\u5cf6), to Ulleungdo (\u851a\u9675\u5cf6), to Ulleungdo (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6).\nSince \"Ulleungdo\" (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6) was the very last name for Ulleungdo and Dokdo, it is assumed that when Kim Bu-sik was compiling the Samguksagi, he mistakenly wrote \"Muleungdo\" (\u851a\u9675\u5cf6) as \"Ulleungdo\" (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6).\nOn maps in the latter Joseon, Usando was shown as Ulleungdo's Jukdo (Daetseom), and it is believed that during the time of [King ] Jeongjo and [King] Kojong, the name \"Songjukdo\" [\u677e\u7af9\u5cf6] applied to Dokdo, which demonstrated management and intent.\nDr. Seonu said, \"When you look at the name transition of Dokdo, the possesion of Dokdo was already established during the time of Usanguk and continued unbroken through Silla, Koryo, and Joseon.\" He added, \"Based on international law, Dokdo was never Japanese territory, and Japan only failed in its attempt to make it its territory.\"\nDr. Seonu advocates, \"We need to use Dokdo's original name of \"Muleung\" as a basis and compose a 'Muleungdwon' [Muleungdo Garden?] using Dokdo and ecological technology.

When exposed to sunshine, the human body creates serotonin which is effective in relaxing the brain and contributes to feelings of well-being and happiness. Phytoncides and their refreshing scents given off by plants stimulate the human central nervous system to relieve tension and stabilize the body and mind. Nature seems to be the most important thing for both physical and mental health.\nAs we enter into the winter months, the Korea Forest Service came up with six recommendations of recreational forests good for visiting in winter. The six destinations share one thing in common: they are where people can enjoy everything that both forests and romantic winter seas have to offer.\nDaegwallyeong Recreation Forest located in Gangneung, Gangwon-do (Gangwon Province) is the nation\u2019s first forest built for recreational purposes.  Some of the trees, grown from seeds artificially sown from 1922 to 1928, are of high academic value. The forest has a lot to offer for travelers: forest trails, botanical gardens, straw-thatched cottages in red clay, waterwheels and charcoal kilns. A pavilion overlooking the forest offers a wonderful panoramic view of Gyeongpodae Beach on the East Sea.\nGeombongsan Recreation Forest in Samcheok, Gangwon-do is one of the most popular sites for mountain biking enthusiasts. The magnificent ridgeline stretching out toward Yukbaeksan Mountain has posed a challenge for numerous mountain bikers. Standing on the peak of Geombongsan Mountain, you can get a beautiful view of the boundless open sea to the east and the tall Sageumsan Mountain (1,092 meters) to the west. On a clear day, you can see as far as Ulleungdo.\nHuirisan Pine Tree Recreation Forest located in Seocheon, Chungcheongnam-do (South Chungcheong Province) is surrounded by majestic pine trees maintaining its beautiful greenness all year round.

The residents of the island have known that Dokdo belongs to Ulleungdo all along since the human settlement on the latter island.\n1. I myself have made four or five visits to Dokdo over the past 45 years together with other villagers, Kim Yang-gon and Bae Su-geom, to collect sea mustard and catch sea lions.\n1. For my last visit to Dokdo, I borrowed a Japanese vessel and hired its owner Murakami and crewman Oogami. I hunted together with them.\n1. Dokdo can be clearly seen from Ulleungdo on fine days, and some of Ulleungdo\u2019s ships sailing the East Sea have drifted ashore on Dokdo. It is only natural for Ulleungdo residents to take a keen interest in Dokdo.\n1. I am aware that a group led by the Oki Islands magistrate from Japan visited Ulleungdo in the tenth year of Gwangmu, or 1906, and made the absurd claim that Dokdo was Japanese territory.\n1. I then heard that then County Magistrate Sim Heung-taek protested the unreasonable claim by the Oki Islands magistrate's party and reported this to the higher authorities after discussion with village head Jeon Jae-hang and other many community leaders in order to prevent any unjustified threat by the Japanese.\n1. I was fully aware that this was an important issue for Ulleungdo as I had social contact with Jeon and often visited the administration office.\n1. Then, when they heard about the claim of ownership over Dokdo by the Japanese party, the residents, fishermen in particular, became outraged.\n1. It was deplorable that, despite the report by the magistrate, as the overpowering of Korea by the Japanese forces was then in full swing, we did not hear any good news and Korea became annexed by Japan.<|endoftext|>"

The official doubts if this will be successful, because the charges against her are not very severe.\nAccording to the Ministry of Justice and the Immigration Department, there were 1,501,761 foreigners residing in Korea as of Sunday.\nAs of April, Chinese\u2014including ethnic Koreans from China\u2014accounted for 49.9% of Korea\u2019s foreign population. They were followed by Americans (9.3%); Vietnamese (8.1%); Japanese, Filipinos and Thais (3% each); Uzbeks (2.5%); Indonesians (2.3%) and Mongolians (1.8%).\nIn the comments to that post, some wondered just how many of these foreigners are ethnic Koreans. The answer to that question can be found in the most recent immigration report (from April), which can be found here.\nOut of 1,486,367 foreigners in Korea in April, 461,023 were Korean Chinese. If we subtract them from the largest dongpo (overseas Korean) visa categories, we're left with 3,600 on the F-4-1 visa, 61,000 on the F-4-2 visa, 7,700 on the F-4-11 visa, and 8,000 on the F-5-7 visa, or about 80,000 in total. Add that to the number of Korean Chinese and that makes for about 540,000 ethnic Koreans (though there are probably more on other visas), or more than one third of the total.\nOf the 80,000 ethnic Koreans who aren't Chinese, around 43,000 are Korean American (one third of the total 138,924 Americans; those connected to the US military make for another third), 13,000 are Korean Canadian (making for more than half of the 24,003 Canadians here) and 4,594 are Korean Russians.\nGlancing over at the E-2 stats, there are currently 20,965 E-2 visa holders here, which shows that numbers are continuing to decrease. It's quite a drop from the all-time high of 24,107 here in February 2011 (when incoming and outgoing public school teachers overlapped).\nOh, and just because we crossed the 1.5 threshold on Sunday doesn't mean that it will stay above that point. That figure includes tourists, and fluctuates depending on the time of year.\nHere are some stories about foreign teachers that have popped up over the past few weeks and months.\nLooking first at Chungcheongnam-do, on Monday the Joongdo Ilbo published an article titled \"Married native speaking teachers rescue woman who fell into water.\"\nOn June 2 at around 3pm the couple, who work at a middle school and high school in Daejeon, were walking in Maenyeon-dong in Seo-gu near the Expo bridge when they heard a strange sound and, running toward it, came upon a woman in her 30s who had fallen into the water. The husband and wife jumped in and together pulled her to safety and turned her over to 119.\nThe couple modestly said that it was just something they had to do, and that they didn't want their photos taken or names recorded.\nAs well, News 1 reported that native speaking teachers took part in a Korean cooking culture experience on May 25. Cultural experience programs for NSETs like this are often reported in the press.\nEnjoy it while it lasts, I suppose - back in March, the Daejeon City Journal reported that 760 Korean public school teachers were being trained by the Chungcheongnam-do office of education in order to replace native speaking teachers. Around the same time the Joongdo Ilbo reported that Hwadong Elementary school in Taean was having internet lessons every day for twenty minutes with Filipino native speakers in a program which helped 20 students from grades 3 to 6.\nIn less good news, the Chungcheong Ilbo reported that a 'foreign teacher' was booked without detention by police for stealing a cell phone worth a million won from a bar on May 17 in Cheongju's Sachang-dong. Since the words 'English' and 'native speaker' don't appear, I'd assume he wasn't an English teacher, but who knows?\nAs for the Busan area, Yonhap reported on May 27 that seven native speaking teachers as well as students at Busan International Middle and High School were organizing a fundraising drive for an orphanage in Kenya which one of the native speaking teachers worked at previously as a Peace Corps Volunteer.\nIn not-so-good news, Yonhap (and several other outlets) reported on May 24 that 54 year-old Mr. Shin was arrested for stalking a female American English teacher for two months. It started on April 1 when he saw the high school teacher in Busan's Bugok-dong, near where she lived, and began following her and speaking to her in English. He'd wait near where she lived when it was time to go to work and follow her, and even threatened to kill her if she contacted the police.\nIt would appear female foreign teachers haven't had the best luck in Busan. Yonhap also reported back in March that on March 9 a Canadian hagwon instructor was crossing the street near Haeundae Station when she was hit by a 125\u33c4 motorbike without a license plate and suffered a fracture to her femur. The 17 year-old driver fled but later felt guilty and turned himself in.\nAs for teachers from Gyeongsangbuk-do, several media outlets have reported that last weekend 16 native speaking teachers from Uljin went on a trip to Ulleungdo and Dokdo; this report even has a photo.\nThere are a few reports (such as this one about Gyeonggi-do and this one about Busan) about NSET cuts in public schools that I'll save for later.\nThe Joongang Daily took a lengthy look at the mess that is the Yongin EverLine last week. For more details on the project, have a look at Kojects, which has been covering it for some time.\nDaegu English teachers become honorary ambassadors...\nBits and pieces in the news about foreign teachers...\nA look at statistics related to foreigners in Kore...\nThe Joongang Daily took a lengthy look at the mess...<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": ", which is said to be comparable to American Thanksgiving. Although the actual day of Chuseok is only celebrated on one day, school was out on Monday and Tuesday, which gave me an extended 4-day weekend.\nAlthough I\u2019ve been itching to travel outside of Korea, I decided to not venture off too far because of the short amount of time given. I signed up to join a travel group to Ulleung-do, an island east of Korea\u2019s mainland. I typically like to plan my own travel, but Korea often makes it difficult to book tickets and accommodations unless you are a native. For this reason, I opted to pay 295,000 KRW (~$295) for Seoul Hiking Group to provide bus travel, ferry tickets to and from, accommodation, a few small meals, and also lead us to the island\u2019s must see places.\nThe ferry boat.\nTo put a long story short, this trip was one of the most unorganized trips I have ever been on. First off, there was no \u201ctrip leader\u201d to help guide the group of 40 people who paid to go. More than half the time, people were confused about where to go and there was no one to get answers from. Luckily, the only guy who could speak Korean stepped up and volunteered to help lead the group.\nI knew nothing about Ulleung-do prior to coming on this trip, and I still know very little about it. But if I had to sum up the island in a few words based on observation, I\u2019d say they\u2019re big on pumpkin, squid, and rock formations that look like animals or human genitals. The salty water surrounding the island is a gorgeous blend of blues and greens.\nCan you see the turtle behind me?\nClimbed up on turtle rock.\nSquid racks, a common sight here!\nIn front of the Pumpkin Goodies factory!\nPumpkin makgeolli, rice wine.\nBuddhist temple stop during the bus tour!\nThe \u201cbeach\u201d @ sunset.\nKorean flags galore!\nLast day by the seaside!\nThe scenes are picturesque and yet somehow I found myself feeling unpleased. I kept comparing what I was seeing to what I have seen before in other places, and my appreciation for it was lacking. I knew I shouldn\u2019t compare, because each place has its own uniqueness that should be revered but I just couldn\u2019t seem to kick my salty attitude to the curb. Maybe it was a buildup of shitty sleep on rock hard floors, dingy bathrooms, annoyances with the travel group, and more notably the 20+ mosquito bites all over my face and body that had me scratching like a crack feign.\nI knew that the main reason for my misery on this trip was all in my head. I\u2019ve been dealing with bigger stresses and negative feelings that I have tried to suppress, and they often resurface at the most inconvenient of times. I tried my best to enjoy Ulleung-do, which required me to break away from the group at times to explore not only my physical surroundings, but also my own restless mind.\nI had to remind myself that sometimes the best kind of vacation involves doing absolutely nothing, rather than trying to do everything.\nWell, even though it wasn\u2019t the best trip ever\u2026I did enjoy some of the bomb Korean fried chicken! When all else fails, turn to fried food!\nThe BEST boneless chicken I\u2019ve ever had!

        "passage": " from school, but it reads like that today if you look at the basic Chinese textbook. We've got two happy kids learning from a teacher, and they're learning to uphold party line.\nOn the one hand, that's totally anachronistic, and yet I as a teacher don't know what the kid is going to take away from that. Is the kid going to take away the story line, or is the student going to memorize the verb form?\nDEVIN STEWART: Every friend that I have who has studied Chinese language has been taught to recite communist doctrine as part of the language class. Is that pretty typical?\nALEXIS DUDDEN: I don't think it's abnormal. That's the rub right here. I think that doesn't necessarily make someone a communist, and I think of our so-called \"China hands\" in the State Department, many of whom were not even allowed to study in China until 1972; Taiwan was where you went for the language for so long. But it doesn't make you a communist to learn the language.\nThe thing that is causing concern is the way that these institutes insist on picking their own instructors and insist on having the students memorize language policies that are not necessarily open speech. I think of my best Japanese language instructor in Tokyo in 1991 at Keio University who looked at the textbook and said: \"Oh, this is completely not how Japanese people speak. This is not how we read,\" and he threw the textbook away. This was on a Ministry of Education fellowship at one of the best universities in the world, and he was fine. Nobody censured him. It was no problem. We all did great on the Japanese foreign language exam.\nThat's not allowed in the obverse, in the Confucius Institutes, and that's where the issue of freedom of academic expression and freedom of inquiry is at stake.\nIs China alone in that? At the moment, maybe.\nALEXIS DUDDEN: I'm just thinking this in the way that you've asked the question, in terms of South Korea, Japan, and the United States. There have been times in the last four decades that, say, the United States would have had similar influence on picking certain professors, the South Korean government certainly in the 1990s had similar influence.\nDEVIN STEWART: That's what happened with 38 North, right?\nALEXIS DUDDEN: That one's a little murkier in terms of right now.\nDEVIN STEWART: The Korea center at SAIS, the government wanted to select who the fellows were.\nALEXIS DUDDEN: Right. That works against the image of any society as an open society. So if a government is going to issue cash to an American university or a Japanese or\u2014work in circles here\u2014any of these places, then they should be willing to allow that university's faculty engagement with the institute because that is the point of an open-learning system.\nSpin it to something else like the Chinese government's commitment to new broadcasting techniques to rival CNN, to rival NHK World-Japan, then it's easier to say, \"Okay, you're spinning doctrinaire policy.\" That's up to the viewer to be able to figure out and parse.\nAgain, it's easy to target the Confucius Institutes. I guess while they remain at the level of language instruction, I think that's one thing. If the Chinese government starts saying to Columbia University or to Yale, \"You can't hire that person in political science or history because that's not the history of China because we've always had Taiwan,\" things like that would obviously be more overt interference.\nDEVIN STEWART: Talk to me a little bit about the history claims that the Chinese or Japanese want to put out there.\nALEXIS DUDDEN: Right now we have the example in which the Chinese government wants to ban international airline carriers from going to Beijing if they don't change their maps to read \"Taiwan, China.\" So far really only U.S. carriers are pushing back. Lufthansa has gone with the Chinese government. I was just flying on All Nippon Airways (ANA). This is a huge market. Are airline carriers going to say that Taiwan is its own country, or are they going to go with that market that they need for business?\nThere was a Japanese clothing company called Uniqlo\u2014I think there are several branches in the city\u2014that had a map of the world, and Hong Kong was not listed \"Hong Kong, China.\" The Chinese government protested, and the company changed the T-shirt\u2014if it's a T-shirt, it's a bag, it's a map\u2014on a piece of clothing.\nBut the Chinese government has just recently ratcheted up to include Taiwan and is testing first interestingly not in a university setting, not in a government setting, but something that they know needs business in China, which is airlines. Most airlines have actually succumbed to the demand because the market is more important than some notion of history. But that's how China is testing its ability\u2014at least as I see it\u2014to push this authoritarian approach to rule and society.\nIt's a tricky moment insofar as around the world liberal democracies are, if not in crisis, certainly having enormous moments of self-reflection and pressure. If there are movements within the great societies of the West to tighten control, to shut down, and to say egregious things that are now being supported from on high in the United States, England, and France, then why wouldn't the Chinese government pounce right now?\nAt the moment, yes, it's easy to see what the Chinese government is trying to do to shape ideas, but it's really up to the liberal order to stand up to that and withstand it by saying: \"No. We don't teach this way. If you would like to put a language institute in our university, we'll pick the textbook.\"\nDEVIN STEWART: You mentioned before the podcast that a similar eruption happened over a mango mousse. Can you tell that story?\nALEXIS DUDDEN: I think about these complaints, which on the one hand seem frivolous. Example, Taiwan on a map: Does it really affect your life as a Taiwanese person?\nDEVIN STEWART: Or does it affect the average passenger? Are they going to be brainwashed from now on?\nALEXIS DUDDEN: Especially if you got a really cheap ticket and you want to go to China for the weekend from X, Y, or Z. If you want to fly from Sydney, you're going to get the cheap ticket, so why shouldn't Qantas change? Who cares, in the one way of thinking.\nDEVIN STEWART: The blue one, right?\nALEXIS DUDDEN: The blue one, but it has both islands. It has Ulleungdo and Dokdo, the latter of which the Japanese refer to as Takeshima. Instead of just taking a pause and saying, \"Isn't it good that the Koreas are talking?\" the Japanese government lodged a formal complaint against the South Korean government saying that that was not their territory, that was Japan. It's a mango mousse with a frosting on it.\nThese are games at the top level that may be amusing to the people in charge, but they really do breed this kind of nationalist performance. I guess that's where I'm hesitant to condemn the Chinese government for language institutes if they can pull back, because that's a performative moment. Let as many people in the world learn Chinese as possible with Chinese government money, but don't tell them how they have to speak.\nAt the same time, yes, we should pay attention to things like the infiltration of the United States patent market. Things that are actually going to change societies are based in economics, and that is not just Marxian economics, that's the real world, and that is where China is making enormous gains, and it has nothing to do with language institutes.\nDEVIN STEWART: Your example about the Japanese officials getting wound up about the dessert and probably ended up being self-defeating in doing so reminds me of Jeffrey Kingston, who has written extensively about how he sees Japanese attempts to influence global narratives as quite inept, that Japan has not been the best producer of effective propaganda. I'm wondering, could you try to give us a sense of what are these countries trying to achieve with these campaigns, and who is the best at it do you think?\nAgain, the Fulbright program is not a Marshall program, it's not a pernicious program, but it brought an awful lot of important Japanese future leaders to the United States in the 1950s and 1960s including the future governor of Okinawa, \u014cta-san, who went to Cornell and didn't learn to be anti-American, but he learned to stand up as a liberal democrat for the people of Okinawa and lead the anti-U.S. base movement. Is that a bad result, or is that the most successful example of nation-building out there?\nIf we're really true to this whole 70 years of nation-building program, which has brought more wealth to more people than in any time in world history, then we have to say: \"Okay, we are going to be passing the baton at some point during the 21st century to China in terms of economic leader,\" and the trick will be to make it in China's interest to be the leader in an open way.\nI think Howard French's book China's Second Continent: How a Million Migrants Are Building a New Empire in Africa is absolutely important for everybody to read because this is maybe the future of the 21st<|endoftext|>"

It is bordered by the Amnok River (Yalu River) to the northwest, separating Korea from China, and the Duman River (Tumen River) to the northeast which separates Korea from both China and Russia. The country itself is flanked by the Yellow Sea to its west and the East Sea to the east. There are several notable islands that surround the peninsula including Jejudo, Ulleungdo and Dokdo. The Korean peninsula is roughly 1,030 km (612 miles) long and 175 km (105 miles) wide at its narrowest point. Korea's total land area is 100,033 sq km, and it has a population of 49.8 million people (2011). Because of its unique geographical location, Korea is a very valuable piece of land and an international hub of Asia.\nBuilt in 1395, Gyeongbokgung Palace was located at the heart of newly appointed capital of Seoul (then known as Hanyang) and represented the sovereignty of the Joseon Dynasty. The largest of the Five Grand Palaces (the others being Gyeonghuigung Palace, Deoksugung Palace, Changgyeonggung Palace, Changdeokgung Palace), Gyeongbokgung served as the main palace of the Joseon Dynasty. An effort by the Korean government has been ongoing since 1990 to rebuild and restore the buildings that were destroyed during the Japanese occupation. This 40-year restoration project aims to fully restore Gyeongbokgung Palace to its original form in the next twenty years. The palace also houses the National Palace Museum of Korea and the National Folk Museum of Korea.\nSince opening to the public in 1980, it has become a much-loved Seoul landmark. The tower's main attractions include multi-colored digital art projected onto the tower at night, a digital observatory, a roof terrace, the HanCook restaurant, the n.Grill restaurant, and the Haneul (Sky) Restroom. Namsan Seoul Tower's mountain surroundings on Namsan Mountain have made it a popular place to unwind for locals and tourists alike. Seoul has a number of viewing platforms where visitors can enjoy the nighttime cityscape or gaze out onto the Hangang (River) but the tower's Digital Observatory is unique, offering an astonishing 360 degree panorama over the city, and 32 LCD screens recounting the 600-year history of Seoul. That is why the observatory is so popular and such a source of pride. Situated on top of the N Plaza, the Roof Terrace is a spacious wooden viewing deck whose exotic atmosphere makes it very popular with lovers. A recent attraction for courting couples is \"Locks of Love,\" thousands of padlocks attached to the fence by romantic Seoulites symbolizing their undying affection.\nFor shoppers there is a mixture of street stalls and retail outlets selling everything from high fashion to casual attire, as well as many Korean cosmetics stores offering high-quality products at competitive prices. Myeong-dong is very popular with international visitors and fills with Japanese and Chinese tourists during the holiday period known as \u201cGolden Week\u201d which takes place in spring and is called golden week due to the week-long holiday period that takes place in Japan and China. Part of Myeong-dong\u2019s popularity stems from relatively affordable prices here, especially compared to the other shopping meccas<|endoftext|>"

That is all the information the Japanese Foreign Ministry gives regarding the incorporation of Takeshima/Dokdo on their website. But why in 1905 did Japan feel a sudden sense of urgency to include these two islets?\nAt the time of the Shimane Prefecture Inclusion Japan was a nation at war, fighting for regional dominance in Northeast Asia. The waters surrounding Ulleungdo and Dokdo were the scene of fierce naval battles. The following pages detail the naval conflicts that were fought before, during and after Japan\u2019s decision to annex Dokdo. This article will also give geographical context to Ulleungdo-Dokdo and Tsushima Islands. Through these battles can be seen Dokdo\u2019s role in Japan\u2019s quest for naval supremacy over the East Sea (Sea of Japan).\nThe map below left shows both Korea and Japan, note the naval port of Vladivostok in the center in the North.

Connected to the Pacific, the Sea of \u200b\u200bJapan by the Korea Strait in the south, the Tsugaru Strait between the Japanese islands of Honshu and Hokkaido and the La Perouse Strait between the islands of Hokkaido and Sakhalin, as well as the Sea of \u200b\u200bOkhotsk by the Tatar Strait in the north.\nThe Japan Sea has an area of \u200b\u200bapproximately 978,000 km \u00b2 at an average depth of 1,752 meters and a maximum depth of 4,049 meters. It can be divided into three basins: the northern Japan Basin is the lowest region, the Yamatobecken located in the southeast and the Tsushimabecken in the southwest. In Yamatobecken the water is shallowest on. Where the base is located at approximately 285 meters below sea level. The coasts of the eastern islands are wide and relatively flat, however, are the mainland coasts, especially in the west along the coast of Korea, steep, rough and rocky.\nThe Sea of \u200b\u200bJapan, although even more colder than the Pacific on the other side of the islands is of great importance to the temperate climate in Japan. The fishing is an important economic factor for the littoral states; An inter alia the resulting conflict that affects the fishing areas, led to a dispute over the ownership of the Liancourt Rocks, which are claimed by Japan and South Korea and controlled since 1950 by South Korea.\nIn the Sea of \u200b\u200bJapan, there are also deposits of minerals that are mined, but especially the sea is a major shipping route.

The governments of North and South Korea in particular are committed to ensuring that the name \" East Sea of Korea \" or \" East Sea \" is used instead of the name \" Sea of \u200b\u200bJapan \", or at least treated as equivalent. This proposal is far declined from Japan. Other states and international institutions have so far not taken a position, but continue using the name \" Sea of \u200b\u200bJapan \". In some western atlases and other non - official publications the term \" East Sea \" is used in parallel.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " is because most of them have died, and the generations born after the war came into power.\nOur presidents up to Kim Dae-jung all spoke Japanese fluently because they experienced the annexation. Park Chung-hee was anti-Japanese publicly, but in private he shared drinks with Japanese politicians speaking in Japanese. When the Japanese emperor Hirohito died in 1989, Kim Dae-jung went to the funeral and took a deep bow toward Hirohito\u2019s coffin. This would be unthinkable with our last three presidents.\nSo it will take some time, but when we have a president who were born in the 1980\u2019s or later, we will not be talking about our anti-Japanism.\nHopefully the anti japanism will die down plus the minjok myth that is causing ideological issues with North Korea.\nI feel this is seriously undermining Korea\u2019s geopolitical position. It\u2019s refusal to cooperate with Japan and align with it as well as other SouthEast Asian countries to counter China.\nOn the subject of Minjok and 5000 year history myth.\nHere\u2019s a lecture on the truths and myths of Korean history.\nHi. I\u2019ve just watched Prof. John Duncan\u2019s lecture on Korea, and found an error about his short comments on the Dokdo/Takeshima dispute (in the Q&A). In fact, the Korean king Kojong\u2019s 1900 decree referred to Ulleungdo, Jukdo, and Seokdo, and never Dokdo because the name Dokdo didn\u2019t even exist till later. This 1900 degree was about the Ulleungdo district, including the two tiny small islands nearby, but today\u2019s Koreans insist that this \u201cSeokdo\u201d meant Dokdo. Prof. Duncan says, \u201cKing Kojong told Japan not to fish near Dokdo,\u201d but in reality what the king said to Japan was not to go near Ulleungdo. \nAn interesting article in yesterday\u2019s Chosunilbo.\nLet me summary translate it in a few paragraphs.\n\u201cI am tired of reading daily articles on comfort women in the South Korean media. The group that hosts Wednesday protests in front of Japanese embassy, Chong Dae Hyup, is a leftist group with close ties to North Korea. The husband of its leader was arrested as a North Korean spy. Other members are also closely related to North Korea.\nThe South Korean public, who doesn\u2019t know the background of Chong Dae Hyup, is being deceived by its propaganda. Chong Dae Hyup\u2019s goal is to drive a wedge into U.S.-South Korea-Japan security partnership.\nI read a book by Professor Park Yuha of Sejong University, and she had a similar view on the comfort women issue as well.\nThanks. I see Wendy Sherman was right in what she was saying. The problem is the Korean establishment.\n\u201cI lot of readers didn\u2019t get the argument, and a lot rejected it. So I thought I\u2019d try again. Once again, when it comes to comments on this thorny issue, spare me the hate-mail and the racism.\u201d I\u2019m probably terrible at getting my points across, but here goes: I presume your \u201cpoint\u201d is the necessity of greater cooperation between Japan and South Korea. But posts like this and the earlier June 7th one, even when meant to criticize nationalism, actually just rehashes old nationalist grudges rather than focusing on other issues that are supposedly being neglected by Japan and SK. So of course it\u2019s extremely likely that a good deal of the responses you\u2019re going to get are \u201cdefensive\u201d Korean nationalists and maybe Japanese nationalists who want to chime in about \u201cYeah, see how Koreans can\u2019t be reasoned with?\u201d and not a lot of talk about J-SK cooperation. Acknowledge the issues between Japan and Korea (for what it\u2019s worth, I think Japanese imperialist apologia is overkill as a response to alleged Chinese/Korean intransigence on \u201cJapan bashing\u201d but anyway), but it might be better to focus on a \u201ccounter narrative\u201d that dwells on other specific issues that necessitate close J-SK relations.\nIs it not true that the S. Korean President\u2019s father was an officer in the Japanese Imperial Army?\nThat\u2019s why the Chinilpa label stings her more. It\u2019s also why she took the stance that she did with Japan and she went overboard with it.\nA slightly different approach to the war time experience by a Holocaust survivor, toward a former Auscwitz bookkeeper.\nIt is immediately obvious to anyone who has spent substantial time in the US that both its euramerican people and elites have an extraordinary, and negative, fixation with everyone else. USA\u2019s media talk about China and just about every other non \u2018white\u2019 country and people incessantly, usually with little journalistic objectivity and in negative terms, a recipient of the \u2018Western Wave\u2019 (watch for white analyses of the \u2018western Wave \u2018triumphantly arguing that \u2013insert here\u2013 housewives are learning English), a lurking military imperialist just waiting to subdue the \u2018western civilization\u2019. I could continue, but the point is that, as a social science observation, this obsession cries out for explanation, and it is hard to imagine that all this is just about democracy, law and order, first amendments, human rights, etc, etc. One obvious explanation for the sheer intensity of feeling is that white\u2019s disputes with everyone else have graduated from looting to identity. white people\u2019s nationalism is negative, based very much against everyone else. It is now widely accepted that white people\u2019s real ideology is not democracy, but a race-based ethnic nationalism in which they are defending the \u2018western\u2019 race against foreign depredation.\nby the way, south korea has not been culturally \u2018westernized\u2019 but modernized \u2013 which means modern global best practices and influences from everywhere, not just the \u2018west\u2019. and if you are implying americanization that has happened to a large degree, like it has everywhere around the globe including europe \u2013 do remember that usa is made up of western, eastern southern, northern, and every other civilization and people on this planet. it\u2019s not like south korea selectively took \u2018western\u2019 culture from america and left everything else behind. frankly, with the korean culture defines as it is by k-pop which is influenced by hip-hop and rap cultures specific to afro-americans and not westerns like you, one could argue that they are more everythingelse-ternized than westernized. and what would westernization mean anyway? do south koreans start wearing european traditional dress of skirts? and stop wearing central asian pants? do they stop reading books and stop wiping their asses with toilet paper and start using whatever \u2018western\u2019 culture did before it asianized?\nsouth korea has a minjok myth? and ofcourse you dont have an aryan myth right? hell even the term aryan is indian. who ofcourse \u2018received\u2019 their culture \u2013 from ancient europeans \u2013 as did egypt right? i get confused. should i call fox media and rupert to get confirmation. nope \u2013 i can just go down to the local library for an \u2018authoritative\u2019 historiography written by most euro-origin academics.\nwhat yardstick exactly does south korea have to measure itself against to display that its \u2018political\u2019 identity is democratic as opposed to race-nationalism? it certainly can\u2019t be european right? or any other political sub-national entity masquerading as an electorate in us or australia.\n\u201can elitist political opportunity structure have generated a robust street protest culture, a strong sign that elections are weak vessels of legitimacy\u201d \u2013 wow! were you describing south korea or the us, or just about any other country on earth?\nand how ridiculous that this article is being published in the website of an australian \u2018thinktank\u2019, a country that has a majority of european migrant imports who have installed a british queen as its official royalty, that has a tribal racial extremist past which has radicalised it\u2019s society and continues to rip-off native australians. not to mention the \u2018racial solidarity\u2019 that led it to host british nuke tests harming australia and the pacific and continue to contribute to current french nuclear weapons research. not to mention the recent political dog-whistles that buying japanese subs would \u2018bail-out\u2019 japanese companies that are \u2018struggling\u2019 apparently, as opposed to the thriving economies of mother-europe. with ethnic euro-american articles appearing touting faulty, sub-par german subs as \u2018stealthy\u2019, desperately trying to compete with japanese, and all of a sudden a few thousand jobs seems like a national issue to euro-australians.\nHi Robert, I know you don\u2019t care about the replies from Koreans.\nBut Korea is a free country that even allows you to write this kind of incomplete and personal insist that can even be leveraged by Japanese rightists. In Japan, you can hardly do the same. Why don\u2019t you go to Japan and give it a try?<|endoftext|>"

Anyway, I don't mind at all your pointng out my mistake, so if you think I'm wrong, you are all welcome to say so. I don't always agree with you, but I think it is OK. We can agree to disagree.\nAnyway, I think \"\u76f8\u671b\" definately suggests those two islands are close to each other, unless \"\u76f8\" was inserted by mistake like Sejong's geography text. And the sentece definately says \"\u5cf6\u5dbc\" exist to the east, not visible to the east.\nYou see \"\u897f\u671b\"\"\u6771\u671b\", right? So if the author wanted to say \"was visible\" east of Ulleungdo he should have said \"\u5cf6\u5dbc\u6771\u76f8\u671b \".\nActually I'm not 100% sure where exactly Korean considered Japanese territory is, since there is almost no clear record of Korean went to Japan on that sea route except for Ahn's inconsistant testimony. Rather I believe they didn't have enough perception what kind of islands exist where in the Sea of Japan between Oki islands. Choson government was interested in the territory which they can protect from Japan, not the islets no man can live on or attacked by Japan. The best explanation is that Korean considered the islands which is nearest to Jukdo (Liancourt Rocks or Oki) is the frontier of Japan and the sea between Jukdo and Japanese territorial islands (Takeshima or Oki) is the boundary. But this sentence clearly tells that Jukdo is the frontier of Choson which touches to the boundary between Japan. In the text, they are worrying about Japanese ships' coming to Choson, but not worrying about Japanese ships are voyaging in the sea of Japan. In 1694, Choson clearly recognised where exactly small island (Jukdo) is (2km east to Ulleundo) and in 1711, they idencified the island is so-called Usando (=Japanese Matsushima=Jukdo)that is the fromtier of Choson, not Ulleundo. They recorded on the official map. They didn't have to say the distance between Ulleundo and Jukdo since it is apparent. This text is confirming this recognition. Since Ulleundo had been still remained unsetteld for almost 200 more years until 1880's, Usando sometimes got ambiguous on Choson people's mind, but the concept that Usando(Jukdo) or Ulleundo which include Jukdo was the frontier of Choson, never had changed. until 1950's when Korean started to be aggressive to try to grab the territories from Japan, Tsushima, non-existant Palando and Takeshima. There is no record that Korean and Choson officials went futher from Jukdo for investigation.\nBy the way, chaamiey's opinion is almost same with mine.\n1. \"\u63a5\u4e8e\u502d\u5883\" means \"(Here(\u5cf6\u5dbc), Choson territory (Subject)) is in contact with their border with Japan.\n2. Subject on which Choson territory touhches to Japan as a border is \"\u5cf6\u5dbc\". Since the description of this islet is simple as \"\u9b31\u9675\u4e4b\u6771 \u5cf6\u5dbc\u76f8\u671b\", it is more likelyto be \"Jukdo\" which is near Ulleundo rather than \"Liancourt Rocks\". Liancourt Rocks is far from Ulleundo and nothing imply about this islets 92km from Ulleundo in the whole text.\nHe says it should be read as \"There is an island to the east of Ulleundo, and that is the border with Japan. (or beyond the island, it is Japanese territory.) if you put it simple.\nAnyway, as I said, it is perfectly OK that we don't agree on everything. So I respect your opinion.\nBut I'm going to ask Japanese professionals later. I'd like to hear their opinion, too.\nKaneganese, when I read your posts I don't know whether to laugh or cry.\nAs Gerry, pointed out, it is ridiculous to think Koreans would look at Jukdo Islet which is literally ten minutes rowing from Ulleungndo and deem this rock next to the boundary of Japan.\nKnowing there is an expanse of ocean lying beyond Ulleungdo it's pretty silly to assume Chosun thought the border was just a stones throw away. The fact the author mentions visibility leads us to believe the island was distant. You wouldn't describe a rock two clicks away as \"visible\".\nThe best translation is \"Visible to the East of Ullengdo is an island that is near, close to, or adjacent to the border of Japan\"\nThanks for translating of my opinion into English.\n\"Visible to the East of Ullengdo is an island that is near, close to, or adjacent to the border of Japan\"\nYou wrote the right thing for the FIRST time! This translation is quite near to Kaneganese's opinion.\nIt says that the island that is present at east of Ullengdo, Jukdo, is close to the border of Japan. So it means that beyond Jukdo is Japan's territory. And it also indicates that Liancourt rocks belong to Japan.\nSteve made a homerun for the first time! Good job!\nIt is ridiculous to claim that the 1714 passage was saying that Japan's border extended to up Ulleungdo's Jukdo. Why would Koreans have thought that? For example, ignoring Takeshima for a minute,would Japanese have thought that the Korean border extended up to Oki Island? No, right?\nAt the time, your border extended up your most remote island, not beyond to someone else's most remote island. Even though Koreans try to make the argument that Liancourt Rocks was Korean territory because it was within eyesight of Ulleungdo, this 1714 passage shows that Koreans considered Liancourt Rocks to be on the border of Japanese territory, which means they believed the island to be Japanese.\nThe character \u63a5 means to \"connect,\" \"join,\" or \"touch,\" which means, at least, two things or objects are needed to join, touch, or connect. The two objects in the 1714 passage were the island east of Ulleungdo and the Japanese border. Ulleungdo or Korea's border (\u5883) was not mentioned, which means the passage was not talking about the Japanese and Korean borders touching. It was talking about the island east of Ulluengdo and the Japanese border touching or connecting.\nKorea would not have considered Japanese territory extending up to a Korean island, and Japan would also not have considered Korean territory extending up to a Japanese island. Therefore, since the 1714 passage said that the Japanese border touched the island east of Ulleungdo, that means that the Koreans believed the island to be Japanese, not Korean.\nIn my opinion, that is the only logical conclusion.\nAt this point, Korea lost one point. I have a stronger logic for you. Read my correct translation.\nAs you wrote, \"At the time, your border extended up your most remote island, not beyond to someone else's most remote island\".\nSo Saito Hosen thought Ulleungdo was Japan's \"limit\" - he thought Ulleungdo was the most remote island of Japan.\nLooking from Korean side, the most remote island was Jukdo of Ulleungdo. So they thought that Jukdo contacts with the borderline. The area within Jukdo was Korean territory.\nIsn't this logical?\nYes, if Saito Hosen believed that Ulleungdo was Japanese territory, then he would have thought that the Japanese border extended to Ulleungdo, but he would not have thought that the Japanese border extended beyond Ulleungdo to the Korean coastline.\nYes, Koreans would have thought that Ulleungdo's Jukdo was the edge of their border.\nPacifist, you said Jukdo, not me. There is no logical reason why the people from Gangwan who frequented Ulluengdo would consider a large rock only 2kms from Ulleundo to be \"near the border of Japan.\" Especially when we consider they context describes distant Japan and the large expanse of sea beyond Korea. That is pretty ridiculous.\nThat means if the Koreans sailed for 20 minutes East they would be in Japanese territory. I totally disagree.\nGerry, as I've said the character \"\u63a5\" is meant to mean near or adjacent or adjoining to. It is pronounced as \uc811\ud558\ub2e4 in this case.\nAnd if you look at the usage of \u201c\uc811\ud558\ub2e4\u201d it is different than that of \u201c\uc787\ub2e4\u201d In Korean the term \"\uc811\ud558\ub2e4\u201c is meant for places. (such as In this case means is close to, adjacent to or comes in contact to. In all of these cases the island to the East is outside of Japan's territory and either is near or touches but it is not part of the boundary.\nThe term \"\uc787\ub2e4\u201c means connects but it is used for \"linking\" objects such as strings, threads, tables or pieces of objects. Again check the usage of each form of the character.<|endoftext|>"

Although the GOCI has shown excellent radiometric performance with little long-term radiometric degradation and a high signal-to-noise ratio, there are radiometric artefacts in GOCI Level 1 products caused by stray light detected within the GOCI optics. To correct the radiometric bias, we developed an image-based correction algorithm called the correction of the interslot discrepancy using the minimum noise fraction transform (CIDUM) in a previous study and evaluated its performance with respect to the physical radiometric quantity stored in Level 1 products, i.e., top-of-atmosphere radiance. This study evaluated the performance of the CIDUM algorithm in terms of remote sensing reflectance, which is one of the most important products in ocean color remote sensing. The resultant CIDUM-corrected remote sensing reflectance products were validated using both relative (within the image) and absolute references (in situ measurements). Image validation showed that CIDUM corrected the bias in remote sensing reflectance (up to 20%) and reduced the bias to?5% in the tested image. In situ validation showed that relative uncertainty was reduced by around 10% within the visible bands and the correlation between the in situ and GOCI radiometric data was enhanced.\nFigure. (a) Images of GOCI remote sensing reflectance acquired on 16 October 2012 (UTC 04) for Band 6 both before and after the CIDUM correction; (b) Profile of remote sensing reflectance along transect PQ.\nThis paper reanalyzes the aerosol reflectance correction schemes employed by major ocean color missions. The utilization of two near-infrared (NIR) bands to estimate aerosol reflectance in visible wavelengths has been widely adopted, for example by SeaWiFS/MODIS/VIIRS (GW1994), OCTS/GLI/SGLI (F1998), MERIS/OLCI (AM1999), and GOCI/GOCI-II (A2016). The F1998, AM1999, and A2016 schemes were developed based on GW1994; however, they are implemented differently in terms of aerosol model selection and weighting factor computation. The F1998 scheme determines the contribution of the most appropriate aerosol models in the aerosol optical thickness domain, whereas the GW1994 scheme focuses on single-scattering reflectance. The AM1999 and A2016 schemes both directly resolve the multiple scattering domain contribution. However, A2016 also considers the spectrally dependent weighting factor, whereas AM1999 calculates the spectrally invariant weighting factor. Additionally, ocean color measurements on a geostationary platform, such as GOCI, require more accurate aerosol correction schemes because the measurements are made over a large range of solar zenith angles which causes diurnal instabilities in the atmospheric correction. Herein, the four correction schemes were tested with simulated top-of-atmosphere radiances generated by radiative transfer simulations for three aerosol models. For comparison, look-up tables and test data were generated using the same radiative transfer simulation code. All schemes showed acceptable accuracy, with less than 10% median error in water reflectance retrieval at 443 nm. Notably, the accuracy of the A2016 scheme was similar among different aerosol models, whereas the other schemes tended to provide better accuracy with coarse aerosol models than the fine aerosol models.\nFigure. Water reflectance (\u03c1wn) retrieval accuracy of the (a) blue; (b) green; and (c) red bands in the atmospheric correction algorithm after integrating the four aerosol correction schemes. Chlorophyll-a estimation error based on OC3 [33] is plotted in (d).\nTidal flats are associated with complicated depositional and ecological environments, and have changed considerably as a result of the erosion and sedimentation caused by tidal energy; consequently, the surface sediment distribution in tidal flats must be constantly monitored and mapped. Although several studies have been conducted with the aim of classifying intertidal surface sediments using various remote sensing methods combined with field survey, most of these studies were unable to consider various sediment types, due to the low spatial resolution of remotely sensed data. Therefore, previous studies were unable to efficiently describe precise surface sediment distribution maps. In the present study, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) red, green, blue (RGB) orthoimagery was used in combination with a field survey (232 samples) to produce a large-scale classification map for surface sediment distribution, in accordance with sedimentology standards, using an object-based method. The object-based method is an effective technique that can classify surface sediment distribution by analyzing its correlations with spectral reflectance, grain size, and tidal channels. Therefore, we distinguished six sediment types based on their spectral reflectance and sediment properties, such as grain composition and statistical parameters. The accuracy assessment of the surface sediment classification based on these six types indicated an overall accuracy of 72.8%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.62 and 5-m error range related to the Global Positioning System (GPS) device. We found that 11 samples were misclassified due to the effects of sun glint and cloud caused by the UAV system and shellfish beds, while 14 misclassified samples were influenced by surface water related to the elevation, tidal channels, and sediment properties. These results indicate that large-scale classification of surface sediment with high accuracy is possible using UAV RGB orthoimagery.\nFigure.

The overall accuracy is 72.8%, with a 5-m error range, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.62.\nSince 2008, floating green tides (Ulva sp.) have been occurring continuously in the Yellow Sea (YS), and after 2013 floating golden tides (Sargassum sp.) have also occurred. The distribution, areal coverage, and migration of floating green tides have been actively studied, but most research has focused only on the western YS. Little is known about the floating golden tides in the eastern YS. The purpose of this study was to determine the long-term distribution of floating green and golden tides in the eastern YS using Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Landsat satellite images from 2008 to 2017. In addition, the migration of floating macroalgae with Global Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) surface current data were compared. Green tides were observed in 2008, 2009, 2011, 2015, and 2016 in the eastern YS. From a satellite image backtracking analysis, it was confirmed that the green tides observed in the eastern YS were supplied from the western YS. When the maximum areal coverage of green tide was compared between the eastern and western YS, the coverage in the eastern YS was found to be about 4 % of that of the western YS. However, in 2011, the largest amount of floating macroalgae was found in the eastern YS and it accounted for about 45 % of the amount in the western part of the YS. In the eastern YS, floating golden tides were found in 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017, with the largest amount of floating macroalgae occurring in 2017. Although there were no long-term golden tide data for the western YS, such that it was not compared to the areal coverage of the eastern YS, it was confirmed that the amount of golden tide supplied to the eastern YS gradually increased. A comparison between the migration of floating macroalgae and HYCOM surface current data suggested that the migration and flow directions were not identical, and were considerably affected by surface ocean currents during their passage into the eastern YS. From this study, the long-term distribution and changes in areal coverage of green and golden tides in the eastern YS were obtained for the first time. This information will be useful for understanding the long-term patterns of green and golden tides, and provides basic data for predicting the occurrence and migration of floating macroalgae.\nFigure1. Long-term trend of green tides in the eastern YS.\nFigure2. Long-term trend of golden tides in the eastern YS.\nWe show two major modes of East Asian marine heatwaves (MHWs) associated with two contrasting sea surface temperature patterns over the subtropical western North Pacific (WNP). In the first MHW mode, ocean warming over East Asia occurs along with the subtropical WNP from the earlier winter by an El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation. The basin-wide ocean warming is finally intensified to an extreme warming state around East Asia, where a high-pressure region in zonal waves across the Eurasian continent passes. In contrast, at the early stage, the second MHW mode is unfavorable with ocean cooling. However, MHWs over East Asia occur due to a significant intensification of a zonally elongated high-pressure zone in response to anomalous subtropical convection in addition to mid-latitude zonal waves. Due to the importance of persistent ocean warming as well as immediate atmospheric forcing, MHW inducible oceanic and atmospheric interactions are clearly distinguishable from those of atmospheric heatwaves.\nFigure.

        "passage": "\"The Name of Our Dokdo Was Originally 'Muleung (\u6b66\u9675)\"\n(Seoul = Yonhap) Reporter Kim Seong-yong = Document analysis saying that our Dokdo was called \"Muleungdo\" (\u6b66\u9675\u5cf6) for a long period stretching from the Silla period, through Koryo, and into Joseon has attracted the interest of the academic community.\nFormer head of the Metropolitan Air Quality Management Office and \"Dokdo\" researcher, Seonu Yeong-jun (55), who has recently received a doctorate from Seonggyungwan University, published a book on the 8th entitled, \"Dokdo during the Koryo and Joseon Periods,\" which made public the result of his research on the names of Dokdo and its dominium.\nAccording to the book, the first documentary evidence that both Ulleungdo and Dokdo were Korean land was in the \"History of Koryo,\" when, in the 13th year of King Taejo (930 A.D.), \"Uleungdo\" (\u828b\u9675\u5cf6) appeared. Uleungdo was an abbreviation of \"The Two Islands of Usan/Muleung\" (\u4e8e\u5c71\u6b66\u9675\u4e8c\u5cf6), which was \"one name two island\" (\u4e8c\u5cf6\u4e00\u540d) name for the islands Usanguk (\u4e8e\u5c71\u570b - Ulleungdo) and Muleungdo (\u6b66\u9675\u5cf6).\nDuring the Silla period, the formal name of Ulleungdo and Dokdo was \"The Two Islands of Usan/Muleung,\" which was used together with its abbreviated name \"Uleungdo.\" Dr. Seonu claimed that he has confirmed that the name, \"The Two Islands of Usan/Muleung,\" was used formally in documents, but that \"Uleungdo\" was used in everyday life.\nBefore 512 A.D., the people who set up a country on Ulleungdo were cognizant of \"Dokdo\" and used it as an essential territory. At the time, the concept of \"the two islands were not far apart, so they could be seen on a clear day\" (\u4e8c\u5cf6\u76f8\u8ddd\u4e0d\u9060\u98a8\u65e5\u6df8\u660e\u537d\u53ef\u671b\u898b) was established.\nDr. Seonu said that in 512 A.D. Usanguk became a part of Silla, the name \"Muleungdo\" was formed, and then the written expression \"The two islands of Usan/Muleung are in the sea due east of the hyeon\" was established.\nWhile the name \"Uleungdo\" (\u4e8e\u9675\u5cf6) was used for Ulleungdo and Dokdo in Silla and Usanguk, the name \"Ulleungdo\" started to be used as a dialect in the east coast region of Gangwon. In 1018 A.D., Usanguk fell, and the Gangwondo dialect name also became the commonly used name during the Koryo period.\nDr. Seonu determined that the final name for Ulleungdo and Dokdo went from \"Muleungdo\" (\u6b66\u9675\u5cf6) to \"The Two Islands of Usan/Muleung in the Sea Due East of the Hyeon\" (\u4e8e\u5c71\u6b66\u9675\u4e8c\u5cf6\u5728\u7e23\u6b63\u6771\u6d77\u4e2d), to \"Uleungdo\" (\u4e8e\u9675\u5cf6), to Ulleungdo (\u851a\u9675\u5cf6), to Ulleungdo (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6).\nSince \"Ulleungdo\" (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6) was the very last name for Ulleungdo and Dokdo, it is assumed that when Kim Bu-sik was compiling the Samguksagi, he mistakenly wrote \"Muleungdo\" (\u851a\u9675\u5cf6) as \"Ulleungdo\" (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6).\nOn maps in the latter Joseon, Usando was shown as Ulleungdo's Jukdo (Daetseom), and it is believed that during the time of [King ] Jeongjo and [King] Kojong, the name \"Songjukdo\" [\u677e\u7af9\u5cf6] applied to Dokdo, which demonstrated management and intent.\nDr. Seonu said, \"When you look at the name transition of Dokdo, the possesion of Dokdo was already established during the time of Usanguk and continued unbroken through Silla, Koryo, and Joseon.\" He added, \"Based on international law, Dokdo was never Japanese territory, and Japan only failed in its attempt to make it its territory.\"\nDr. Seonu advocates, \"We need to use Dokdo's original name of \"Muleung\" as a basis and compose a 'Muleungdwon' [Muleungdo Garden?] using Dokdo and ecological technology. Then we have to occasionally promote a plan that uses 'a place of dreams and romance.'\"\nAnd he repeat Sanbongdo is Dokdo before.....on 27th of Oct in the news?\nTo defend fairy tale theory of Korean about Liancourt Rocks, they would use another false theory and it makes more complicated situation into hell themselves...<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " two islands to the mainland on this 1710 Korean map. The above record is not unique, but one of many that show that Usando could not have been Liancourt Rocks (Dokdo).\nThe reason Koreans claim that Usando was Liancourt Rocks (Dokdo) is that without making such a claim, Korea would have no record or map before 1905 showing that she even knew about the rocks, much less claimed them. The problem is that there is nothing mentioned about Usando in Korean historical documents that would even suggest that Usando was Liancourt Rocks (Dokdo). On the contrary, all the evidence suggest that Usando was a neighboring island of Ulleungdo, most likely Jukdo, which is a small island less than four kilometers off Ulleungdo\u2019s east coast.\nNow that Nora has disappeared after I exposed \u2018her\u2019, there is no one around in the Korea related blogosphere to write about lesbian issues. I will make an attempt in true finger chopping wacky Occidentalism style.\nHere is a story. A guy in New York tries to pick up a girl, fails, spits on the girl or one of her friends, and is then attacked by a group 7 of lesbians. Story courtesy of Gay.com (standard denial \u2013 I am not a regular reader of Gay.com).\nSeven lesbians from Newark, N.J., attacked and seriously injured a street vendor in New York\u2019s West Village early Friday after the man grew angry when his advances to one woman were not returned, the New York Daily News reported.\nPolice said the women whipped Wayne Buckle, 28, with belts; the subject of his attentions, Patreese Johnson, 19, then stabbed him repeatedly with a steak knife, the Daily News said.\nI suspect these New York lesbians are a very tough breed (excuse the pun).\nOne of the women yelled \u201cShe\u2019s my girl, and no one hits on my girl!\u201d during the incident, a police source told the paper.\nThe lesbian that said that is definitely going to a womens prison. I thought the prison system was supposed to be punishment, not a reward.\nBuckle was recovering at a New York hospital in critical but stable condition.\nA \u201chate crime\u201d indeed. After beating him senseless with belts, and stabbing him repeatedly with a knife, they were arrested a block away from the crime scene, according to WNBC News.That means they ran away from the crime scene \u2013 I dont know why the article just does not come out and say it.\nThe stab victim was interviewed from hospital by the New York Daily News.\nAn oxygen tube pumping air into his lungs, the 28-year-old man allegedly beaten and stabbed in the West Village by a gang of petite lesbians described the attack yesterday from his hospital bed.\nStill shaken by Friday\u2019s terrifying assault, Buckle, an independent filmmaker from Queens, said he felt he was the victim of a bias attack.\nSeveral witnesses and police sources said Buckle sparked the attack by spitting on a 19-year-old lesbian after she rejected his advances outside the IFC movie theater on Sixth Ave. near W. Third St. He also allegedly cursed the woman, Patrice Johnson, using gay slurs.\nJohnson and six of her friends \u2013 all lesbians from New Jersey \u2013 pounced on Buckle at 2 a.m., whipping him with belts before Johnson stabbed him repeatedly in the belly with a 4-inch serrated steak knife, authorities said.\nBuckle was bleeding badly after the attack. \nThe seven suspects were arraigned early yesterday on charges of attempted murder, assault and gang assault. They were ordered held on $50,000 cash bail or $150,000 bond.\nHis eyes swollen, Buckle was hooked up to a respirator yesterday. He denied that he had provoked the attack and insisted he was not homophobic.\nI dont know. It is hard to tell exactly what happened here, but it looks like the lesbians wanted to escalate the situation because they were clearly willing to use violence. Normal people do not just go out and stab people, even if they suffer considerable provocation. Being spit on is not enough provocation to beat and stab someone so badly they need to go on a respirator, in my opinion. If I were the NY police, I would be looking for a history of altercations with straight men by the perpetrators.\nThat sure beats anything Kushibo/Nora ever wrote about lesbians!\nAn editorial about Yasukuni and all things relevant by George F. Will on the Washingon Post\u2019s site. HT to Richard of TPD.\nLeftist ideology causes South Korea\u2019s regime to cultivate victimhood and resentment of a Japan imagined to have expansionism in its national DNA. The choice by China\u2019s regime is more interesting. Marxism is bankrupt and causes cognitive dissonance as China pursues economic growth by markedly un-Marxist means. So China\u2019s regime, needing a new source of legitimacy, seeks it in memories of resistance to Japanese imperialism.\nActually, most of China\u2019s resistance was by Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s forces, Mao\u2019s enemies. And Mao, to whom there is a sort of secular shrine in Beijing, killed millions more Chinese than even Japan\u2019s brutal occupiers did.\nThe museum adjacent to Yasukuni says \u201cThe Greater East Asian War\u201d began because, when the New Deal failed to banish the Depression, \u201cthe only option open to Roosevelt... was to use embargoes to force resource-poor Japan into war. The U.S. economy made a complete recovery once the Americans entered the war.\u201d That is disgracefully meretricious \u2014 and familiar. For years a small but vocal cadre of Americans \u2014 anti-FDR zealots \u2014 said approximately that. But neither Koizumi nor Abe includes the museum in his visits to the shrine.\nThings are so bad that, speaking about the incessant incursions by Chinese submarines and military aircraft into Japanese sea and air spaces, a senior Japanese official casually made the startling suggestion that China\u2019s regime, like Japan\u2019s regime before the war, does not fully control its military.\nThe controversy about Yasukuni should not mystify Americans. With their comparatively minor but still acrimonious arguments about displays of Confederate flags, Americans know how contentious the politics of national memory can be, and they understand the problem of honoring war dead without necessarily honoring the cause for which they died.\nUPDATE: I just got a TV yesterday. I just saw a news discussion program that mentioned the images shown here below as being a recent and in response to Koizumi\u2019s recent Yasukuni visit.\nORIGINAL: \u2605\u53b3\u9078\uff01\u97d3\u56fd\u60c5\u5831\u2605 has a a collection of pictures from demonstrations in Korea I have never seen before. There seems to be no note as to when these were taken, but as I said, I have never seen them before, it\u2019s possible they are new and in response to Koizumi\u2019s most recent Yasukuni visit.\nDo keep in mind that not everyone goes completely wild and crazy, protesting in a more accepted form.\nSee more from the original link.\nAlso available, Anti-Japanese Photoshoping!\nI could be wrong about this, but Bush has never said to Koizumi that he should stop correct?<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "After receiving a request from Nakai Yozaburo, a resident of Oki Islands in Shimane Prefecture, to incorporate Dokdo into Japanese territory, the Japanese government reaffirmed, through a Cabinet decision made in January of 1905, its intention to claim sovereignty over the island. Consequently, in February of that year, the governor of Shimane Prefecture issued an official notification that Dokdo was to be put under the jurisdiction of the Okinoshima office of Shimane Prefecture.\nJapan illegally occupied Dokdo during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905.\nIn January, 1905, during the Russo-Japanese War, Japan incorporated Dokdo under the rationale of the acquisition of sovereignty over terra nullius. However, such an excuse was modified as \u201ca reaffirmation of Japan\u2019s intention to claim sovereignty over Dokdo\u201d because Japan realized that its own rationale of \u201cDokdo has always been Japanese territory\u201d and \u201coccupation of terra nullius\u201d conflicted with each other. Its claim, \u201coccupation of terra nullius,\u201d contradicted Japan\u2019s previous argument that Dokdo had no relationship with Japan, which is also shown in the State Council (Dajokan) Directive of 1877.\nThe Russo-Japanese War began in 1904 when the Japanese Navy launched a surprise attack against the Russian Pacific Fleet at Port Arthur and at Jemulpo. The Japanese Navy built watch towers at Jejudo, Geomundo, and Ulsan in order to monitor the movement of the Russian fleet. In August of 1904, two watch towers were installed in Ulleungdo, too, actions which stressed the strategic value of Dokdo.\nNakai Yozaburo was aware that Dokdo belonged to Joseon. He intended to submit a request for the lease of the island to the Joseon government through the Japanese government. However, Nakai submitted a petition to incorporate Dokdo, instead of a lease request, to the Japanese government in September of 1904, having been influenced by officials of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Japanese Navy Department.\nThe Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs attempted to reject his petition based upon the opinion that \u201cthe gains would be extremely small while the situation would become grave if the acquisition of a barren islet (Dokdo) suspected of being Korean territory...would amplify the suspicions of various foreign countries that Japan had an ambition to annex Korea.\u201d However, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs proceeded to incorporate the island with the rationale that hostile warships would be better monitored if watch towers were constructed, and wireless or submarine cables were installed there.\nJapan\u2019s incorporation of Dokdo in 1905 is void by international law. Japan argues that it incorporated the island based on the rationale of \u201coccupation of terra nullius.\u201d However, Korea had established its sovereignty over Dokdo in ancient times, and reaffirmed this under the modern law by issuing Imperial Ordinance No. 41 (see Material 9) on October 25, 1900.\nJapan discussed and notified its incorporation of Dokdo to Western countries, including the United States. However, Korea did not receive any query or notification regarding the unilateral incorporation. In March of 1906 the Governor of Uldo (Ulleungdo) learned of the incorporation from Japanese officials of Shimane Prefecture visiting Ulleungdo. The next day, the Governor of Uldo reported this to the central government in Seoul and to the governor of Gangwon-do. On receiving this report, the Minister of Interior and the State Council Minister stated that it is groundless for Japan to claim sovereignty over Dokdo, and ordered an investigation of the facts relating to what Japan had done. (See Material 10.) The Korean government, having been deprived of its diplomatic rights following the protectorate treaty in November 1905, was not able to take any diplomatic action against such a situation. However, Korean newspapers, including the Daehan Daily Newspaper (Daehan maeil sinbo) (May 1, 1906) (see Material 11) and The Hwangseong Newspaper (Hwangseong sinmun) (May 9, 1906), published articles protesting against the Japanese act.\nThe Gazette Containing Imperial Ordinance No. 41Korea renamed Ulleungdo as Uldo, and raised the highest administrative position in Ulleungdo to County Magistrate of Uldo. The County Magistrate gained authority over the whole of Ulleungdo, Jukdo, and Seokdo. Korean Imperial Ordinance No. 41 was issued in Korean Gazette No. 1716 on October 27, 1900.\nIn 1906, the Chuncheon County Magistrate and acting Governor of Gangwon-do Lee Myeong-nae informed State Council Minister Park Je-sun of Japan\u2019s incorporation of Dokdo, which belonged to Korea, immediately after this Japanese act was reported by the Uldo (Ulleungdo) Governor Sim Heung-taek. In response to this, Park stated that Japan\u2019s claims to Dokdo were unfounded and through Order No. 3 commanded that a close eye be kept on the situation on Dokdo and the movements of the Japanese there.<|endoftext|>"

Who told the Korean government that Liancourt Rocks was Korean territory?\nWell, according to Yu Jin-o ((\u6d2a\u937e\u4ec1), who was quoted in the article, the Korean Prime Minister at the time told him that Korean President Rhee Syng-man had tasked him with finding out the boundaries of Korean territory. The Korean Prime Minister said the Korean President recommended that he go to Korean historians for the answers. As a result, the Prime Minister went to the renowned Korean historian Choi Nam-seon (\u5d14\u5357\u5584), who told him that old Korean texts recorded that Korea's easternmost boundry was \"Dokdo\" (\u7368\u5cf6) and its southwestern boundary was Parangseo (\u6ce2\u6d6a\u5dbc).\nI think Mr. Choi Nam-seon mistook Ulleungdo's neighboring island of \"Jukdo\" (\u7af9\u5cf6), which is only 2 km off Ulleungdo's east shore, for Japan's \"Takeshima\" (\u7af9\u5cf6), which is about 90 km to the southeast of Ulleungdo, because both names used the same Chinese characters: \u7af9\u5cf6. And I think Korea's Patriotic Old Men's Association made the same mistake. In fact, Choi Nam-seon may have even been one of those Patriotic Old Men.\nHere is my translation of the June 16, 1973 article.\n\"In Science there are no miracles. We are at sea at coordinates 32\u00ba 10' N and 125\u00ba E. Within the twenty mile range of visibility, Parang Island cannot be detected.\"\nIn August 1951 Mr. Hong Jong-in (\u6d2a\u937e\u4ec1), the head of the research team sent to find Parang Island in the sea 180 kilometers (km) to the southwest of Jejudo, sent the above cable to Son Won-il (\u5b6b\u5143\u4e00), the Chief of Naval Operations. At the time Mr. Hong was the chairman of the Korean Alpine Club and editor-in-chief of the Chosun Ilbo.\nWhen the United States and Japan were making the first draft of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, the research team sent to find Parang Island, with the help of the navy, searched the waters 180 km southwest of Jejudo, but, in the end, were unable to find it.\nFor now, Jeju authorities have returned his application, giving the reason, \"It shows up as a reef on navigational charts and is outside our territory.\" However, the question is whether it is really an island coming up out of the sea at that location or whether it is part of the contiental shelf. If it is part of the continental shelf, then how it will be treated under international law becomes a question of interest.\nHan Gwang-seop said, \"Navigational charts show that spot labeled only as as \"current breaks.\" It is obvious that it is not an island above the surface of the water.\" According to the (Geneva) Convention on the Law of the Sea, 'An island is a natural area that is surrounded by water and sticks up out of the water at high tide.' It defines an area that naturally sticks up above the water at low tide but is submerged at high tide as an 'elevated area.' If an elevated area is outside territorial waters, it cannot have its own territorial waters.\"\nIn 1951 the naval vessel ordered by President Rhee to do the first on-site search ended up not finding it.\nIf it is submerged at high tide, it is not an island.\nIf it is part of the continental shelf, it becomes a problem dealt with under international law, which would generate a lot of interest.\nAt the time of the evacuation to Busan, I went to see Prime Minister Jang Myeon (\u5f35\u52c9), who said he had been instructed by the President to find the borders of our territory. He was told to prepare for Korea-Japan talks by first meeting with historians. Therefore, he met Choi Nam-seon (\u5d14\u5357\u5584), who told him that old texts recorded our territory as Dokdo (\u7368\u5cf6) to the east and Parangseo (\u6ce2\u6d6a\u5dbc) to the southwest, so he said we should do an on-site survey. Hong Jong-il (\u6d2a\u937e\u4ec1) was made the team leader, and a naval survey team was sent to the site, but they were unable to find the island in the end.\nMisters Yu Jin-o (\u516a\u93ad\u5348) and Hong Jong-in (\u6d2a\u937e\u4ec1) said that if it is only a reef and not an island, then it cannot be a territorial issue or be subject to administration with an occupation permit under international law, but if it can be confirmed as an island, then we could argue that our territory should be extended out to there. An official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said on the 19th, \"If it submerges at high tide and appears at low tide, it is an elevated area that is not recognized as an island under international law, and a place like that cannot be the object of possession.\"\nThe experts say that the issue with Parang Island is still unconfirmed, and even if it is confirmed, it will still remain open seas if it is a reef and not be a territorial issue.\nIn an August 5, 1948 letter of petition to General Douglas MacArthur, a Korean organization known as the Patriotic Old Men's Association claimed that a \"series of islands\" named \"Parangdo\" belonged to Korea, but in spite of listing coordinates for the islands and giving distances to them HERE, no one could find them, so Korea dropped its claim.\nHowever, in the following June 16, 1973 article, the Korean newspaper Maeil Gyeongje Sinmun reported the discovery of two newly discovered islands 177.6 kilometers to the southwest of Jeju Island (\u6fdf\u5dde\u5cf6). The Korean man who discovered them named them \"Parangseo\" (\ud30c\ub791\uc11c) and \"Harangseo\" (\ud558\ub791\uc11c).\nIn the open sea 177.6 kilometers to the southwest of Jejudo, two uninhabited islands have been discovered for the first time. The man who discovered them is Han Gwang-seop (\u97d3\u5149\u71ee), who lives in Jeju Province. On the 15th he submitted an application for a permit to occupy waters on the open seas.\nThe two islands are 177.6 kilometers southwest of our southernmost island of Marado (\ub9c8\ub77c\ub3c4) at 32\u00ba 10' N and 125\u00ba E in the East China Sea. They are just small, rocky islands. The area of one is 5.2 million sq. meters, and the area of the other is 3.92 million sq. meters.\nMr. Han has named the islands \"Parangseo\" (\ud30c\ub791\uc11c) and \"Harangseo\" (\ud558\ub791\uc11c). On sea charts they are listed as a reef.\nA group of Koreans who referred to themselves as the Patriotic Old Men's Association (\u6182\u570b\u8001\u4eba\u6703), headquarted in Seoul, Korea, sent a 6-page petition letter dated August 5, 1948 to General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP), claiming Korean sovereignty over \"Docksom,\" Ulleungdo, Tsushma, and \"Parang\" Islands. The letter was apparently received by or transferred to the US Political Adviser for Japan because carbon copies were made and sent to the US Representative in Seoul with a September 16 cover letter explaining the Korea petition. The cover letter and the 6-page Korean petition are posted below.\nNotice in their claim for \"Docksum\" (Liancourt Rocks) that they wrote that the Korean name meant \"pot island\" and that it was given that name because it looked like a pot. Apparently, the Patriotic Old Men never saw Liancourt Rocks because they look nothing like a pot. The name \"Dokdo\" (\u7368\u5cf6) actually means \"Lonely Island.\"\nThe Patriotic Old Men seem to have thought Liancourt Rocks was a reference to either Ulleungdo or Ulleungdo's neighboring island of Jukdo (\u7af9\u5cf6), which is just two kilometers off Ulleungdo's east shore. Not only does Ulleungdo's neighboring island of Jukdo look more like a \"pot\" than Liancourt Rocks, the name \"Jukdo\" (\u7af9\u5cf6) uses the same Chinese characters as the Japanese name for Liancourt Rocks, \"Takeshima\" (\u7af9\u5cf6). The fact that the same Chinese characters were used for both islands is probably the source for the misunderstanding. The Patriotic Old Men must have thought the Japanese were trying to claim Ulleungdo and its neighboring of Jukdo.\nThe article claims that the Japanese had the MacArthur Line drawn to include Socotra Rock on the Japanese side, but I think it is possible that the Koreans simply assumed that from maps showing the MacArthur Line.\nNotice in the article below<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": ", we reported that the AG rich in CQ compound lowers the total lipid, triglyceride, phospholipid, and cholesterol levels in animal model [15]. Although AG's effect on body weight in rats has been reported [15], no study has focused on the antiadipogenic effect of AG in vitro. Specific adipogenic signal genes were examined to elucidate the specific mechanism underlying the effect of AG. The present study considered the antiobesity and antiadipogenic effects of AG in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and mice.\n\nPlant Material and Preparation of the Extract.\nAG leaves from Ulleungdo Island, Republic of Korea, were dried and crushed for extraction. The dried material was refluxed with 70% EtOH for 6 h at 60 \u2218 C. The extract was filtered, concentrated under reduced pressure, and then freeze-dried to obtain a solid extract powder.\n\nCell\nCulture. The 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Life Technologies Inc., Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, 100 g/mL streptomycin, and 100 units/mL penicillin at 37 \u2218 C in 10% CO 2. The cells were grown to confluency in 10% calf serum/DMEM. Two days after the cells had reached confluency (day 0), they were stimulated with a methylisobutylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin (MDI) induction medium (DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), 1 m/mL dexamethasone, and 1 g/mL of insulin). Two days after stimulation with MDI (day 2), the medium was changed to an insulin medium (DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 g/mL of insulin). Two days later (day 4), the medium was changed to 10% FBS/DMEM. The cells were fed with 10% FBS/DMEM every 2 days. Full differentiation was achieved by day 8.\n\nOil Red O Staining.\nTo determine both adipogenic potential and fat accumulation, we stained the cells with oil red O (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). On day 8, the cultured cells were washed thrice with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) and then fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed 3 times more with PBS and stained with 0.5 g/mL oil red O for 15 min. After rinsing with PBS, we captured representative photomicrographs using a microscope and measured fat accumulation.\n\nAdipoRed\nAssay. 3T3-L1 cells were cultured in 6-well plates at a density of 3 \u00d7 10 5 cells per well and set up to differentiate in the presence and absence of AG. On day 2 and day 8 of differentiation, the cells were exposed with AdipoRed (Lonza, Houston, TX, USA), and intracellular triglyceride (TG) level was analyzed.\n\nLeptin\nAssay. For the periods indicated, 3T3-L1 cells were treated with AG or not. Conditioned media from the final 24 h of culture were collected. Leptin concentrations were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Mouse Leptin Assay Kit, Immuno-Biological Laboratories Co., Tokyo, Japan).\n\nReal-Time PCR Analysis.\nTotal RNA was isolated from the differentiated 3T3-L1 cells and epididymal adipose tissue by using Easy-Blue Reagent (Intron Biotechnology Inc., Gyoenggi-do, Republic of Korea) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then, total RNA qualification was performed with an Epoch micro-volume spectrophotometer system (BioTek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). An equal amount of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA with a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The program was set for 10 min of initiation at 25 \u2218 C, followed by 90 min of incubation at 50 \u2218 C and 5 min at 85 \u2218 C. Primers were obtained from Bioneer (Daejeon, Republic of Korea). All primer sequences and annealing temperatures are shown in Table 1. A Step One Plus Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with an SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) and primers (Bioneer, Seoul, Republic of Korea) was used to carry out a real-time PCR. The steps were as follows: 10 min at 95 \u2218 C, 40 cycles of 5 s at 95 \u2218 C, 45 s at 60 \u2218 C, a final melting curve of 15 s at 95 \u2218 C, 1 min at 60 \u2218 C, 15 s at 95 \u2218 C for tissues, or for cells, and 5 min followed by 35 repetitive thermal cycles (94 \u2218 C for 30 s, 60 \u2218 C for 30 s, and 72 \u2218 C for 30 s). Fold changes of gene expression were calculated using the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method (Applied Biosystems). The data were normalized for the initial control, GAPDH.\n\nWestern Blot\nAnalysis. The 3T3-L1 cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl 2, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture). Determination of the protein was carried out on Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by a transfer to PVDF membranes (EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA). Then, the membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% tween 20 (TBST) at room temperature for 1 h and incubated at 4 \u2218 C overnight with 1 : 1000 dilutions of primary antibodies. The following day, the membranes were washed with TBST 3 times for 10 min each and made to react with 1 : 2500\n\nAnimal Experiments.\nMale C57BL/6J mice, weighing 15-17 g at an age of 3-4 weeks, were purchased from Daehan Biolink (DaeJeon, Republic of Korea). They were housed (5 mice/cage) under a 12 h light-dark cycle, at 23 \u00b1 2 \u2218 C, and a relative humidity of 55% \u00b1 10%, under conditions that followed the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals; they were allowed diet and water ad libitum. After 1 week of acclimation, 40 mice were divided randomly and equally into 4 groups of 10 each. Mice in group 1 (CON) were fed standard chow and those in group 2 (HFD) a HFD (40% fat). group 3 (AG1) consisted of mice fed with the same HFD, which included 1% AG extract (1% w/w in HFD), and group 4 (AG5) consisted of mice fed HFD with 5% added AG extract (5% w/w in HFD). Mice were fed experimental diet for 10 weeks. Body weight was recorded weekly. After an overnight fast at the end of the experimental period, tissue collection was performed. The animals were sacrificed by cervical spine dislocation and the livers, epididymal, retroperitoneal and total fat pads were dissected, weighed immediately, and frozen at \u221280 \u2218 C.\n\nAG-Mediated Inhibition of Adipogenesis in Preadipocytes.\nTo determine whether AG has an antiobesity effect, we carried out adipocyte differentiation using 3T3-L1 cells, both in the presence and the absence of AG. After 8 days, oil red O was added to the cultured cells, and fat accumulation and intracellular triglyceride levels were analyzed. Troglitazone, an antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory drug [16], was used as a positive control for the inhibition of fat accumulation. As shown in Figure 1, the number and size of cytosolic lipid droplets markedly decreased (Figure 1(a)), and reduction in fat accumulation, dependent on concentration, was observed (Figure 1(b)). Intracellular TG was analyzed with the AdipoRed assay. On day 2, the accumulation of TG in the differentiated cells was similar to that in the AG-treated cells (Figure 1(c)). After 8 days, the AG-treated differentiated cells showed significantly lower TG levels, exhibiting a dosedependent change, than those in the untreated differentiated cells (Figure 1(d)). To assess cellular capacity to produce adipocyte-derived hormones, we monitored the expression of leptin, a well-documented hormone with anti-diabetic properties, in cells of adipocyte lineage. Significant suppression of leptin protein secretion was observed in 3T3-L1 cells by the treatment with AG (Figure 1(e)). Cells treated with AG were harvested at day 8, and the expressions of genes were analyzed by real-time PCR. Each bar represents the mean \u00b1 SEM of triplicate PCR reactions, and mRNA samples were obtained from experimental adipocyte cells. # < 0.05 versus ND group. * < 0.05 versus CON group, * * < 0.01 versus CON group, and * * * < 0.001 versus CON group.\n\nAG Regulation of the Expression of Adipogenic\n8-day AG treatment of cells reduced the mRNA expression of PPAR, C/EBP, SREBP1c, and LXR ( Figure 2).\n\nAG-Mediated Reduction of Body Weight, Visceral Epididymal, Retroperitoneal, and Total Fat-Pad Weights, and Liver\nWeight in HFD-Induced Obese Mice.

        "passage": "The following is an 1874 Japanese map of Joseon Korea called, \u201cDetailed Map of the Country of Joseon\u201d (\u671d\u9bae\u570b\u7d30\u898b\u5168\u56f3).\nThe map shows Usando (\u4e8e\u5c71\u5cf6) as a small island to the south of Ulleungdo (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6). At the time, Korean maps were showing Usando as Ulleungdo\u2019s neighboring island of Jukdo, which is 2.2 kilometers off Ulleungdo\u2019s east shore, so that means that this map did not reflect the Korean preception of Ulleungdo at the time. In other words, the Japanese had an outdated map of Ulleungdo in 1874.\nThe following is text that was written at the bottom of the map and explained certain aspects of it.\nOne aspect the text explained was the island of Ulleungdo (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6). Here is a cutout of the section describing Ulleungdo.\nUlleungdo (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6), also known as Isotakeshima (\u5f13\u5d69\u5cf6 \u2013 \u30a4\u30bd\u30c0\u30b1\u5cf6), is part of Gangwon Province. It is located in the sea 1,000 ri from Samcheok (\u4e09\u965f). It has a circumference of 940 to 950 ri.\nUlleungdo (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6), also known as Isotakeshima (\u5f13\u5d69\u5cf6 \u2013 \u30a4\u30bd\u30c0\u30b1\u5cf6), is part of Gangwon Province. It is located in the sea 1,000 ri from Samcheok (\u4e09\u965f), and has a circumference of approximately 140 to 150 ri.\nThe above translation makes much more sense since the circumference of Ulleungdo was approximately 140 to 150 ri. At any rate, the above map is evidence that, in 1874, Japan knew that Usando was a neighboring island of Ulleungdo, but still did not know the exact location.\nAt any rate, the above map is evidence that, in 1874, Japan knew that Usando was a neighboring island of Ulleungdo, but still did not know the exact location.\nUTSURYO-TO Island(\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6), otherwise known as ISOMOYA-TO Island(\u5f13\u5d69\u5cf6), is an island attached to KOGENDO(\u6c5f\u539f\u9053). It is located 1000 ri(\u5343\u91cc) away across the sea from SANSYO(\u4e09\u6e09) and its perimeter is 945 ri(945\u91cc).\nI am not sure if \u201cISOMOYA-TO\u201d is correct because the third character of Kana letters written between lines is blurred.\nCaptitalized words show that they are read in Japanese.\nI think \u4e5d\u767e\u56db\u4e94\u5341\u91cc should be 940~950 ri, not 945 ri.\nThanks Madboots, Ponta, & Pacifist.\nI am curious about the name \u5f13\u5d69\u5cf6, which also appears on this 1806 Japanese map of Korea. Is it possible that \u5f13\u5d69\u5cf6 could have been another way to write Usando (\u4e8e\u5c71\u5cf6), which literally means \u201chigh mountain island\u201d?\nHe wrote \u201c\u5f13\u5d69 \u30a4\u30bd\u30c0\u30b1\u201don a mountain in Ullungdo.\nYes, I used to assume that the \u201cTakeshima\u201d in Isotakeshima was referring to \u201cBamboo Island,\u201d but the Chinese character, \u5d69, suggest that it was referring to the \u201ctall mountain\u201d (\u5d69 = tall mountain) on Ulleungdo. That is why I am wondering if the name \u201cIsotakeshima\u201d might have evolved from \u201cUsando\u201d (\u4e8e\u5c71\u5cf6), which also means \u201cTall Mountain Island\u201d?\ngroup in America, whose aim is empowerment of Japanese Americans.\nJPCL is the first Japanese group in America that publicly supports such a resolution.\nand on the Japanese government to correct its historic texts.\nresolution early next month.\nReally? What is JPCL?\nI can\u2019t believe this. Can someone confirm about this news?\nGerry again what you have is a Japanese copy of a Korean map. It\u2019s a huge error of yours to automatically assume the territorial perceptions of \u201cthe Japanese\u201d on maps made by other countries.\nJapanese cartographers copied maps from all countries. At this time in the 19th Century Japanese mappers were citing maps from all around the world. So to take one map from historical archives and say \u201cthe Japanese thought\u2026\u201d is not a very logical approach to history.\nThe Japanese mappers had confused perception of this region as whole. However for the most part their belief was that two islands existed in the East Sea. The Japanese were placing Dokdo (Matsushima) and Ulleungdo (Takeshima) all over the East Sea during this time. The position of the islands was usually wrong and the form was almost never correct.\nWhat happened to the Japanese in 1840 gives us insight as to how foreign maps affected Japanese maps. The first Europeans mapped Ulleungdo too far West and named it Argonaut later it was mapped correctly and named Dagelet. This created two \u201cUlleungdo\u2019s\u201d in the East Sea, the Westerly island was non-existent (Argonaut) and the Eastern (Dagelet) was correctly located.\nSee this European map.\nFrom there Japanese mapmakers copied the European maps and blindly drew \u201ctwo islands\u201d Ulleungdo and Dokdo more Westerly. Note the position and shape of this Japanese map is exactly the same as the European map above.\nWhen Seibold assigned the name Takeshima to the non-existent \u201cArgonaut\u201d and Matsushima to Dagelet the Japanese began to perceive Ulleungdo and Dokdo much farther West.\nIt is possible that \u5f13\u5d69 means a mound like an arch.\nmadboots Good job!!\nI don\u2019t know about the organization, but there are Japanese who support the resolution.\nI think it would be wired if people of the democratic country unanimously agree on political issue, though there are such countries in East Asia.\nThis could also be said of Korean maps. When the Japanese viewed Korean maps of the East Sea, they again saw two islands in the East Sea. At a glance they could see that the scale of these maps was off. Ulleungdo was much to close to the Korean mainland for these maps to be of accurate scale, so they too considered Usando to be Matsushima. The Japanese government had very little information of the islands directly next to Ulleungdo, only until 1880 did the Japanese government accurately record the existence of Ulleungdo\u2019s \u201cneighbour islands.\nThus during the investigation into Takeshima around 1878 the Japanese compared Korean maps and documents and some made the natural conclusion that Usando was Matsushima (Dokdo) This makes sense when you compare the Korean maps to Japanese maps.\nNot only that when Anyongbok protested Japanese fishing on Ulleungdo he clearly stated \u201cJasando (Usando) was Matsushima (Dokdo)\u201d This incident would leave an indelible impression on the territorial perceptions of both Koreans and Japanese for centuries thereafter.\nOn page 5 of the Anyongbok report found in the archives of the Murakawa family of Shimane Prefecture it was stated \u201cJasando is Matsushima\u201d It was said to be in the middle of the North Sea and part of Kangwan Province.\nTo the Japanese this would have only meant one island-Dokdo. This is because in 1667 the Japanese document Onshu-shicho-goki also recorded and two islands in the North Sea called Takeshima and Matushima.\nThe Japanese viewed many maps and documents to arrive at a general consensus about the East Sea, the most basic principle they relied on was two islands existed in the east sea and they followed this rule often with blind conviction.\nToadface, you have yet to show me even one Korean or Japanese map that shows \u201cUsando\u201d as Liancourt Rocks. I, on the other hand, have shown you several Korean and Japanese maps that show \u201cUsando\u201d as a neighboring island of Ulleungdo.\n\u5d69(Kasa) means height and size of piled thing, or Volume, capacity, and weight.\nGenerally, it doesn\u2019t use it to describe a huge thing.\nWhen the big mountain and the ranging of it are described, \u5cb3 or \u5dbd is handled.\nThough I do not percice an English nuance easily,bulkness(ly) or thik(ly) or luxuriant(ly) may have same nuance.\n\u5f13(yumi) means bow.\nSo, The outline of the island may be seen like thick, tall a little, arc of the bended bow from a distance.\nThis is only a my imagination.\nMaybe the Korean concept of \u5d69 is different from the Japanese?\nNot only that when Anyongbok protested Japanese fishing on Ulleungdo he clearly stated \u201cJasando (Usando) was Matsushima (Dokdo)\u201d.\nThe word in the second parentheses is only your imagination and not right.\nNot only that when Anyongbok protested Japanese fishing on Ulleungdo he clearly stated \u201c<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "Since Dokdo first appeared in history of Korea with Shilla's conquest ofUsanguk approximately 1,500 years ago, the island has belonged to Korea as part of Ulleungdo. 'History and Future Zone' introduces the history of Dokdo from its first appearance to today including the Japanese colonial and post-liberation periods, and exhibits materials explaining the importance of Dokdo in terms of marine resources.\nIn August 1947, the government's Dokdo Survey Team, together with the civilian Joseon Alpine Club (now Korean Alpine Club), conducted the \"Comprehensive Scientific Study of Ulluengdo and Dokdo\" to survey Dokdo's land, soil, andgeology, as well as the vegetation and ecology.\nSuch studies continued in 1952 and 1953. Natural science research has actively continued among government institutions, including the Central Fisheries Experiment Station; National Fisheries Research & Development Agency; Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (before 2000); Ministry of Land, Transportation and Maritime Affairs; National Fisheries Research and Development Institute; Ministry of Environment; Cultural Heritage Administration; Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries; and Korean Ocean Research and Development Institute (after 2000). In the Nature Zone, these results are presented through a model of Dokdo made on a 1/120 scale in \"Dokdo's Climate,\" \"Dokdo's Geography and Geology: Various Landforms and Soil Created by Volcanic Activity,\" and \"Dokdo's Ecology and Environment.\"\nIn the 4D Theater you can experience the topography, soil, ocean physics and ecology of Dokdo through a motion-based 4D simulation.\nThe film played in this theater, \"Dokdo, the Living Heart of the East Sea\" was provided by the East Sea Research Center (East Sea branch of the Korea Institute of Ocean Science & Technology), and produced in 2011 with the latest technology contributing to its research since 2006.\nIn this film, objective, scientific data from various studies of Dokdo was taken to create a 3D topography of Dokdo. The beautiful and majestic scenery of Dokdo, as well as various locations and facilities were sought to be presented in its realistic form, in addition to the representative animals and plants that add life and vitality to the image of Dokdo.\nFurthermore, the topography of the seabed surrounding Dokdo was visualized, as well as the marine organisms and their environments, including plant and animal plankton, fish, and seaweed. The physical characteristics of water such as the seasonal changes in temperatures, the flow of water, cold and warm underwater cyclones, the Dokdo effect, and the deep sea current have also been visualized in 3D form to increase understanding.\n\"Dokdo looks different every time I see it. It has a thousand faces. It is different from last year and every season. It is like a handsome bauxite rock in nature. It is a beautiful creation of God perfectly combined with a profound and mysterious nature.\"\nThe Dokdo paintings in the Exhibition are the works of Lee Jong Sang, who is a respected artist in Koreancontemporary art and a member of the National Academy of Arts. He first painted Dokdo in 1977, and has actively participated in NGO activities, including \"Spreading Culture to Dokdo\" and \"Preserving the Culture of Goguryo,\" for nearly 40 years.\nHis light-colored ink paintings expressing Dokdo and the sea with two strokes vividly show the people's wishes for Dokdoin quiet contrast. He believes \"Dokdo is a magical island which becomes one or two,\" meaning that unlike other islands, Dokdo shows a new image of itself when he sketches it while sailing around the island. Lee, who is known as the first Dokdo painter, wants audiences to feel \"Dokdo with a thousand faces\" through his painting.\n81 TONGILRO (267 MIGEUN-DONG) LIMKWANG TOWER, SEODAEMUN-GU.

        "passage": "The map of the Korean peninsula shows Ulleungdo (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6) off the east coast with a small neighboring isand labeled \"\u4e8e\u5c71\" (Usan). Korea claims that the \"island of Usan\" (\u4e8e\u5c71\u5cf6) was the old Korean name for \"Dokdo\" (Liancourt Rocks), but this map, like many others, shows that Usando was a neighboring island of Ulleungdo, not Dokdo (\u7368\u5cf6). This is confirmed by the Gangwondo (\u6c5f\u539f\u9053) map that was included in the same atlas.\nThe Gangwondo map (LINK) shows a close-up of Ulleungdo with an island just off its east shore labeled \"\u4e8e\u5c71\u5cf6\" (Usando). We know that the Usando on this map was not \"Dokdo\" because Dokdo is ninety-two kilometers southeast of Ulleungdo and is essentially made up of two islets, not one. The maps also shows Ulleungdo with five other small islands just off its southern shore, which was a common feature of Korea's old Ulleungdo maps.\nThe writing below Ulleungdo gives the dimensions of the island (80 ri east to west & 50 ri north to south) and the flora and fauna found there. It also says that Ulleungdo was two days away by boat from Uljin (\u851a\u73cd), which is a place on the Korean peninsula.\nI hope they will adopt this map for the new Korean banknote!\nThis is another evidence to show that Usando was not Liancourt rocks.\nNow we have lots of evidences...\nKorea didn't know Liancourt rocks, old documents and maps show it and Korean eastern territory didn't include Liancourt rocks from 1894 to 1948. Then, how Korea can keep insisting that they have right to own Liancourt rocks?\nJust ask a question, how to judge this map was published before 1800?.\nThe full chosun map resemble to \u6d77\u5de6\u5168\u5716 on 1823 and Local map of \u6c5f\u539f\u9053,incruding detail map of Ulluengdo seems to be \u671d\u9bae\u5730\u57161898/\u6c5f\u539f\u9053\u5716 on \u5927\u97d3\u5730\u8a8c1899.\nI have no idea when it was made, but I guess \"\u5c71\u5ddd\" simply means \"mountains and rivers\" which depicted precisely and labeled intensively. I don't know what \"\u6771\u4eac\" means in Korean, though.\none wonder about the title cover.\nUsually they wrote just a map title name only.\nFor e.g. \u9752\u90b1\u5716,\u6d77\u6771\u8f3f\u5730\u5716,\u6771\u8f3f\u5716 and so on.\nBut This map name might be \u300c\u516b\u9053\u5730\u5716\u300d,and \u6771\u4eac\u5c71\u5ddd doesnt seems to be map name itself.\nIn addition, I felt strange that \u6c5f\u539f\u9053\u5716 with Detail Ulleungdo map, they wrote Chinese letter bit dirty.\nIt does look like \"0\"s. Good find!\nThere are no maps show the eastern border of Korea include Takeshima/ Dokto, 131-52E, even after tne World war. All of maps in Korea during late 19th century to after the World War descrived 130-54E which include Jukdo, several kilometers to the west of Ululundo.\nCheck your documents in Korea.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "My question is where do you live and what would you recommend about it? What do you dislike about it?\nI live on an island called Namhae-gun.\nNamhae is very rural and beautiful. I am in sight of the sea from most locations. Its historic and offers a few temples, museums, dinosaur fossil footprints. the weather is cold in the winter, pleasant in the summer. (if you can handle humidity). January is the coldest month. I think last year it was -5 but I was told it was the coldest winter in a hundred years. The water pipes froze in the shower. I'm hoping this winter will not be so cold. Spring and fall are gorgeous. If people like night life, they probably won't find it here in Namhae, though the crime rate is low. The people are nice and friendly. One time I was trying to turn around in a narrow spot and (thanks to the give on my clutch) I pulled right into the drainage ditch. a farmer in a little truck came along, tied a rope around my axle and pulled me out in nothing flat. I shudder to think what my insurance would have said! or long it would have taken to get a response. People often park their cars in awkward places blocking other vehicles and they leave their keys in the ignition so if the vehicle is in your way, you can move it. I also get a glimpse of the culture as I see neighbors beekeeping or farming the rice fields. I think Namhae is a pleasant place to live.\nI live on Mireuk island in Tongyeong. The island is really close to the mainland, accessible by an underwater pedestrian tunnel built by the Japanese in the 30's and two bridges. The sea breeze has been a nice, unexpected benefit - at the most random times while walking you will smell the sea and even in the heat of the summer there was a breeze to be found.\nIt is definitely a more rural area overall than Gyeonggi-do (where I had been previously), but I find the local culture's treatment of foreigners much easier to handle than when I was near Seoul. The area is much more diverse due to the shipbuilding industry here and on Geoje Island and people do not seem to flinch as much at foreigners. It is funny that though there is a thread going here debating whether Seoul has too many foreigners, I found people in Seoul to be much more awkward and pushy even though one might expect they would be more cautious and tolerant given the local diversity.\nRusty! great idea. if the schools would support a teacher exchange program.... the teachers could meet up and exchange houses during the school holidays and teach the school holiday classes and camp. that would be great. Changwon is my closest, best bookstore, so I've been there a few times. big city to me.\nteachermc, you've inspired a desire to see Mireuk and this pedestrian underwater bridge. thanks for sharing.\nI live in Byeongjeom all the way South on Line 1. It's a rather nondescript Korean area. The buildings are battleship gray to match the skies in the winter. The usual suspects are here such as Lotteria, Lotte Cinema, Caffe Benne, etc. It is nice and shiny and night, Vegas on a miniaturized scale. There's a nice park. Best thing about the area is that we have three buses that go to Seoul from here which will arrive in an hour at most unless there's terrible traffic. I also don't work here either. I take the bus into Dongtan every day which is a much nicer and richer area.\nI live near the bus terminal in Incheon. I love and hate it. I am near downtown Incheon, but there is not much to do. Usually, everyone goes to Seoul for the fun. Seoul is only and hour away, so it is nice. It has its pros and it has its cons. I can avoid the hustle and bustle of Seoul, but I can visit from time to time. If I go out to part in Seoul, I have to pay to get back, stay there, or go out all night. It is nice not seeing tons of westerners here. I can go a week without seeing one, at least the obvious ones.\nI live in Wontong, which is about 10 minutes away from Inje (which is about an hour from Chuncheon).\nWow, Rusty, never knew you were a fellow Changwonite. I'm on the outskirts of Changwon (Naeseo-eup)...kinda out in the sticks, but not really...20 minute bike/bus ride to Masan, 50 min bike/bus ride to downtown Changwon, and yet within another 1/2 hr to an hour of riding I'm way out lost in the country...sort of the best of both worlds, just sucks for hanging out with friends at night...taxis add up and buses stop running after about 11:30.\nNice neighborhood in Seoul with no foreigners. \nNamwon, in Jellabuk-do. Nice quiet town. Kind of a rural town, but has all the regular stuff of a city. Reminds me a lot of the small university towns in the US.\nRelatively working class area of northern seoul, stuck in a small one room in a 'Villa' with many of the other local NET teachers. They are loud in the hallways and the NET above me regular makes a hell of a racket (music, laughing, banging about).\nI live 10 mins from my school and my students live all around me. \nI live on the bottom floor and can hear when people type in the security code on the main entrance door.\nYeonsu-gu. Overall, Yeonsu-gu is the bee's knees.\nI live on Namhae too. As mentioned, it's rural, quiet and safe and the local Koreans are very friendly. I like it; I'm a small town kind of guy. I've lived in 3 big cities and been to a heck of a lot more; they're all the same: noisy, pushy, busy and loud. A nice place to visit but not a place to live, at least for me.\nI live in Sinjeong dong. In Seoul. A nice area, but away from popular areas.\nI'm also in Changwon. Kind of crazy that there are this many of us on here.\nI'm liking the city. I'm blonde, so I still get stared at, but it's not too bad since there are lots of foreigners around.\nI'm teaching over near City 7, which is probably one of the prettiest building complexes in all of Korea.\nIt's a pretty good place, especially to me, coming from a small town in the Florida.\nI've seen city 7 from the outside and a few pictures on the internet of the inside, and it is gorgeous. I've been wanting to go there, but just haven't taken the time to do it yet.\nI just got into Daegu, the Northern section of city where the subway doesn't extend yet in the 7th something.\nI live in Bucheon. Used to live in a still-developing part of Incheon so this was definitely a step up. If I stay long enough, Seoul line 7 will pass under my street, which would be really awesome. There are nice parks to take your bike, lots of shopping, restaurants, and two big foreigner bars all within walking distance. The foreigner population took a hit when gepik went belly up for the year, but they're still fairly common. To be fair, I haven't really explored much so I reckon my observations only scratch the surface.\nI live in Pohang, Gyeongbukdo. If you look on a map of Korea, Pohang is that little horn on the east coast. If you want to go to Ulleungdo, Pohang is the main ferry terminus there, albeit we're not the only one. We're about 90 mins from Busan and Daeg<|endoftext|>"

They inspected only the exterior of the island, which has led to these evil practices.\nNotice that King Kojong and Lee Gyu-won disagreed on the number of Ulleungdo's neighboring islands. King Kojong said there were two, but Lee said there was only one. The king said \"Songjukdo\" (\u677e\u7af9\u5cf6) and \"Usando\" (\u828b\u5c71\u5cf6) were neighboring islands of Ulleungdo, but Lee said that Usando was just another name for Ulleungdo and that Songjukdo was the only neighboring island. King Kojong persisted and said that the names \"Songdo\" (\u677e\u5cf6) and \"Jukdo\" (\u7af9\u5cf6) were also used and that together with Usando, three islands made up what was called Ulleungdo. Lee Gyu-won, however, did not concede to the king and said that even though some people had said that \"Songdo\" and \"Jukdo\" were east of Ulleungdo, there was only one island, Songjukdo, not a separate Songdo and Jukdo.\nEven though he seemed unsure of their names, King Kojong seemed sure that three islands made up Ulleungdo. When Lee Gyu-won said that Songjukdo was Ulleungdo's only neighboring island and that Usando was just the old name for Ulleungdo, the king seemed to suggest that Songjukdo (\u677e\u7af9\u5cf6) could be two separate islands, Songdo (\u677e\u5cf6) and Jukdo (\u7af9\u5cf6), and that if Usando (\u828b\u5c71\u5cf6) were just another name for Ulleungdo, then that would still mean that Ulleungdo was made up of three islands. Lee Gyu-won, however, rejected that theory and said that Ulleungdo had only one neighboring island, \"Songjukdo.\"\nLee Gyu-won said that Songjukdo was \"three to ten ri\" (\u4e09\u6578\u5341\u91cc) offshore of Ulleungdo, which is 1.2 to 4 kilometers (1 Korean ri = 0.4 km). Ulleungdo's neighboring island of Jukdo (\u7af9\u5cf6) is approximately 2 kilometers off Ulleungdo's northeast shore and 4 kilomethers off its southeast shore. That means that in 1882 Ulleungdo's neighboring island of Jukdo was being referred to as \"Songjukdo\" (\u677e\u7af9\u5cf6), \"Songdo\" (\u677e\u5cf6), and \"Jukdo\" (\u7af9\u5cf6).\nSome \"Dokdo\" advocates have suggested that Songjukdo was \"Dokdo\" (Liancourt Rocks), but ; Liancourt Rocks is approximately ninety kilometers southeast of Ulleungdo, not 1.2 to 4 kilometers. Also, Lee said Songjukdo had juniper and pipestem bamboo on it, which would eliminate any possibility that Songjukdo was Liancourt Rocks since Liancourt Rocks were just barren rocks with no soil to grow juniper or bamboo.\nThe conversation between King Kojong and Inspector Lee Gyu-won shows quite clearly that, in 1882, even Korea's king and his advisors were unsure of the geography of Ulleungdo. Korea's maps showed Usando to be Ulleungdo's neighboring island of Jukdo, but Korean documents, including the Yeojiseungram (\u8f3f\u5730\u52dd\u89bd) mentioned above, apparently also showed Songjukdo (\u677e\u7af9\u5cf6) as a neighboring island. Also, a secret Japanese mission to Korean in 1869 reported in an 1870 document HERE that Ulleungdo had a neighboring island called \"Matsushima\" (\u677e\u5cf6 = Songdo), which was an island the Japanese had no record of. Before that, in 1794, Ulleungdo Inspector Sim Jin-hyeon (\u6c88\u6649\u8ce2) reported that Ulleungdo had a neighboring island called Jukdo (\u7af9\u5cf6), but did not mention either Usando or Songdo in his report.\nWhen Lee Gyu-won conducted his inspection of Ulleungdo in 1882, he found two islands: Jukdo (\u7af9\u5cf6) and Dohang (\u5cf6\u9805). His map of Ulleungdo showed that Jukdo was almost certainly Ulleungdo's present-day neighboring island of Jukdo (\u7af9\u5cf6), and Dohang was Ulleungdo's Gwaneumdo (\u89c0\u97f3\u5cf6). He reported that he could find no islands named \"Songjukdo\" or \"Usando\" and concluded that Usando was just another name from Ulleungdo. Neither King Kojong nor Lee Gyu-won showed any clue that they knew Liancourt Rocks even existed.\nWhy aren't there any Korean maps that show either Usando, Songjukdo, Songdo, or Jukdo together? The most logical explanation is that they were four different names for the same island. \"Songjukdo\" (\u677e\u7af9\u5cf6) was obviously a combination of two names--\"Songdo\" (\u677e\u5cf6) and \"Jukdo\" (\u7af9\u5cf6)--both of which were names that were mentioned during the territorial dispute between Korea and Japan in the 1690s. Then, Korea claimed that Jukdo (\u7af9\u5cf6) was an alternate name for Ulleungdo that Korean fishermen used, and An Yong-bok had claimed that the Japanese name for Usando was \"Matsushima\" (\u677e\u5cf6 = Songdo). Since Korean maps showed Usando to be Ulleungdo's neighboring island of Jukdo, it was almost inevitable that some would start using Songdo (\u677e\u5cf6) to refer to Ulleungdo's neighboring island of Jukdo. Even in 1899, the Korean newspaper Hwangseong Sinmun (\u7687\u57ce\u65b0\u805e) reported that Ulleungdo's most prominent neighboring island was \"Usando/Jukdo\" (\u4e8e\u5c71\u5cf6\u7af9\u5cf6), which was most likely written to show that there were two names for the same island. If the \"Usando/Jukdo\" in the 1899 article meant two separate islands, as some claim, then why was only Jukdo, not Usando, mentioned one year later in Korea's Imperial Edict 41, which upgraded Ulleungdo's status to a county?\nIn September 1904, the Japanese naval vessel Niitaka (\u65b0\u9ad8\u4e38) was visiting Ulleungdo as part of its mission to lay telegraph cable between Ulleungdo and the Korean port of Jukpyeon (\u7af9\u908a), which was near Uljin on the Korean peninsula. In the September 25 entry in the ship's log, it was recorded that a Japanese civilian staying on Ulleungdo had personally visited Liancourt Rocks, which he said was written as \"Dokdo\" (\u7368\u5cf6) by Koreans and was called \"Riangko-shima\" by Japanese fishermen. He said that there was a certain amount of fresh water on Ulleungdo. He also said that the people from Ulleungdo who hunted sea lions on Liancourt Rocks used Japanese ships, which means that if any Koreans were among those doing the hunting, they would have been working for the Japanese.\nRegardless of what Korean Web sites may say or imply, this was the first time that the name \"Dokdo\" (\u7368\u5cf6) had ever been used to refer to Liancourt Rocks. The year before, in 1903, it was recorded that Korean fishermen were using the Japanese name to refer to Liancourt Rocks, which suggests that Koreans had just recently learned of the rocks. There are no maps or reliable records to suggest that Koreans ever traveled to Liancourt Rocks before 1903.\nLiancourt Rocks is written as \"Dokdo\" (\u7368\u5cf6) by Koreans and is called \"Riangko-shima\" by the fishermen of our country. As can be seen on the attached map, it is made up of two rock islets. The west islet is about 400 feet high and has a slope so steep that it would be difficult to climb; however, the east island is relatively low and has weeds growing on it. He said that the land on top is a little flat, so it would be suitable for buidling two or three small huts.\nA small amount of fresh water can be gotten from a hollow on the east shore of the east island. On the south side of this island, at point \"B,\" there is a spring about three ken (5.5 meters) above sea level where water flows down toward the west. There is so much of it that it flows throughout the year. On the west side of the west island, at point \"C,\" there is also clear water.\nThe scattered rocks around the islets are generally flat, and the larger ones are big enough to spread out dozens of tattami. They are always above the surface of the water, and sea lions gather there. The space between the<|endoftext|>"

Higher magnitude of rank correlations indicated that the ranking of buffaloes based on their genetic persistency in both methods were similar for evaluation of genetic persistency of buffaloes. Based on the estimated range of genetic persistency three types of genetic persistency were identified. Genetic correlations among genetic persistency in different days in milk and between genetic persistencies on the same day in milk were very high. The genetic correlations between genetic persistency for different days in milk and estimated breeding value for 305 DIM was increased from 90 DIM to 180 DIM, and highest around 240 DIM which indicates a minimum of 240 days as an optimum first lactation length might be required for genetic evaluation of Indian Murrah buffaloes.\nFourteen Acer pseudosieboldianum populations in South Korea were used to estimate genetic diversity, genetic differentiation and genetic relationships using seven AFLP primer combinations. The average of effective alleles ($A_e$), the proportion of polymorphic loci (%P) and Shannon's diversity index (I) was 1.4, 82.2% and 0.358, respectively. The expected heterozygosity ($H_e$) under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was 0.231 and the expected heterozygosity (Hj) from Bayesian inference was 0.253. The level of genetic diversity was moderate compared to those of Genus Acer and lower than those of other species having similar ecological niche and life history. The inbreeding coefficient within populations ($F_{IS}$) from Bayesian method was 0.712 and it could be influenced by selfing or biparental inbreeding to induce homozygote excess. The level of genetic differentiation was 0.107 from AMOVA (${\\Phi}_{ST}$) and 0.110 from Bayesian method (${\\Phi}^{II}$). The genetic differentiation was lower than those of other species having similar ecological niche and life history. Ulleungdo population had the lowest level of genetic diversity and was genetically the most distinct population from others in the study. We consider that founder effect and genetic drift might be occurred to reduce genetic diversity and then the geographical isolation might interrupt gene flow to aggravate it.\nArora, R.;Bhatia, S.\nGenetic variability is an important component in the ability of populations to adapt in the face of environmental change. Severe human impacts reduced Muzzafarnagri sheep of India from 500,000 in 1972 to 10,989 in 1973-74. Here we report for the first time the effect of this population decline on levels of genetic variability at 13 FAO recommended ovine microsatellite loci and contrast levels of variability to that in a breed from the same geographical region, which differed in numbers, by an order of magnitude (Marwari sheep). Of the 13 loci, 100% were polymorphic in both breeds. A high degree of genetic variation was observed within populations in terms of both allele diversity (number of alleles per locus, >4) and gene diversity (expected heterozygosity, >0.5), which implied that there is still a substantial amount of genetic diversity at the nuclear loci in a declining population. Nevertheless, overall low number of alleles per locus and relatively less abundance of low frequency alleles in Muzzafarnagri sheep suggested that genetic variability has been comparatively reduced in this population. Bottleneck analysis indicated that a genetic bottleneck did not occur during the most recent decline. In addition, we found that the differentiation among populations was moderate ($F_{ST}$= 11.8%). This study on assessment of genetic effects of the population declines in ovines is a step towards identification of genetically impoverished or healthy populations, which could prove to be a useful tool to facilitate conservation planning in this important species of small ruminants.\nGenetic knowledge for oncology nurses is important in Korea because oncologists are incorporating genetic counseling and genetic testing into their practice. The purpose of this paper is to describe our method of developing the first academic cancer genetic risk assessment and counseling course for Korean nurses. A one-week (non-credit) cancer genetics counseling program was constructed for master's level Korean oncology nurses. The course emphasized basic genetic concepts and principles the genetics of cancer; hereditary cancer syndromes; family history assessments; pedigree construction; risk calculation; surveillance recommendations and treatment options ethical, legal, social, and psychological issues inherent in genetic testing. The goals of this program are to: 1) provide a comprehensive knowledge base for nurses who are currently expanding their scope of practice into the genetic counseling role 2) introduce this knowledge to nurses who want to use it in their practice; and 3) provide cancer genetic knowledge and resources to Korean nursing faculty who plan to incorporate this knowledge into existing master's courses. This academically-based course is recognized as valuable by nurses, nursing faculty, and physicians. With this new knowledge nurses can begin toexpand their role in delivering comprehensive cancer care services.\nPurpose: The purpose of this review article is to introduce how the Korean Society of Genetic Nursing (KSGN) has evolved and tried to translate genomic knowledge to nursing practice, and then to suggest the future role of genetic nurses in Korea. Methods: A literature review was performed and the current status of genetic counselling in Korea was explored. Then the educational and clinical experiences of the authors were incorporated. Finally, the main activities of Korean nursing for genetics were identified. Results: Two types of genetic counsellor certification have been issued in Korea: one is issued by the Korean Society of Genetic Medicine, another by the Korean Society of Breast Cancer since June 2011. A few Korean nursing researchers have continuously performed research related to genetic nursing and undertook several research projects funded by the government since 2003. In February 2011, KSGN was established and is now trying to establish further international networks. Conclusion: Nursing genetic experts should be trained to integrate all specialties for genetic counselling, so they can provide holistic genetic services including ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI).\nCornus controversa is a long-lived woody species mostly distributed in East Asia. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were used to investigate the genetic diversity and population structure of Korean populations of this species. A high level of genetic variation was found in seven populations of C. controversa. The mean genetic diversity (H) was 0.222 across populations, varying from 0.200 to 0.238. Eighty of the 93 loci (86.0%) showed detectable polymorphism in at least one population. Total genetic diversity values ($H_T$) varied between 0.192 and 0.231, giving an average overall polymorphic loci of 0.212. The interlocus variation of genetic diversity within populations ($H_S$) was high (0.167). Mean of genetic diversity in C. controversa was higher than average values for species with similar life history traits. The sexual reproduction, perennial habitat, and longevity are proposed as possible factors contributing to high genetic diversity. On a per locus basis, the proportion of total genetic variation due to differences among populations ($G_{ST}$) ranged from 0.169 to 0.278 with a mean of 0.216, indicating that about 21.6% of the total genetic variation was among populations. An indirect estimate of the number of migrants per generation (Nm=1.893) indicated that gene flow was extensive among Korean populations of C. controversa.\nIn order to develop specific genetic markers and determine the genetic diversity of Bangladeshi native cattle (Pabna, Red Chittagong) and exotic breeds (Sahiwal), randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was performed using 12 primers. Genomic DNA was extracted from 20 cattle (local and exotic) blood samples and extracted DNA was observed by gel electrophoresis. Among the random primers three were matched and found to be polymorphic. Genetic relations between cattle's were determined by RAPD polymorphisms from a total of 66.67%. Statistical analysis of the data, estimating the genetic distances between cattle and sketching the cluster trees were estimated by using MEGA 5.05 software. Comparatively highest genetic distance (0.834) was found between RCC-82 and SL-623. The lowest genetic distance (0.031) was observed between M-1222 and M-5730. The genetic diversity of Red Chittagong and Sahiwal cattle was relatively higher for a prescribed breed. Adequate diversity in performance and adaptability can be exploited from the study results for actual improvement accruing to conservation and development of indigenous cattle resources.\nDilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most common cause of heart failure in young adults and up to 50% of idiopathic DCM is thought to be caused by genetic mutations in candidate genes. Although a genetic diagnosis can confirm a clinical diagnosis of hereditary DCM, genetic testing has not been easily accessible due to genetic heterogeneity and complexity. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have recently been introduced, and genetic testing for multiple genes is currently available and more than 40 different genes have been associated with DCM. In Korea, the government has supported genetic diagnosis for patients with idiopathic DCM. When a targeted gene panel with NGS technology was used, the detection rate was about 40%. MYBPC3, LMNA, and MYH7 were the most frequently identified genes, and the pattern of causative genes was different from previous reports. In the analysis, a significant number of subjects (42.0%) had rare or novel unspecified variants in DCM candidate genes, which should be assessed as potential causative mutations. Developing a more comprehensive test panel with additional DCM genes and whole exome sequencing will improve the detection rate, and allow genetic testing to be an<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u20131905. The squadron was intercepted by the Japanese fleet in May 1905 in the Battle of Tsushima after a lengthy voyage from the Baltic. The cruiser was not seriously damaged during the initial fighting and tried to continue on to Vladivostok after the first day's fighting. She was spotted by several groups of Japanese warships the following day and was badly damaged in the resulting combat. Her captain ordered the crew ashore near Ulleungdo and had \"Dmitrii Donskoi\" scuttled offshore.\nDesign and description.\n\"Dmitrii Donskoi\" was classified as a semi-armoured frigate and was an improved version of her half-sister. The ship was designed with long endurance and high speed to facilitate her role as a commerce raider. She was laid out as a central-battery ironclad with her armament concentrated amidships. The iron-hulled ship was fitted with a ram and was sheathed in wood and copper to reduce fouling. Her crew numbered approximately 550 officers and men.\nThe ship was long overall. She had a beam of and a draught of. The ship displaced at deep load. \"Dmitrii Donskoi\" had a pair of three-cylinder compound steam engines driving a single propeller shaft. Steam was provided by eight cylindrical boilers. The engines were designed to produce, but produced during sea trials which gave the ship a maximum speed around. The ship normally carried of coal which gave her an economical range of at a speed of, but she is known to have loaded in May 1889. She was ship rigged with three masts and had a total sail area of. To reduce drag while under sail, her funnels were retractable. The highest speed that she made solely under sail was.\n\"Dmitrii Donskoi\" was armed with two 30-calibre Model 1877 guns, on sponsons on the upper deck between the funnels. The fourteen 28-calibre Model 1877 guns were mounted in casemates on the main deck. Anti-torpedo boat defence was provided by a number of nine-pounder (), four-pounder () and five-barreled revolver Hotchkiss guns. The ship was also equipped with four above-water torpedo tubes.\nThe ship's waterline belt was composed of compound armour and extended the full length of the ship. It was six inches thick amidships, but reduced to at the ship's ends. It extended above the waterline and below. Transverse bulkheads thick protected the guns in the battery from raking fire. The sponsons of the 8-inch guns were equally thick. The protective deck was thick.\nService.\nConstruction began on \"Dmitrii Donskoi\" on 22 September 1880, at the New Admiralty Shipyard in St. Petersburg, and the keel-laying ceremony was held on 21 May 1881. She was launched on 30 August 1882 and completed in early 1885. The ship's total cost was 3,421,468 rubles. She was named after Dmitry Donskoy, Grand Duke of Moscow.\nShe sailed to the Mediterranean on 8 August 1885 and remained there until she arrived at Port Said on 6 March 1887 en route to the Far East. \"Dmitrii Donskoi\" reached Nagasaki, Japan, on 19 May and remained in Japanese waters for several months. The ship arrived at Vladivostok on 20 July and accidentally grounded on 12 October whilst conducting torpedo practice. Only lightly damaged, she was refloated the following day. \"Dmitrii Donskoi\" wintered in Japan that year and made port visits to Chefoo and Shanghai in February 1888. She was refitted in Yokohama before she began her return to the Baltic on 20 January 1889. The ship was inspected by Tsar Alexander III after her arrival at Kronstadt on 12 June. She began a lengthy overhaul in preparation for her next foreign cruise shortly afterwards.\n\"Dmitrii Donskoi\" began her second foreign cruise on 3 October 1891 when she sailed for the Mediterranean, visiting Brest, France en route. She was reclassified as a cruiser of the first rank on 13 February 1892 and remained in the Mediterranean for another month or so. The ship reached Vladivostok on 29 June, stopping at Aden, Singapore, and Hong Kong en route. \"Dmitrii Donskoi\" served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Tirtov several times during the year. She spent the winter in Yokosuka and Nagasaki before she sailed in early 1893 to America for a goodwill visit to mark the 400th anniversary of America's discovery. In Algiers in March, the ship picked up Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia and became flagship of Rear Admiral Kaznakov who commanded all the Russian ships at the exhibition. \"Dmitrii Donskoi\" reached New York City on 25 April and participated in the Presidential Review two days later. She made port visits to Philadelphia, Boston and Newport, Rhode Island before she arrived back at Kronstadt in early September.\nDuring the ship's lengthy 1893\u201395 refit, she was rearmed with six 45-calibre six-inch guns, ten 45-calibre guns, and six guns. Her boilers may have been replaced at this time and her sailing rig was replaced by three pole masts. Wilgelm Vitgeft was appointed as the ship's captain in late 1895 and \"Dmitrii Donskoi\" began her voyage to the Far East on 10 November. She was one of the Russian ships that occupied Port Arthur in March 1898 and participated in suppressing the Boxer Rebellion in mid-1900. The ship was ordered home in late 1901. \"Dmitrii Donskoi\" was refitted again upon her arrival and six of her 4.7-inch guns were replaced by six guns and two additional 47\u00a0mm guns.\nAfter the completion of her refit, she escorted a group of seven destroyers and five torpedo boats to the Mediterranean in October 1903 where they were assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron under the command of Rear Admiral Virenius. The Naval Staff decided to reinforce the Pacific Squadron with the Mediterranean Squadron in December, but its departure was delayed by repairs to the battleship after it had grounded. When the Russo-Japanese War began in February 1904, the squadron was in the Red Sea and was recalled to the Baltic lest it be caught and destroyed en route by the Japanese.\nSinking.\n\"Dmitrii Donskoi\" was assigned to the cruiser force of the Second Pacific Squadron and departed Libau on 15 October 1904 bound for Vladivostok with Captain 1st Rank Lebedev in command. En route in the North Sea, she was damaged by friendly fire from seven sister ships in mistake for a Japanese vessel during the Dogger Bank Incident of 21/22 October. The ship passed the Cape of Good Hope on 20 December. Whilst approaching the Strait of Tsushima on 27 May 1905, the Russian force was intercepted by the Japanese in the Battle of Tsushima. The cruiser was assigned to defend the transport ships at the rear of the Russian formation and was not seriously engaged during the day.\nShe became separated from the rest of the fleet during the early evening and attempted to steam north to Vladivostok through the Japanese fleet. \"Dmitrii Donskoi\" was unsuccessfully attacked by Japanese destroyers and torpedo boats during the night. The following morning, she helped to transfer the badly wounded squadron commander, Vice Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky, from the destroyer to the destroyer \"Biedovi\" and then was forced to scuttle \"Buinyi\" when the destroyer's machinery broke down. The destroyer's crew as well as some 205 survivors from \"Oslyabya\" were transferred to the cruiser before \"Buinyi\" was scuttled.\nAs the ship sailed northward, she was spotted late in the day by several groups of Japanese ships and badly damaged in the ensuing combat. Captain Lebedev decided to run his ship aground on Ulleungdo, but the ship anchored instead and all of the men aboard were taken to the island. Roughly 60 men of the ship's crew had been killed and another 120 wounded during the fighting. The next morning, 29 May, \"Dmitrii Donskoi\" was scuttled about a mile and a half (2.4\u00a0km) offshore at approximately. The survivors were taken prisoner that afternoon by landing parties from the destroyer and the armed merchant cruiser \"Kasuga Maru\".\nShipwreck.\nIn 2000, the Korea Ocean Research and Development Institute, contracted in 1999 by Dong Ah Construction Industrial Co., South Korea's fifth-largest construction company, was rumoured to have found the shipwreck of \"Dmitrii Donskoi\". A month beforehand, the company had gone into receivership, but was allowed to continue trading shares. Its share price rose by 41% in one week on media reports that 14,000 tons of gold (10% of all the gold ever mined on Earth) were on board the ship, but they never raised anything from the sea, and the company went bankrupt.\nSouth Korea's Institute of Ocean Science and Technology claims to have discovered the wreck in 2003 and has photographs dating from 2007 on its website.\nShinil Group.\nIn July 2018, the Shinil Group, a South Korean treasure hunting company, announced it had found \"Dmitrii Donskoi\" below the surface, off the South Korean island of Ulleungdo.

        "passage": "Occidentalism \u00bb Blog Archive \u00bb Another Picture of \u201cDokdo\u201d from Ulleungdo?\nAnother Picture of \u201cDokdo\u201d from Ulleungdo?\nThe following picture of \u201cDokdo\u201d (Liancourt Rocks) was supposedly taken from Ulleungdo on January 15, 2007 with a Nikon D200 camera using a 70-300ED lens. It appears that you can see even the lighthouse on Dokdo, which is 92 kilometers southeast of Ulleungdo. Supposedly, even two mountain ridges near Samcheok City in Gangwon Province were also captured by the camera on the same day. The mountain ridges are between 130 and 150 kilometers away from Ulleungdo. Link to the Korean article.\nThe two islands of Usan and Mu-leung are due east of the present \u201chyeon\u201d (Uljin), and the distance between them is close enough that they are visible on a clear, windy day. In the time of Silla, they were called Unsan-guk or Ulleungdo.\nFinally, I would just like to remind people that Koreans back during the Joseon Dynasty did not have a Nikon camera with a zoom lens or a sign pointing in the direction of Dokdo. They also probably did not have the time and patience to sit on top of a mountain on Ulleungdo waiting to get a view of a ghost island that may appear only once in a blue moon.\nemprator, do you know from what elevation one is able to see Mount Clemente from San Diego?\nBad moon rising. We don\u2019t really need to determine whether or not Dokdo is visible from Ulleungdo when even Japanese records like the link I posted state it is true.\nFor what it is worth here are the sketches of Dokdo done by the Russian Navy in 1854. They are from different angles and distances. The top left image is Dokdo as seen from a distance of 6.5kms the bottom left is from 9.3kms and the top right is Dokdo Island as viewed from 26kms away. They were done from the naked eye and from sea level.\nCorrection the date of the map was 1857.\nIt took 40 days to this photograph with 500mm lens, according to the article on \u6bce\u65e5\u65b0\u805e at December 10, 1999.\nSure, the best way to verify Dokdo\u2019s visibility is to actually go to Ulleungdo. But Gerry-Bevers is wondering whether Dokdo is large enough to be seen from 92km away.\nThe link I got the quote from does not indicate the elvation from which San Clemente is visible. But if you\u2019re trying to relate that to Dokdo, I would think that elevation is important mostly because of line-of-sight.\nThat calculator seems to assume no refraction. This page on Distance to Horizon suggests that refraction extends the distance to apparent horizon, which would mean that the height required to see the whole of Dokdo is probably less than 700m.\nI\u2019m only trying to address the question of visibility. I don\u2019t see why so many people assume this photo is fake. If the capability of the camera is in question, someone familiar with the camera should calculate how many pixels Dokdo would take up in the picture if zoomed in all the way with the camera.\nIf your goal is to show Dokdo belongs to Korea or Japan, it\u2019s probably better to debate whether visibility is relevant to that issue.\n> Dokdo is/was not an inherent part of Japan since ancient times.\nTakeshima/Dokdo (Matsushima) was a part of Japan since early 17th century. Ulleungdo was also thought to be Japanese territory in the 17th century, as you can see in the Onsyu-Shicho-Gouki (1667) which clearly said that Ulleungdo was Japanese boundary. After Ulleungdo was returned to Korea in 1696, Takeshima/Dokdo remained in the Japanese territory.\n> I have about another dozen Shimane Prefecture maps that show the same.\nAs I\u2019ve written many times, a map without something doesn\u2019t mean anything although if a map with something clearly depicted, it will be a evidence to show that they knew it.\nJapan has accurate maps of Takeshima/Dokdo but Korea has none.\n> Pacifist are trying to claim that a military acquisition is a legitimate criteria for incorporating land!!\ntoadface, I didn\u2019t say it is legitimate to take one island brutally by force. Korea did it brutally and still keeps occupying it. You must remember that some Japanese fishermen were killed because of Korean violence, but in 1905 no Koreans were killed because there were no Koreans, they even didn\u2019t know about the island.\nJapan didn\u2019t take it brutally in 1905 because it was no man\u2019s land \u2013 at least Korea didn\u2019t know about the island until 1905. So Korea doesn\u2019t have a right to claim.\nIf you want to refute, why don\u2019t you bring the evidence to show that Korea knew it, used it or owned it before 1905?\nBut you haven\u2019t succeeded in it yet.\nIsn\u2019t it an essential thing if one country claim another country\u2019s land?\nFrom what I have read, if this picture was taken with a 500mm lens, then that means the image looks ten times bigger than it would look with the naked eye. Imagine an image one tenth the size of the one in the picture. It would be just a spot on the horizon. Not only that, it would be a spot that appears only when conditions are just right. If it took the photographer forty days waiting on a mountaintop to see that spot, even though he already knew which direction to point his camera, then how likely would it have been for Koreans trying to survive on Ulleungdo hundreds of years ago to have spotted that spot not knowing in which direction to look?\nIn 1882, Lee Gyu-won confirmed that Koreans did not know where \u201cDokdo\u201d was. He also went to the top of Ulleungdo\u2019s tallest mountain to look for islands on the horizon, but reported that he did not see \u201ceven a lump of dirt.\u201d Lee also confirmed that the Koreans living on Ulleungdo at the time also did not know where \u201cUsando\u201d (Dokdo) was. They had heard Usando was a neighboring island of Ulleungdo, but did not know its location.\nUsando was just another name for Jukdo, Ulleungdo\u2019s largest neighboring island, 2.2 kilometers off its northeast shore.\nThank you for the confirmation that Lee asked about Usan.

The aircraft carrier will be used to patrol the disputed territories in Dokdo/Ulleungdo and Sector 7 against Japanese naval activity.\n\nCompared to China, South Korea does not have island clusters in the East Sea or along the Jeju-Busan sea lane to establish effective A2/AD. Therefore, an aircraft carrier is the only effective option to establish local area supremacy. Theoretically, land based aircraft can also be used, but the reduced deployment time and the heightened operational activity that an aircraft carrier can provide will be an important advantage compared to ground based aircraft. This is the reason why China, the biggest proponent of A2/AD, is getting aircraft carriers.\n\nAs for, the SSN, it takes time to perfect nuclear submarine technology.

She definitely helped me and challenged me to be excellent at the craft. I remember her being sweet, and funny. I really respected her and loved her compassion, she totally had mother vibes lol and that was more helpful than she could know. My condolences.\nSo sorry to hear of your loss. To teach is to change a life forever. Frances was such a great teacher and she left a lasting impression on all that she met including myself. She was so knowledgeable in the field of television production. I pray the wonderful memories of her live on forever in the hearts of her family, friends, and the countless students she impacted in her 28 years at SU.\nFrances was a marvelous, talented friend to our family. We are certainly going to miss her. Our sincere condolences go to Mark and her family.\nBeloved friend. I miss you already.\nI had a TV production class as part of my Comms BA back in 1997. Although times and technology have changed I still use the skills that Dr. Kendall taught me today. I'm glad I was fortunate for her path to cross mine as I journeyed towards my future.\nWe are saddened to learn of the passing of Frances, but grateful for her service to our nation with the Peace Corps in South Korea.\nTo meet Frances one time was to have her as a life long friend. It is so sad that this wonderful gentle spirit left us too soon. I will miss her.\nDr.Kendall was one of the sweetest professors I had while at Salisbury and she showed how much she genuinely cared about her students. So extremely devistating and shocking to hear the news. I'm deepest condolences are with you.\n<|endoftext|>"

He convinced Nakai that Dokdo was a completely ownerless island, and that since Nakai, a Japanese national, was \"managing\" the island, he should ask the Japanese govt to incorporate Dokdo into Japan.\nBut was Nakai really \u201cliving on and managing\u201d the island?\nThe Japanese Navy surveyed Dokdo for the first time in Sept. 1904.\nAt the time, the Japanese warship Niitaka was building naval watchtowers and telegraph lines on Ulleungdo island.\nDuring this mission, the Niitaka surveyed Dokdo island for the first time.\nThey surveyed the island, and also asked the locals on Ulleungdo about Dokdo.\nThey learned that Koreans called the island \"Dokdo\", while Japanese called it \"Lianko\".\nThey learned that Korean and Japanese fishermen were fishing and catching sealions on Dokdo, but that the fishermen never stayed long on Dokdo. The environment was too harsh and there was no fresh water on Dokdo, so the fishermen stayed on Dokdo for about ten days at a time (and only in the summer). The fishermen always operated from Ulleungdo. Ulleungdo was their base.\nThe Niitaka also learned from the locals that Russian ships were sometimes visiting near Dokdo.\nThe ship reported all this to the Japanese Navy.\n(This was for obvious reasons. There was no drinkable water on Dokdo, so they had to bring all the water from Ulleungdo, the nearest island from Dokdo.\nFurthermore, Koreans were clearly aware of and visiting Dokdo at the time.\nAnd Nakai originally knew that Dokdo was a Korean island.\nWith the backing of Maki and Kimotsuki (both expansionist-minded officials), Nakai submitted his \"Request for Territorial Incorporation of Liancourt Island and Its Lease\" on September 29, 1904 to the Japanese Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nThe Ministry of Interior rejected his petition, because it knew that Dokdo was Korean territory.\n(Give me a break. When Shimane Prefecture inquired the Interior Ministry in Sept. 1876 concerning the ownership of Ulleungdo and Dokdo, the Interior Ministry carried out a five month-long thorough investigation into the matter, using all available documents and maps. They decided that the two islands 'had nothing to do with\" Japan. But just to make very sure, they inquired the Dajoukan, who also said that the two islands \"have nothing to do with\" Japan.\nSo, the Interior Ministry rejected Nakai's petition.\nAt the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Yamaza pushed hard to have Nakai\u2019s petition approved.\nYamaza said that \"The incorporation [of Dokdo] is urgent particularly under the present situation, and it is absolutely necessary and advisable to construct watchtowers and install wireless or submarine cable and keep watch on the hostile warships.\"\nYamaza and Japan's Foreign Minister, Komura Jutaro (who was also expansionist-minded), played key roles in having Nakai's request approved by the Japanese govt.\n\"Records from Japan\u2019s Russo~Japanese War (1904~1905) archives detail how Komura Jutaro received telegrams on an almost daily basis reporting the location of Russia\u2019s approaching Baltic Fleet.\nA mere two weeks before annexing Dokdo, Komura Jutaro was sent a message confirming Russia\u2019s Navy would be sailing through Dokdo\u2019s adjacent waters en-route to Vladivostok.\nTo help posture for the battle Komura Jutaro with the help of Admiral Kimotsuki surveyed Dokdo, annexed the island and then installed watchtowers there.\"\nIn 1904-1905, Japan was fighting the Russo-Japanese War. It was fighting naval battles with Russia in the Korea/East Sea region.\nAfter successfully engaging the Russia's Vladivostok fleet in August 1904, it was installing watch towers and telegraph lines in Ulleungdo and all along Korea's coasts.\nIn Sept 1904, while Japanese warship Niitaka was performing this mission, it initially surveyed Dokdo. (It also found that Russian warships were frequenting the area, and reported it to the Navy).\nThe Japanese Navy then performed a full survey of Dokdo and deemed it suitable for military use, and submitted a feasibility report for the construction of naval watchtowers and telegraph station on Dokdo to Admiral Kimotsuki on January 5th 1905.\nJapan then annexed Dokdo in Feb. 1905.\nSo, Nakai Yozaburo's request to lease Dokdo just happened to come at a really opportune time, for the Japanese govt.\nSome in the Japanese govt opposed the incorporation of Dokdo, believing that Dokdo was Korean territory.\nBut expansionist-minded politicians (including some right-wing nationalists) prevailed, and the Japanese govt decided to annex Dokdo.\n\"Shimane Prefecture did not inquire \"whether the two islands should be placed under their administration.\" Show me your evidence that it did.\"\nGerry, did you even look at that link I gave you?\nThe officials of geographical room of your ministry (the Ministry of Interior) made their rounds to our prefecture for registration of lands and inquired as the separate paper, Otsu #28, concerning the investigation of Takeshima which is located in the Sea of Japan.\nThis island was discovered during the Eiroku years (1558-1570) and the merchants in Yonago town, Houki County in our feudal clan, Oya Kyuemon and Murakawa ichibee made voyages to the island every year under the permission of the shogunate and brought back animals and vegetables to sell them in the mainland for 78 years from the 4th year of Genwa (1618) to the 8th year of Genroku (1695). There is a conclusive evidence for that and old documents and old letters were handed down to their descendants.\nWe first of all attach separate paper relating the history and a map herewith. We should investigate the whole island this time and note every detail of it, however it was not certain that it was under this prefecture\u2019s jurisdiction from the ancient times. And it is far as over 100-ri in the north sea and sea route is unclear and usual sailboats can\u2019t make round trips. So we would like to report the details from the documents which were handed down by those men Oya and Murakawa later.\nAnd as we guess it generally, it locates at the northwest direction of Oki county so it seems as it should be attached to the west area of San-in district, we would like to ask about depicting the island in the prefecture\u2019s map and registration of land. Please give us an order.\nToshimichi in the Ministry of Interior \"\nAs you can see, it says it right there in the title.\nShimane Prefecture wanted to register the two islands within their territory and depict them in their maps.\nBy the way, they kept mentioning Takeshima only.\nThe Interior Ministry only inquired about Takeshima island. So Shimane just talked about Takeshima island.\nInterior Ministry asked Shimane about Takeshima.\nShimane asked Interior Ministry about Takeshima and \"another island\".\nInterior Ministry investigated for five months, and came to conclusion that Takeshima and \"another island\" have nothing to do with Japan. But just to make sure, Interior Ministry asked Dajoukan about Takeshima and \"another island\".\nInterior Ministry receives order that Takeshima and \"another island\" have nothing to do with Japan, and orders Shimane not to register Takeshima and \"another island\" within their territory.\nNow, if \u201canother island\u201d was Matsushima, all this makes perfect sense.\nShimane asked Interior Ministry about Takeshima and \"unknown mysterious island\".\nInterior Ministry investigated for five months, and came to conclusion that Takeshima and \"unknown mysterious island\" have nothing to do with Japan. But just to make sure, Interior Ministry asked Dajoukan about Takeshima and \"unknown mysterious island\".\nInterior Ministry receives order that Takeshima and \"unknown mysterious island\" have nothing to do with Japan, and orders Shimane not to register Takeshima and \"unknown mysterious island\" within their territory.\nDoesn't this sound really silly to you?\nNakai knew that there is no evidence of Korean effective occupation. Your essay is contrary to the fact.\nThe essay of a fabrication site is unreliable. And the information of the site is old or he selected information for his desire. For example, he has ignored another Boggs memo and \u7af9\u5cf6\u7d4c\u55b6\u8005\u4e2d\u4e95\u990a\u4e09\u90ce\u6c0f\u7acb\u5fd7\u50b3. His essay contradict these materials.\nShow the original text or the image data of the material, if you want to discussion.\nThere are some pages at your website (www.dokdo-takeshima.com) that need some upkeep.\nThere are some non-working links.\nIn my previous post, I cited the following webpages which prove that Japan annexed Dokdo in 1905 purely for military reasons.\n(\"Who Was Nakai Yozaburo<|endoftext|>"

And his son, So Yoshitsugu\uff08\u5b97\u7fa9\u502b\uff09, had died long before Ahn came \u2013 he died of illness on 27th of September 1694. So Yoshizane couldn\u2019t plead with Ahn to save his \u201cdead\u201d son from death penalty.\n(4) Ahn disguised as a tax official of Ulleungdo and Usando. If he believed that Usando was Matsushima, then the island should be inhabitable island because uninhabited island won\u2019t produce the need of tax. It is natural to think that the Matsushima in Ahn Yong-bok\u2019s imagination was not the Liancourt rocks.\n(5) Ahn told about 15 Japanese who crossed the border, but there is no record of such Japanese. Since the shogunate decided to ban to go to Ulleungdo in January 1696, no Japanese ships went there in 1696.\nAfter reading both of Korean and Japanese documents, it is clear that Ahn Yong-bok was a liar. He didn\u2019t meet powerful persons in Japan, he didn\u2019t make Japan (the shogunate) admit Ulleungdo and Usando (or Matsushima) to be Korean territory. He may have believed that Matsushima was Usando but he didn\u2019t have exact knowledge about Matsushima. His wrong impression that Matsushima was Usando remained later in the Korean documents and it made Korean people misunderstand the truth concerning the Liancourt rocks.\nThe following is a cutout from a 1864 Japanese map (\u5897\u8a02\u5927\u65e5\u672c\u8f3f\u5730\u5168\u56f3) that shows two very similar islands. Notice that the two islands on the map not only have similar shapes, but each also have a smaller neighboring island off their northeastern shores.\nI believe the above map is a good example of the confusion that existed in Japan in the 1800s in regard to the locations of the islands of Takeshima (\u7af9\u5cf6) and Matsushima (\u677e\u5cf6). The Japanese had traditionally used the name \"Takeshima\" to refer to the Korean island of Ulleungdo and the name \"Matsushima\" to refer to Liancourt Rocks, but by sometime in the 1800s, Matsushima was also being used to refer to Ulleungdo. In 1882, for example, a Japanese marker dated 1869 was found on Ulleungdo that proclaimed the island to be the Japanese island of Matsushima.\nThe Japanese mapmaker seemed to have known that Takeshima was farther from Japan than Matsushima, but the fact that the two islands were drawn with similar shapes suggests there was still name confusion.\nThe attendant observed that in the Yejo record, Ulleungdo\u2019s neighboring island of Songdo was part of the country of Usan.\n\"Songdo\" is the Korean pronunciation of \u677e\u5cf6, which the Japanese pronounce as \"Matsushima.\" It appears from this 1793 record that Koreans believed Songdo/Matsushima (\u677e\u5cf6) to be Ulleungdo, not Liancourt Rocks or not even a neighboring island of Ulleungdo.\nI am not sure how to translate the remaining portion of the passage, so if anyone has a translation, please let me know.<|endoftext|>"

Text and formal declarations are different.\nNakai Yozauburo voyaged from Ulleungdo to Dokdo before the island was incorporated we know this as fact. He did not \"occupy or live\" on Dokdo as his application stated. He was a poacher and a trespasser.\nAs I've stated twice, Nakai's business changed post incorporation to me this means his exclusive rights to the island gave him the resources to upgrade his equipment, thus making longer voyges feasible. Perhaps a larger boat as a result of teaming up with others who wanted a piece of the action or from securing capital from a bank. But before 1905 he illegally squatted on Ulleungdo and sailed from there.\nThe fact that Gwaneumdo and the other rock islets around Ulleungdo were insignificant was probably the very reason they were all lumped together with the catch-all phrase \"rock islets\" (\u77f3\u5cf6).\nThe only names Koreans ever used to refer to Liancourt Rocks was the Japanese name of \"Yangko\" and \"Dokdo,\" and those names did not start appearing until after the Japanese started carrying Koreans there on Japanese fishing boats in the early 1900s.\nSeokdo was never used to refer to Liancourt Rocks nor ever appeared on any Korean maps of Ulleungdo. It was only used as a general description of the rock islets around Ulleungdo.\nThe Korean Interior Ministry defined the boundaries of Uldo County in 1906, and Dokdo (Liancourt Rocks) was outside those boundaries. See \"July 1906, Korea Omits Dokdo from Uldo County.\"\nGerry, you are chasing your tail.\nThe article you refer to clearly states \"\u77f3\u5cf6\u201c was part of Uldo County. Nobody is denying that.\n Are you really so desperate?\n\"Amdo\" (\u5ca9\u5cf6 - \uc554\ub3c4) is not \"Seokdo\" (\u77f3\u5cf6 - \uc11d\ub3c4), and it was used as a descriptive term, not as the name of the island.\nIf you want to play that silly game, then look at the rock islets on this 1711 MAP of Ulleungdo. They were labeled as \"Seokbong\" (\u77f3\u5906 - \uc11d\ubd09), which means \"rock peaks.\" These rock islets are what \"Seokdo\" (\u77f3\u5cf6 - \uc11d\ub3c4) was referring to the the 1900 Korean edict.\nIf \"Seokdo\" had been Liancourt Rocks, then the Korean edict would have mentioned its location since Liancourt Rocks is not in the vicinity of Ulleungdo, but ninety-two kilometers away.\nDidn't you read the July 15, 1906 Korean newspaper article where Korea's Interior Ministry defined the boundries of Uldo County as stretching 24 kilometers (60 ri) from east-to-west and 16 kilometers (40 ri) from north-to-south? That very clearly eliminated the possibility that Seokdo was Liancourt Rocks.\nKorea's Interior Ministry had asked Sim Heung-taek to confirm the borders of Uldo County, and the above was Korea's Interior Ministry told Japan's Resident-General in Korea when he asked Korea to confirm Ulleungdo's neighboring islands.\nGerry, Gerry Gerry. What am I gonna do with you?\nI've told you a thousand times. The article regarding Uldo County gave the dimensions of Ullengdo Island NOT the dimensions of Uldo County. It was quoting the dimensions of Ulleungdo island from old Chosun maps.\nYou can see the identical dimensions on this old map of Ulleungdo.\nThe 1711 map refers to the rocks around Ulleungdo as \uc11d\ubd09 (\u77f3\u5cef) These are not islands Gerry just high rocks. I've been to Three Angels Rocks twice Gerry they are so close to Ulleungdo you can almost touch them from the shore. To think they issued a special edict to declare rocks less than 100 meters from shore is ridiculous.\nBTW you should start explaining these Chosun maps in more detail to your devoted followers.\nFor example you should tell them \u8457\u7530\u6d1e is todays Jeodong Harbour. You should tell them that \u523b\u77f3\u7acb\u7968 markes Dodong Harbour when Bak Seok Chang left his marker. In other words every map showing the phantom islands shows \"\u6240\u8b02\u4e8e\u5c71\u5cf6\u201c South of Dodong and thus this Usando Island is not Jukdo island Gerry, but rather a secondary island from the Ulleung Shillok recorded earlier. Bak assumed the island to the East was Usando but just years earlier it was unnamed just the same as Dokdo.\nCheck all of the maps you've posted on the right side Gerry. Then find \u8457\u7530\u6d1e and \u523b\u77f3\u7acb\u6f02.\nYou can see all of these verified locations moved counterclockwise (Northwest) and so did Bak Seok Chang's So-Called-Usando. Also Bak Seok Chang's \"Waiting Winds Place\" moved to the South as well. On top of that check was happened to Elephant Rock (\u5b54\u5ca9) from its original offshore location into on the mainland of Ulleungdo.\nYou've picked one attribute of these maps that supports your agenda and you've forcibly mislead readers to the wrong conclusion. What's it gonna look like when the truth about these maps comes out???\n1711 map have very accurate discription.\non South point\uff08\u5357/\u5348\uff09 it is difficult to confirm where it is,but there are landing point.\non west point (\u897f\uff09they assign big river considered \u53f0\u971e\u5ddd and \u6731\u571f\u7a9f.\nSo, turn Sattelite map by Google Earth, 7-8 degree clockwise to east side.\nIt is amazing match the each place on Google earth and map of 1711.\nConsidering the three prominent rivers, we can understand this map.\nthen,the other prominent river is southeast\uff08\u5dfd\uff09 of Ulleugndo.\nWow, the map is similar to the google earth photo!\nInteresting comparison, GTOMR.\nGMTOR. The characters found on Ulleungdo's northeast are \u4f47\u4f43\u6d1e.\nYou can see this on Bak Seok Chang's map here.\nToday this area is called Jeojeong Dong. It was also called Jeojeon Po. Please see this link.\nThis area was also called Naesujeon. There were actually 2 Jeojeon Po's, The So Jeon Po \u5c0f\u82e7\u6d66 was todays Naesujeon and Dae Jeon Po \u5927\u82e7\u6d66 was todays Jeodong. To the South of Jeodong was Do Bang Cheong \u90fd\u623f\u807d which is today's Dodong. You can see the same characters on this Japanese map of Ulleungdo.\nThis is Jukdo Islet due North of Jeodong take just a few meters South of Cheotdae Bawi.\nRemember, Dodong is even further South which would give the perception of Jukdo being even more northerly. It's not possible Bak Seok Chang perceived Jukdo Islet due East of Dodong Harbour because he drew other locations quite well not only by the compass but also relative (sequentially) to each other.\nOn Bak's 1711 Map to the South of Jeodong can be seen \u201c\u523b\u77f3\u7acb\u6a19\u201d. This marks the spot where Bak Seok Chang erected his stone marker in 1711.\nGTMOR, Jukdo Islet is about 4 kilometers almost directly North of Dodong Harbour not East. In fact Jukdo Islet is not visible from Dodong because Dodong is a very narrow harbour with high cliffs on either side. In addition, to the North of Dodong is a long point which restricts visibility unless you are quite far from Ulleungdo. At this point of visiblity Jukdo Islet is directly North.\nBak drew his survey map of Ulleungdo on site. The map was then amended with data from Jang Han Sang's 1693 Ulleungdo survey. Bak blindly copied the data from Jang Han Sang's entry into the Ulleungdo Shillok. This is why \"\u6240\u8b02\u4e8e\u5c71\u5cf6\u201c So-called Usando is drawn due East of Ulleungdo. This is also why it has the identical phrase \u6d77\u9577\u7af9\u7530 written on it.\nAbout 16 years before Bak drew his map the island to the East with haejang bamboo had no name. Later in the same century this island was called Jukdo Islet. Thus, when you see a map of Ulleungdo with Usando on it and five ghost islands to the South and you are not seeing Korea's Usando. You are seeing the assumptions of one inspector who made the supposition an island due East of Ulleungdo was Usando.\nOn another point. Knowing that Bak's map was influenced by the Ulleungdo Shillok there remains the possibility that the island form drawn to the South east was Jang Han Sang<|endoftext|>"

From the 1st to the 3rd of next month, the North Pacific high pressure will temporarily expand, but after that, it is expected to descend again to the south.\nTherefore, there is a good chance that it will rain again from the afternoon of the 3rd of next month.\nThe Korea Meteorological Administration explained that the forecast of the barometer in the future is highly volatile as tropical disturbances in the South China Sea and the Philippine Sea may shake the barometer.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " continue to present it in the future. This is a report on the content of this lecture.\nAt the beginning of the lecture, Master Ryuho Okawa said that they recorded a surge of spiritual messages throughout August. Referring to the purpose of publishing them as books in quick succession throughout September, Master Okawa said the August topics related to the Takeshima and Senkaku Islands issue.\nThe issue over these territories was immediately followed phrases that Master Okawa placed a heavy emphasis on such as the \u201coccupation of Japan\u201d and the \u201crecapture of Japan\u201d which were important themes in the movie \u201cFinal Judgement\u201d in June. He underscored anew that the issue, which the movie predicted, has already materialized and flared up in this period just before the second movie \u201cThe Law of Mystery\u201d that will be released in October..\nInitially remarking that he would deliver the lecture in an easy-to-understand way because the people of Kyushu would not understand if it was too abstract, the anger of the world\u2019s teacher toward modern Japan\u2019s cowardice erupted like magma.\n2. Why doesn\u2019t the mass media mention that Ito Hirobumi was assassinated before the merger with South Korea?\nFirst, the South Korea president Lee Myung-bak landed on Takeshima on August 10th, personally signed a document that said it was Korean territory, had lunch, and then returned. The Japanese government repeatedly described this performance as \u201cregrettable\u201d, took up the issue of the prime minister\u2019s personal letter, and reported that they would return it.\nFurther, in terms of topography, there is a deep 3000-meter ocean trench between Takeshima and the South Korean territory Ulleungdo, which separates Japan and South Korea. In documents from the Edo period, Ulleungdo was mistakenly written as \u201cTakeshima\u201d, giving rise to the confusion, but it was already a Japanese territory in the Edo period. Master Okawa pointed out that successive South Korean politicians have not been honestly teaching their citizens things such as the fact that even when Japan lost in the Second World War, Takeshima was not included in the list of abandonment territories, and Takeshima was understood to be Japanese property.\nFurther, Master also touched upon the issue of the four disputed islands. Mamiya Rinzo went to survey Sakhalin in the Edo period, and he called the strait between it and the mainland \u201cMamiya Strait\u201d. \u201cRussians didn\u2019t even live there. It was a Japanese man who mapped it, and Sakhalin was part of Japan,\u201d he asserted. Master Okawa pointed out that even before South Sakhalin was ceded to Japan in the Russo-Japanese War, it was Japanese territory.\nMaster Okawa continued with harsh comments for the Democratic Party of Japan\u2019s plans to stay in power regardless of how they appear to the public and their mistaken policies.\nReversing the direction of his stroke, Master Okawa fiercely questioned the stance of the mass media.\nMaster Okawa appealed to citizens to make the right choice in the election for the House of Representatives to be held this fall, saying, \u201cBecause politicians and the mass media think they\u2019re smart, and think that the world will just move as they say, then the people have to get angry about this, if the people still believe that this is a democracy.\n7. If Japan denuclearizes, then the price of power will increase. A tempest of bankruptcies will occur which will be also caused by tax hike.\n\u201cPerhaps becoming denuclearized or not will be the next major theme,\u201d Master Okawa said, referring to the next national election.\n\u201cIf electrical power is lost, it will affect manufactured goods. In essesnce, the price of goods will naturally rise. Then if consumption tax is imposed on top of this, things won\u2019t sell. Thus, to reduce expenses internally, we will start to see layoffs and the exploitation of subcontractors. There will be a lot of bankruptcies. I\u2019m saying this now, but when they eventually understand this, the politicians won\u2019t take responsibility.\u201d Master Okawa continued his comments, again inquiring into the air of irresponsibility surrounding the Noda administration, which forced passage of the bills that hiked the consumption tax.\n8. Why do China and South Korea bad-mouth Japan when it developed them in the \u201clost 20 years\u201d?\nAfterwards, Master Okawa launched into an inspection of Japan\u2019s \u201clost 20 years\u201d from a broad perspective.\nMaster Okawa then mentioned other topics. On the issue of comfort women, Master Okawa stated that prostitutes for the military did not exist. When both Japan and the Republic of Korea entered into the Treaty on Basic Relations, it was not even a problem at all. If this claim is permitted, then Japan should also make a compensatory claim to America for the Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuclear bombings. Yet, this act would undermine international relations.\nIn addition, seeing that America isn\u2019t intervening, despite Syrian government forces repeatedly massacring it citizens, even if nations such as China, North Korea, and South Korea cause trouble with Japan, a high possibility exists that America will adopt the same attitude that it did with Syria.\nMaster Okawa then concluded, saying, \u201cJapan\u2019s Self-Defense Forces are stronger compared with the Chinese and South Korean armies, so long as they fight with conventional weapons. However, if the Minister of Defense and Prime Minister make wrong judgment calls, or are weak-kneed, they will gradually erode their power without being able to fight something that they can fight. If they are the type of politicians that stay silent in the event Ishigaki Islands or an Okinawa islands were taken, then they could bring about a disastrous situation. There must be people in power in the government who can reliably command and maneuver the country through this difficult situation.<|endoftext|>"

They recorded the information as though they were undertaking a general survey [of the islands] and then left.\nI thus report this matter for your consideration as it was brought to my attention.\nThe submitted report has been read and given due consideration. The claim that Dokdo has become [Japanese] territory is completely groundless, so inquire again into the situation in the islands and the activities of the Japanese and submit an updated report.\n\u2022 This shows that the county magistrate of Uldo-gun (Ulleungdo) continued to govern Dokdo in 1906 pursuant to Imperial Decree No. 41 issued in 1900.\nQWhat are the terms of the Cairo Declaration of 1943, which laid out the basic position of the Allied Powers on Japan\u2019s territorial boundaries after World War II?\nJapan will also be expelled from all other territories which she has taken by violence and greed.\nQWhat was the position of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers as regards Dokdo when World War II came to an end in 1945?\n\u2022 After the end of World War II, the General Headquarters of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers excluded Dokdo from those territories controlled and administered by Japan as mandated in its instruction in SCAPIN (Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers Index Number) 677 on January 29, 1946.\n3. For the purpose of this directive, Japan is defined to include\u2026excluding (a) Utsuryo (Ullung) island, Liancourt Rocks and Quelpart (Saishu or Cheju) island...\n\u2022 Moreover, SCAPIN 1033 prohibited Japanese vessels or personnel from coming within 12 nautical miles of Dokdo.\nTakeshima(37\u00b015\u2032 North Latitude, 131\u00b053\u2032 East Longitude) nor have any contact with said island.\nQWhat are the provisions of the 1951 Treaty of Peace with Japan regarding Dokdo?\n\u2022 Of Korea\u2019s some 3000 islands, the said article refers to only Jejudo (Quelpart), Geomundo (Port Hamilton), and Ulleungdo (Dagelet) as examples. Therefore, the mere fact that Dokdo is not directly mentioned in the said article does not suggest that Dokdo is not included among those territories of Korea separated from Japan.\n\u2022 In consideration of the Allied Powers\u2019 stance reflected in the Cairo Declaration of 1943 and SCAPIN 677 of 1946, it should be understood that Dokdo is included among the territories of Korea separated from Japan.\nQWhat was the Korean government's response to its Japanese counterpart's proposal in 1954 to refer the issue of Dokdo to the International Court of Justice (ICJ)?\n- The proposal of the government is nothing but another false attempt disguised in the form of judicial procedures. Korea has the territorial rights ab initio over Dokdo and sees no reason why she should seek the verification of such rights before any international court...\n- As the Japanese Government is no doubt well aware, the aggression took place gradually, culminating in the annexation of all of Korea into Japan in 1910. For all practical purposes, however, Japan had seized the power to control Korea in 1904 when Japan forced Korea to sign the so-called Korea-Japan Protocol and the First Agreement between Korea and Japan.\n- Dokdo was the first Korean territory which was made a victim of the Japanese aggression. Now, in view of the unreasonable and persistent claim of the Japanese Government over Dokdo, the people of Korea are seriously concerned that Japan might be repeating the same course of aggression. To Koreans, Dokdo is not merely a tiny island in the East Sea. It is the symbol of Korean sovereignty.\n\u2022 The government of the Republic of Korea still maintains the same position.\nQHow is the Republic of Korea exercising its sovereignty over Dokdo?\n\u2022 The Republic of Korea holds legislative, administrative and judicial jurisdiction over Dokdo.\nFirst, a Korean police force is stationed on Dokdo, patrolling the island.\nSecond, the Korean military defends the waters and skies of Dokdo.\nThird, various laws and regulations including those specific to Dokdo have been enacted and implemented.\nFourth, a lighthouse and other government facilities have been constructed and are in operation on Dokdo.\nFifth, Korean civilians are residing on Dokdo.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": " the Grand Council of State, Japan\u2019s highest decision-making body during the Meiji period (1868-1912).\n\u201cIt was confirmed through negotiations between the old government [Edo Shogunate] and the Joseon government that the two islands [Dokdo and Ulleung Island] do not belong to our country [Japan],\u201d according to translations provided by Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry.\nJoseon (1392-1910) was the predecessor to modern-day Korea.\nA 1946 Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers instruction note was later laid down, specifically documenting that full sovereignty of the \u201cUtsuryo [Ulleungdo], Liancourt Rocks [Dokdo] and Quelpart [Jeju Island]\u201d were excluded from the governmental and administrative jurisdiction of Japan.\nThe San Francisco Peace Treaty, however, signed in 1951, mostly by Japan and the Allied powers, failed to settle ownership over Dokdo, falling short of mentioning other islands previously discussed.\nThe reasons for the omission remains unclear even now, though scholars here point out that Dokdo had been given to Korea in the first several drafts, only to be revised later when Japanese authorities lobbied to have that part stricken from the record.\nThe dispute has continued to exacerbate diplomatic relations between Seoul and Tokyo since, setting off firestorms when either government makes any sort of reference to the islets.\nTo solidify Seoul\u2019s stance on Dokdo, the Northeast Asian History Foundation last month once again organized a field trip to the islets, allowing the fourth group in the Northeast Asian History Academy for Foreigners to catch a glimpse of the volcanic rocks, formed millions of years ago.\nThey were just part of the group of some hundreds of Koreans, mostly middle-aged tourists in colorful alpine clothing, hoping that the weather would allow them to set foot on the nearly uninhabitable islets.\nWithout a seawall, more than half of the tourists who sail to the cluster of islets fail to land and are forced to be satisfied simply circling the area around it. Even in impeccable weather, visitors who receive permission to set foot on Dokdo are only allowed 20 minutes near the dock and must undergo heavy inspection by armed police officers, who guard against Japanese provocation.\nThe group, however, was out of luck on April 19, when just as the cruise ship was sailing a few hundred meters away from Dokdo, the captain made an announcement that the tide was too high for the vessel to dock - a declaration that prompted loud grunts and heavy sighs from those in the crowd.\nStill, the passengers, many carrying national flags in their hands, swarmed out to the deck and eagerly snapped shots of the islets, scrambling for a better spot to photograph the landscape.\nFor a while, nothing but the waves splashing against the ship and the cries of hungry seagulls could be heard.\nThe 33 foreigners from the academy looked at the two main islets from afar, finally able to observe in person what they had learned just a week ago in Seoul.\nExplaining that it was his second trip to Dokdo, Ravi Kumarranjan, an Indian national studying Korean language and literature at Kyung Hee University in Dongdaemun District, central Seoul, recalled he had been \u201cdumbfounded\u201d the first time he visited Dokdo.\n\u201cI heard about the territorial dispute between Korea and Japan ahead of my initial trip, so I was really looking forward to it,\u201d the 29-year-old said. \u201cBut then, I successfully landed on the island only to find nothing but rocks and police officers. I couldn\u2019t even see trees.\nKumarranjan remembered previously seeing Korean police officers on the island.\n\u201cForeigners [from a third country] really can\u2019t argue whether Dokdo belongs to Korea or Japan, but then you see people representing Korean authority on it and reach a conclusion that it\u2019s obviously their territory,\u201d he said.\nBattumur Batbayar, 27, a Mongolian studying international trade at Sogang University\u2019s Graduate School of International Studies, added that it was overwhelming to be surrounded by Koreans with so much national pride.\nAmong the five Chinese participants from the academy who joined in on the trip, Pan Yanmei from the Academy of Korean Studies in Seongnam, Gyeonggi, said she \u201cenvies\u201d Korea for being able to explain its stance on Dokdo to such a wide range of people.\nThe 42-year-old continued that she wished China would also implement such a tactic in its battle with Japan over an island controlled by Tokyo in the East China Sea, known as Senkaku in Japanese and Daioyu by Beijing.\n\u201cNobody but its own people believes Dokdo belongs to Japan,\u201d Pan said, laughing.\n\u201cPeople from, say Europe or the Middle East, don\u2019t know about the dispute or the island\u2019s historical background,\u201d she said, adding that most international visitors escorted to the rocks by domestic authorities were tempted to side with Korea.\nAccording to Chung, over the course of the program, a few Japanese students \u201csilently left the classroom\u201d in defiance of the lecturer\u2019s argument that Dokdo is Korean territory. Two Japanese participants did so last month when she took the rostrum.\nAll six Japanese nationals on the excursion to Dokdo declined to be interviewed for this article, except one who was of Korean descent.\nUpon learning that reporters from the Korea JoongAng Daily and a local broadcaster would accompany the group, some Japanese tourists who initially signed up for the journey withdrew, possibly fearing they would show up in Japanese media and face criticism upon returning home.\nRequesting that his full name not be used, the 19-year-old, who is currently learning Korean at a local university, said the history here was \u201cdifferent\u201d from what he learned back in his own country.\n\u201cPeople in Japan aren\u2019t really interested in the territorial dispute surrounding Dokdo,\u201d he said. And school textbooks there, he added, don\u2019t specify the reasons for the Japanese government\u2019s claim.\n\u201cThen, joining this program, I\u2019m taught all about the island,\u201d he said, implying that he had been left with no other choice but to conclude the islets were Korean territory, particularly with it being the only version of history he\u2019d ever heard.\nTo boost its learning program for foreigners to the next level, the Northeast Asian History Foundation seeks to target foreign diplomats in Seoul next, and Chung added that the special program has already been fully planned out in terms of its curriculum.\n\u201cWe get calls from embassies asking about educational programs,\u201d she said, \u201cbut there haven\u2019t been enough to actually put it on roll, so now we\u2019re basically focusing on promotion.<|endoftext|>"

Also, Liancourt Rocks is about ninety-two kilometers southeast of Ulleungdo and are essentially two islands, but all of Korea's old maps show it as one island just off shore of Ulleungdo.\nJukdo is a 51-acre (207,818 sq. meter) island that is approximately 2.2 km off the east shore of the Korean island of Ulleungdo (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6 - \uc6b8\ub989\ub3c4). It appeared on old Korean maps most often labeled as \"Usando\" (\u4e8e\u5c71\u5cf6 - \uc6b0\uc0b0\ub3c4).\nThis Korean map of Ulleungdo (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6 - \uc6b8\ub989\ub3c4) showed it with a small island off its eastern shore labeled as \"Usan\" (\u4e8e\u5c71). Hash marks at the bottom of the map showed that Usan was less than 4 km off Ulleungdo's east shore. That would mean that it would be Ulleungdo's neighboring island of Jukdo, which is about 2.2 km off Ulleungdo's east shore. Koreans claim that Usando was the old name for Dokdo (Liancourt Rocks), but Dokdo is 92 km southeast of Ulleungdo and is essentially two islands, not one. The map is stored in the National Library of Korea.\nThis Korean map of Ulleungdo (\u9b31\u9675\u5cf6 - \uc6b8\ub989\ub3c4) showed Usan (\u4e8e\u5c71 - \uc6b0\uc0b0) as a neighboring island just off Ulleungdo's east shore. The hash marks at the bottom of the map showed the island to be about 4 km offshore. Usando was the old Korean name for Ulleungdo's neighboring island of Jukdo, which is about 2.2 km of Ulleungdo's east shore.

Back when Trump talked to Kim Jong Un for the first time, South Korea cancelled its joint military drill with the U.S. along the border, yet it still did its regular drill on the rocks \"in case of an invasion from Japan\".\nSouth Korea is so obsessed with them that people all over the country cheered when some athlete swam all the way there. I once saw a video of some foreign exchange students being tricked into saying \u201cDokdo is Korean\u201d in broken Korean. The amount of brainwashing is abnormal.\nIt is Korean. Even US presidents recognise it as Korean. Even 17th century maps from Spain showed it as part of Korea. The only brainwashed people are the Japanese. Get over it.\nSouth Korea has no legal merit in the court of law.\nSouth Korea seized Takeshima after WW2 was over in the 1950s.\nJapan was defeated by USA with no navy or army left, signed pacifist constitution to renounce war.\nHands tied behind its back to defend or protect Japanese Islands, land, water. That's when brave South Korea decided to take Takeshima..... When we literally had no options to defend or do anything in return to protect our interest.\nWhen your weak, countries will take advantage of that. Takeshima is the perfect example!\nSouth Korea refuses to take this issue to the international community because they know what they did it's illegal and against the law.\n*When YOU'RE weak, countries will take advantage of that. *DOKDO is the perfect example!\nFURTHER, HISTORICAL EUROPEAN AND JAPANESE MAPS SHOWED DOKDO TO BE PART OF KOREA.\nThe United States has never consididered the Liancourt Rocks to be South Korean territory. In fact it was the US that told Japan that they should take SKorea to Court. Japan has trued 3 times but SKorea has always refused.\n[T]he United States concluded that they remained under Japanese sovereignty and the Island was not included among the Islands that Japan released from its ownership under the Peace Treaty... Though the United States considers that the islands are Japanese territory, we have declined to interfere in the dispute.\nRhee regime also seized by force and is holding illegally Takeshima Island which has always been considered as Japanese territory. This is very serious and permanent irritant in Japan-ROK relations and there can be no over-all ROK-Japan settlement until this Japanese island is returned to Japan. Therefore we should also press new ROK regime to return Takeshima to Japan.\nWhile we should press strongly for return of Takeshima to Japan, if by any chance new regime were unwilling to do so we should, as very minimum, insist that they agree to submit matter to International Court of Justice for arbitration.\"\nLet's not forget that South Korean authorities captured 327 Japanese fishing vessels. Out of the 3,911 fishermen detained, 8 died.\nEven 17th century maps from Spain showed it as part of Korea.\nAre you talking about Moon in Spain, had been laughed at for making same old misunderstanding a while ago?\nExplained easily and in general, Japan is an or let\u2019s say THE island country, so of course all near islands are Japanese, while all continental areas are not and belong to several countries. So, as a rule of thumb, Japan was and will be fought back anytime if it tries to gain any small continental ground, while the big rest in return just has to refrain and be fought back if they consider annexation of any Japanese islands. Those are in general the historically grown roles in the region and you can surely recognize that all reasons for former or future conflicts can be reduced to that easy theory or principle.\nWash, rince, repeat.\nPetty, real petty (not mentioning silly if not ridiculous from a diplomatic POV)...\nAs many here, I have my issues with the J-gov, but would really appreciate Korea to grow up as well, as obviously there are some heavy issues there too. Not holding my breath though...\nInstead of relying on a few pro Japanese Americans for evidence, why not mention SCAPIN 677 that preceded those events occurred straight after Japan's surrender?\nAnd despite your weak 'evidences', historical evidence rules.\nFact is there are plenty of historical maps in Europe recognising Dokdo as Korean. Even old Japanese maps indicated Dokdo as part of Korea.\nLook, in the event of a war between Korea and Japan over Dokdo, will the US support Japan? Nope.\nThen, it's Korea's. Get over it.\nGreat idea. Let's also not forget the millions of civilians that died by the IJA at the same time. But I guess, one Japanese person is worth more than a million foreigners and hence not worth remembering.\n(a) In June 1946, SCAP issued SCAPIN No. 1033 to expand the areas where Japanese were permitted to engage in fishing and whaling (the \u201cMacArthur Line\u201d).\nThe abolishment of the \u201cMacArthur Line\u201d was directed in April 25, 1952, and three days after, on April 28, the San Francisco Peace Treaty came into effect, which consequently nullified the directive to cease Japan's political and administrative power in the aforementioned areas.\nThe ROK claims that the Allies did not recognize Takeshima as part of Japan's territory based on the SCAPIN documents mentioned above, and includes them in the evidence for its claim of sovereignty over Takeshima. However, both of the SCAPIN documents clearly state that they shall not be construed as an indication of Allied policy relating to the ultimate determination of the assignment of Japanese sovereignty, and therefore such claims are obviously incorrect.\nThe territory of Japan was determined by the San Francisco Peace Treaty when it subsequently came into effect. This clearly shows that none of the treatment of Takeshima prior to the effect of that Treaty affects the title to Takeshima.\nGreat source. One would assume it's very objective since it's the mouthpiece of the LDP.\nPassing the buck to MOFA I see. Understandable when they don't teach you the full ropes.\nIt seems strange that Japan should claim islands belonging to all of its neighbors.\nYou think the governments of Spain, Italy, and Hungary all tried to show historical maps of Dokdo to Korea to give Japan a laugh? You do realise they are laughing at you?\nI mean... I wonder if you really think the governments of Spain, Italy, and Hungary all tried to show historical maps for support shooting to prove Takeshima had belonged to the peninsula?\nDokdo is Korean. End of story.\nLong time ago, Japanese fishermen certainly recognized the existence of Jukdo \u7af9\u5cf6 near Ulleungdo island. At that time, Takeshima did not designate the Liancourt Rocks, but Jukdo to Japanese fishermen. Both Jukdo and Ulleungdo are now Korean territories that Japan and the other countries acknowledge. Now the Japanese government claims the territorial right with a wrong name or a wrong location.\nBut only one exception is the remotely-located Liancourt Rocks, called 'Dokdo' in Korean, which literally means a rock island. It is a consistency problem. Koreans knew that it consisted of rocks, and therefore bamboo could not grow there. The so-called bamboo island without any bamboo was just an ad hoc, imaginary island for Japan to forcefully occupy Dokdo in 1905. Now they still shout \"the bamboo island without any bamboo is a Japanese territory\".\nBut only one exception is the remotely-located Liancourt Rocks, called 'Dokdo' in Korean, which literally means a rock island.\nThanks for that additional information. This is what happens when you try and force a square peg through a circle. As an American, I will always support Korea on this issue. I've had my fair share of time in Japan to know the tactics used by Japan to get what they want. And through my own research, I am confident Dokdo is Korean.<|endoftext|>"

The failures that can occur at the sensors and sensor nodes may be classified into hard failures including electric power depletion and hardware part failure, and soft failures including calibration errors and random noise errors of various sensors installed at sensor nodes. There are cases in which a failure detection algorithm, the type that combines the consensus algorithm and localized faulty sensor detection (LFSD) algorithm, which can detect both the hard failure and soft failure simultaneously [9].\nThere are also studies on techniques for recovering sensors in the failed gateway, rather than shutting down the system or re-clustering the whole system, when a failure occurs in the multi-tier structure of a wireless sensor network. This recovery technique is to re-associate the sensors managed by the failed gateway to other clusters based on the backup information created during clustering by checking the status of the gateway periodically [10, 11]. There are also case studies permitting through proposing a heterogeneous backup schema that replaces a type of sensor with another type of sensor, based on the fact that a sensor node has a high rate of sensing failure for a sensor network permitting low overhead failure [12].\nSensor nodes with limited communication bandwidth and electric power must perform cooperation, which is an effective way to maintain communication and electric power and is resistant to failure. From the perspectives of communication cost, precision, accuracy, and number of recoverable failure sensors in the sensor network, value fusion and decision fusion have each been suggested as an effective cooperation-type target detection algorithm. The value fusion algorithm has better performance when no sensor node failure occurs, while the decision fusion based algorithm is preferred for lower communication overhead when a failure occurs. To improve detection performance, a study on the optimum arrangement of sensors in an area of interest is also necessary [13].\nHowever, the above mentioned studies lack consideration for the harsh marine environment where failure frequently occurs due to the environmental changes and its difficulty for recovering the failure. Also, the problems of data failure, which is the main focus of this study, are not stated in that report.\nA marine USN is a system that recognizes marine resources or their environment by installing sensor nodes fixed either on the ocean floor or underwater, builds and manages real-time information through network, and allows a user to control and manage it on the ground [16, 17].\nA marine USN is a kind of wireless sensor network that combines undersea wireless communication technology and sensing technology, and links undersea wireless communication technology to ground communication. It is difficult to directly apply land-based sensor network technology to marine USNs due to the characteristics of their environment. In a marine USN, compared with the general land-based USNs, sensors and sensor nodes are more expensive and more difficult to deploy, so it is necessary to design a network with sufficient ruggedness and reliability.\nMarine sensors currently in commercial use are especially big, heavy, and mostly expensive, and their power consumption is generally not small. Marine sensor units rapidly corrode, with undersea life and salinity often shortening their lifespan [16]. Since a marine USN has to efficiently manage an expensive marine sensor system placed in a harsh environment such as under the sea, it is necessary to develop a technology to discover and recover from failure rapidly.\nA marine USN, for the purpose of efficient data transmission under limited environmental conditions, should have strengthened performance including that of local data storage, and it also becomes necessary to develop a node management function that properly adjusts the sensing and transmission interval [16].\nIn order to develop business models, USN application services have been performed since 2005 under an initiative of the government of Korea by applying USN technology to various objects and environments. Table 2 shows Korean field tests and pilot projects in which USN technology is applied to marine areas [4 - 8].\nIn the USN-based Jeju costal marine environment information system, buoys mounted with Zigbee sensor nodes are installed and marine environment information is collected through USN. This USN based weather and ocean observation system has been applied as a pilot program of wireless mesh network technology in islands and ocean areas where it is difficult to expand existing network infrastructure. In the U-Ulleungdo and Dokdo disaster early forecasting system, data measured by sensors can be transmitted to, stored in, and managed by servers in real-time through a high speed internet network and CDMA. In the ALL-IP-based USN observation system, an IP-USN and wireless mesh network were introduced as a pilot program to build a USN-based observation network. Also, data is transferred to the server through sensors, gateways, a wireless mesh network, and an internet link. In the Suncheon Bay USN marine cluster and convergence service, an 800 MHz-bandwidth CDMA wireless network and wire/wireless private network were built so that various observation devices installed in Suncheon Bay can collect data and provide information in real time.\nThe feasibility of the pilot projects in Table 2 was verified by applying them to public sectors such as weather/marine sectors with high utilization of and demand for a USN and the projects contributed to the popularization and promotion of the USN. These service models were proposed a way that involved installing a sensor node and gateway as a link between the sensor network and network infrastructure. Also, it was proven that a wireless mesh network could be used as the infrastructure for a USN installation area in which it was difficult to build wire networks [5].\nFor modeling of failure-tolerant functions and failure-recovery techniques of marine USNs, we investigated and analyzed a U-aqua farm environmental management system, which is a marine water quality environmental monitoring system for Gaduri Aqua Farms at Songdo Island of Yeosu [7]. Fig. 2 shows a diagram of the U-aqua farm environment management system.\nThree sets of sensors and sensor logger systems have been built in the neighboring area and inner area of the Gaduri Aqua Farms. A sensor logger system collects information sensed by the sensors and stores it in a self local storage to prevent any data loss. The data in the sensor logger is transmitted to the integrated operation server through the wireless mesh network, and now, the services providing water quality environment information become available over the website. The wireless communication-type sensor logger system consists of water quality sensors measuring the water quality environment, sensor nodes managing the data received from the sensors and performing a defined data protocol transformation, and a gateway linking sensor node to the communications network.\nConfiguration of U-aqua farm environmental management system.\nFig. 3 shows the interior and exterior of the sensor logger system. As a marine water quality sensor is expensive, and it is costly to install multiple sensors, we provided storage space for the sensor to store sensed data for a certain period of time.\nInterior and exterior of sensor logger system.\nIn the test system for failure modeling, data is transmitted from the sensor via a sensor logger containing a sensor node and gateway, to the access point (AP) and database server. As marine water quality environmental data should be transmitted with accuracy, the transmission should recover quickly from errors when failure occurs. In this study, the types of failure are classified into system element failure, communication failure, and data failure.\nSystem element failure is caused by hardware or software failure. System failure is classified, based on the types of devices, into that of a sensor, that of a sensor logger containing a sensor node and gateway, and that of a database server, as shown in Table 3. The remark column in the table notes the types of failure on the existing distributed system that were studied. Sensor failure occurs where a sensor physically fails due to conditions such as salinity or is lost by a sea current, typhoon, etc., and can be measured by whether there is a response to the gateway's periodic request for data. Sensor logger failure is a failure of the system to transmit certain data to the server and can be discovered by using a timeout from the server to the gateway. Lastly, failure of the database server can be discovered by failure to service the stored data for a long period of time.\nCommunication failure occurs in the process of data transmission using a wire/wireless communication network. The categories of communication failures that we noted include the following: the failure in updated recent data is not transmitted due to a cable failure in the wire communication between the water quality measurement sensor and sensor node, the failure in which the data maintained at the gateway is not transmitted to the server in the communication between the gateway and AP, and the failure that occurs due to a propagation collision caused by interference. This article focuses on the communication failures shown in Table 4.\nIn case of wire communication (RS-232C) between a sensor and sensor node, a failure can occur in which data is not transmitted to the gateway, even though the sensor measures the data correctly. The gateway is not easily accessible as they are installed in a harsh environment; therefore, a timeout method is established, and a failure is identified when no response is made at the periodic data request to the sensor from the gateway.\nFor the wireless communication (Wi-Fi) between the gateway and database server, first, failure occurs when the data maintained at the gateway is not transmitted to the server, and is identified when no data transmission is made from the database server to the corresponding gateway. By installing a timeout, a failure is identified when no response is made at the periodic data request to the sensor<|endoftext|>"

The oceanfront gem is the Healing Stay Kosmos resort, a stunning manifestation by Seoul-based architectural firm The System Lab\u2019s principal, Chanjoong Kim, of the powerful natural beauty that surrounds the island.\nThe synergy of yin and yang \u2013 considered by locals to be a sacred core of the island, much like the sky, the earth and the waters \u2013 informs the award-winning property, which impresses from miles away. A duo of stark white concrete units, the four-room Villa Kosmos and the eight-room Villa Terre, make up the architectural backbone of the property, which also features six swirl-shaped branches and two rings situated in the outdoor lawns, each looking out to the majestic Elephant Rock or Songgotbong (also known as Ice Pick Peak). Standing against crashing waves and mountainous terrains, the form elegantly swoops and bends, lending to a chi-like inclination and echoing the ebb and flow of the surrounding elements.\nCelestial influences extend to every corner of the property\u2019s interiors, buoying guests\u2019 quests into zen-filled escapes. High, snow-white curved ceilings that give the impression of an ultra-exclusive igloo lead into the sprawling Villa Kosmos, available to be rented as a whole, where each room (and its stunning sea views) is designed to capture an element of the universe: fire, earth, wood or gold.\nVilla Terre, meanwhile, takes inspiration from the earth. Each element inspires the materials of the furnishings and amenities of each room, from an oak-tree dining table and a bar made from volcanic rock to bespoke stools created by artists and designers including Lee Hun-chung, Emilio Nanni, Cini Boeri and Grete Jalk.\nConceptualised as a \u201ccontainer of energy\u201d, the resort\u2019s exteriors are also imbued with carefully considered lighting \u2013 gentle and sparse \u2013 tracing the landscape yet creating a seamless unity with the island\u2019s natural hues, almost blending into it over time. A bevy of five-star refinements give way to a true luxury resort experience, yet each is inseparable from the surrounding wilderness. Two saunas symbolise the moon (yin) and the sun (yang); a stone\u2019s throw away, an outdoor terrace sits atop a 30-metre cliff edge, next to an infinity Jacuzzi that uses water melted from snow stacked in the Nari Basin, a resplendent volcanic depression in Ulleungdo.<|endoftext|>"

        "passage": "ok's Usando was not Matsushima.\nThe Shogunate's and Dottori's correspondence predates the second Anyongbok incident, this is said to have already affected the Shogunates decision before the spring of 1696.\nGerry, the map you post has nothing to do with Anyongbok's incident as recorded. First Anyongbok said Jasando (Matsusshima) was 50ri away from Ulleungdo. As you know this is much too far away to be Jukdo Islet.\nThe map you link to is typical of incorrect ancient maps of Ulleungdo. As you know there are five large islands on this map(the same size as \"Usando\") located to the South. These islands do not exist. Secondly the position of this Usando as related to other prominent rock formations on Ulleungdo's shore make it unlikely the islands were included as part of the initial on-site survey but rather added on later.\nThe map you cite is a departure from the Anyongbok incident which states Matsushima~Usando was a distant island and thus we can't say they are related at all. As for the true identity of Usando, Anyongbok was far more familiar with the region than the inspectors who only visited the island for a few days, every few years under the vacant islands policy.\nGerry says \"Rhee was told by the allies his line was illegal and the peace treaty allowed Japan to keep the islands....\"\nGerry, did Kaneganese and Pacifist slip something in your drink to utter such nonsense? Nowhere within the sacred text of the San Francisco Peace Treaty is there any mention of Liancourt Rocks. Various drafts of the treaty gave the islands to Korea, Japan or simply excluded the issue. The final draft dropped the islands totally.\nAdditionally we know the allied countries determined the possession of Japan's outlying islands more on military advantage rather that true territorial rights. This can be seen on the example of Marcus Islands and Cheju Islands.\nPro-Jo's stance on Takeshima is refuted here.\nAs I said, the purpose of the article was to point out the errors in the claims made in the video, and Professor Shimojo Masao did a good job of doing that.\nKorea's historical claims on Liancourt Rocks (Dokdo) are all smoke and mirrors, just like your arguments.\nIt does not matter what An Yong-bok said since he was a lying, goofball nobody. Japan did not concede Liancourt Rocks (Dokdo) to Korea, and there are no Japanese or Korean documents that say they did.\nAn Yong-bok said that Matsushima was 50 Japanese ri (200 km) away from Ulleungdo while the Korean mainland was only 30 Japanese ri (120 km). The distance from the Korean mainland to Ulleungdo was pretty much correct since the real distance is about 134 kilometers, but the distance to An Yong-bok's Matsushima (Jasando) was more than double the distance from Ulleungdo to Dokdo (Liancourt Rocks). An said Matsushima was 200 kilometers away from Ulleungdo, but the distance of Dokdo from Ulleungdo is only 92 kilometers.\nThe 1711 map most certainly does have something to do with the events in the 1690s since those events caused Korea to begin regular inspections of Ulleungdo, and the 1711 map shows that Usando was almost certainly Ulleungdo's neighboring island of Jukdo, not Dokdo (Liancourt Rocks).\nRegardless of whether those five islands shown just off Ulleungdo's southern shore on many Korean maps are islets or rocks, dozens of Korean maps show \"Usando\" as a neighboring of Ulleungdo, but no Korean map shows is as Dokdo (Liancourt Rocks). Also, those islands or rocks shown off Ulleungdo's southern shore were not named, but the island just off Ulleungdo's east coast was named. It was named Usando. Even Korean historians are now starting to admit that the Usando on many of Korea's maps was Ulleungdo's neighboring island of Jukdo.\nRegardless of what An Yong-bok may have thought, it was the opinion of Korean officials that mattered, and their opinion was that Usando was a neighboring island of Ulleungdo, not Dokdo.\nAs regards the island of Dokdo, otherwise known as Takeshima or Liancourt Rocks, this normally uninhabited rock formation was according to our information never treated as part of Korea and, since about 1905, has been under the jurisdiction of the Oki Islands Branch Office of Shimane Prefecture of Japan. The island does not appear ever before to have been claimed by Korea.\nGerry, you are so predictable it's almost sad. Why don't you just let me talk directly to the Takeshima lobbyists head director and eliminate you (the middleman) altogether?\nAnyongbok said Matushima was 50ri away from Ulleungdo, the Oyas and the Murakawas said is was 40ri and they voyaged there many times as well. They were both inaccurate. The point is there is no way in Hell one could mistake 50ri for only 2ri. Anyongbok's Jasando was not Jukdo, get over it.\nAt any rate, his correspondence was forwarded to the Japanese shogunate. He declared Matsushima as part of Korea and no matter what you feel Jasando may or may not have been, to the Japanese Matsushima meant Dokdo~Takeshima. Japan made no objection to Anyongbok's assertions. Some would say this amounts so acquiesence, I say it is 100% proof positive Japan did not consider Matsushima as Japanese territory in the 17th Century.\nThis view is buttressed by the 1695 Dottori correspondence with the Shogunate in early 1695.\nGerry, maybe some historians agree some maps show Usando in the position of Jukdo Islet. It shows they have enough integrity to agree with many theories (unlike you) However, these same historians are quick to point out Anyongbok's Jasando was Matsushima. The difference is Gerry, you are trying to make blanket statements on a plethora of Usando historical references that lead us in many different direction to suit your agenda. This is not history, but lobbying.\nAs far as YOUR interpretations of these maps, they are just that. The phrase I continually see in you posts is \"almost certainly\" Well, we aren't going to be remapping northeast Asia on your agenda-driven assumptions Gerry. The Usando issue is but one area of contention in the Dokdo Takeshima dispute and your Usando=Jukdo=Takeshima is Japanese land is a very simplistic approach.\nThe San Francisco Peace Treay isn't worth the parchment it is printed on for a variety of reasons Gerry. Let's dismantle this document on a point by point basis.\nFirst as I've said, the final draft of the San Francisco Peace Treaty made no mention of Liancourt Rocks, and anyone who says it did is full of it. Here is the entire text of the treaty Gerry and if you can point out the part about Liancourt Rocks please enlighten us all.\nNext the decisions the Americans made regarding the disposition of Japan's outlying islands were for military decisions. This can be seen on a number of documents.\nThe correspondence by Steeves shows although some Americans believed Liancourt Rocks was historically Korea, military agenda took precedent over this matter.\nThis document shows the British even considered giving Chejudo to the Japanese in the event communists overran the Korean peninsula.\nBut probably the most obvious example of America's military agenda in the San Francisco Peace Treaty are the documents concerning Marcus Island. Marcus Island much like Liancourt Rocks was clandestinely annexed in 1898 with very little notification. Although Japan had sovereignty over island, the Americans did not give sovereignty back after WWII.\nThe San Francisco Peace Treaty documents explain why. The Americans wanted a long-term naval base there. So as you see, the San Francisco Peace Treaty was not a treaty that gave territories based on historical title at all.\nAmerica never returned Marcus Island to Japan. They sold the island back in the 1970s I think.\nKorea is in no way legally bound by allied decisions as she wasn't signatory to the San Francisco Peace Treaty. In fact, none of Japan's neighbours, (China, Russia, North Korea) those who bore the brunt of Japan's aggressions had any say at all. This is shameful.\nI'm also sick of the Japanese lobbyists on this forum blubbering about the Rhee line as if it was some land grabbing draconian line dreamed up at the last minute. It was simply the establishment of the boundary proposed by other nations in earlier drafts of the San Fran Peace Treaty. The Rhee line is almost identical.\nBy the way there are video about Ulleungdo inspection by Japan's Takeshima scholor.\nThere are typial Korean who loves personal attack.\nI've been looking for the videos. I hope they will be translated in English.\nYou should know that Korean committed emptying ulleung-do and dok-do policy for centuries..\nAnd yes. there might have been times when korean map makers were confused about dok-do and juk-do..\nBut as I said, you should know it has been left un<|endoftext|>"
