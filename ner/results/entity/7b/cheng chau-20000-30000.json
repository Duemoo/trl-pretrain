It points out that most of the interpretations except the stochastic interpretation are not affected by this theorem. According to this theorem, any viable stochastic theory of quantum mechanics should be a stochastic hidden variable theory, as is shown by Montina\uff07s results. Notwithstanding this, the \u03c8epistemic approach is still possible if we follow Einstein\uff07s idea not to accept the ontological model of quantum mechanics.<|endoftext|>Whenever I visit Hong Kong, I like to take one of the ferries to an outlying island. Cheng Chau is just 30 minutes away and the small harbor still has photogenic Chinese ships. The few seafood restaurants only use ingredients that are live, from finfish to scallops, crabs to spiny lobsters. It is possible to find live seafood locally, although not of this abundant variety.\nThe best selection is at William Ho\u2019s (3524 N. Oakland Ave.). Many patrons whisk through the lobby to the buffet tables in search of live lobsters, tilapia and Dungeness crabs, all of which are very fresh and lively. When Ho\u2019s first stocked live seafood, the choices also included geo-duck clam, eel and abalone. Those options may be gone, but this is still a top pick for lobster. It\u2019s effortless to eat: No shell cracking is required, and chopsticks will suffice.\nWhenever I visit Hong Kong, I can never understand...\nWhenever I visit Hong Kong, I can never understand what they are saying.\nWhenever I visit Hong Kong, I like to take a ricks...\nWhenever I visit Hong Kong, I like to take a rickshaw to The Canny Man down in the Wan Chai district.

Thank you for unburnt cookies. Thank you for birds that take cat naps in the crepe myrtle.\"\nSome days it's hard to get beyond the aggravations. The demands of our jobs. The endless housework. Unnecessary rudeness. Apathy. Politics. Cruelty. It's easy to be overwhelmed and blind to the soft spoken sweetness of each and every day.\nI'm starting a new project. I've been playing with how to proceed for sometime and the more I ponder the more excited I become. Winter's melancholy has gone on long enough and I'm ready to take a photo walk through Shannon's gratitude journal. There is something about the soft morning light through the bedroom window that touches me, allows me to see simple things in a special way. So I started there...\nAs I play with the idea of a series of still life moments, full of wonderful \"things\" that make our hearts sing, I realize how many times someone, especially on Facebook, will mention one of their gratitude moments and I resonate with them. I smile because they smile.\nBefore I embark on this new adventure....April 5, Shannon's 37th birthday, I invite you to share with me what makes you smile.

        "passage": ", [the slices] stay on the whole fish until your order comes in.\" And a made-to-order model enables FreshDirect to control costs by minimizing inventory. \"We've cut a huge amount of time out of the supply chain because we don't have to stock as much as a normal store,\" says McGowan.\nSince it opened its doors in 2002, $200-million Sprouts Farmers Market based in Phoenix has specialized in the \"farmer's market niche,\" touting high-quality food at affordable prices. Sprouts' 19 locations use an open store design, with low aisles and farm-fresh and organic products located in bins at the center of stores. A strong emphasis on customer service has made the core technology challenge one of ensuring that \"what's on the shelf satisfies the demand,\" says Doug Sanders, senior VP and COO.\nSo Sprouts uses Retalix Ltd.'s Category Analyzer, an inventory management application that provides its ordering managers with information on which products are selling and which need to be ordered, as well as Retalix HQ, which feeds current product pricing and other information to cash registers and handhelds. Now managers can forecast what Sprouts anticipates selling so vendors \"can get us the items we need,\" says Sanders. By the end of next year, Sanders hopes to make inventory information available to suppliers through Sprouts' Web-based portal. That way, Sprouts ordering managers and suppliers can coordinate product ordering online. In the meantime, managers can access some inventory and pricing data through the portal.\nBetter information does more than create operational efficiency; it also helps improve customer service. At FreshDirect, business intelligence is central to that goal, says McGowan. For example, in 2006, when batches of California spinach were discovered to contain the E. coli virus, FreshDirect's systems could alert customers who had ordered the affected crop and reassure those who had ordered spinach from unaffected regions. And soon the company plans to provide customer-specific screen views to reflect customer tastes; a vegetarian customer, for example, shouldn't have to view the virtual meat aisle, but he should see recipes that call for the products he buys, says McGowan.\nAt Sprouts, centralized data and Web-based initiatives are also helping with thorny workforce issues. According to the industry research group Food Marketing Institute, in 2006 average turnover for the labor-intensive grocery industry was 42%, so companies are turning to technology to stay on top of hiring, payroll and benefits.\nOver the past eight months, Sprouts has begun deploying workforce management technologies from Unicru/Kronos Inc. to automate payroll entry and manage information for its 1,500 employees. And because this employee time and attendance data is centralized, it streamlines the process of transferring employees between Sprouts' 19 stores, says Sanders. Ultimately, employees will be able to choose benefits online and view paycheck information and vacation time.\nOnline capabilities also help with hiring. If an applicant applies online for a deli manager position at a store with no openings, the website makes his information available to other locations with open positions. All these online tools increase staff access to information, enabling Sprouts to hire and retain a \"better-quality employee,\" says Sanders.\nAt Scarborough, Maine-based Hannaford Bros. Co., deploying Lawson Software's Web-based payroll and benefits system has helped lower costs and minimize turnover for its 25,000-strong workforce. \"We had people on the books who were still receiving medical coverage weeks after they had been terminated,\" says Jon Doody, team leader of HR and payroll at Hannaford. Paycheck errors had to be fixed retroactively. Now managers at its 158 stores no longer have to fax changes to the payroll department; they can enter this data online, which allows Hannaford to save $125,000 annually by streamlining administrative tasks and reducing paper. Since payroll administrators devote less time to data entry, their position has become \"more strategic,\" says Doody. That has increased payroll employees' job satisfaction and, combined with Lawson's self-service options that allow all employees to enroll in benefits online, has helped reduce Hannaford's turnover from 59% to 47%.\nFor these retail groceries, upcoming IT projects aim to build on gained efficiency. FreshDirect is trying to find software that can provide its 400 delivery people with information on the most effective routes around the city. That's a tall order for any technology, notes McGowan, since it has to make sense of New York's myriad logistical challenges, including whether it makes more sense for delivery people to park two blocks from an apartment building and walk.\nAnd at Sprouts, Sanders hopes to move even more information online, providing vendors with immediate access to the company's inventory needs and employees with scheduling and payroll information.\nBut, says Sanders, with its plans to expand from 19 stores to 50 locations by 2010, Sprouts has chosen a path of incremental technology improvements so it can concentrate on growth. \"The focus right now is fundamentals: getting solid ordering and receiving and inventory controls in place. Then you can do all the other fun stuff.\"\nLauren Horwitz, former managing editor, production, for CIO Decisions, is now managing editor for TechTarget's Data Center Media Group.

It's a bit esoteric though, and you have to wonder how much the kids really got.\nA sizable hit last Christmas, this Hong Kong animated feature is obviously targeted at children. Aside from the cute character designs, My Life as McDull comes complete with merchandising and an extensive ancillary franchise. The animation is aided by obvious computer generated backgrounds, but it retains a charming hand-drawn look that's pleasing to the tykes. McDull is an animated pig. And he's cute.\nWith all that, it's a wonder that My Life as McDull turns out to have a rather existential theme and a narrative style that would do Hideaki Anno (of Neon Genesis Evangelion) proud. Massive voice-over from an adult McDull (voiced by Jan Lam) narrates this episodic tale of young McDull's experiences with hope and disappointment as he and his mother (voiced by Sandra Ng) struggle through their low-income lives.\nMcDull was born dimwitted despite his mother's prayers for a handsome, smart son. There's no Dad around, so Mom has to make do alone. Mom continually prays for McDull's luck and life to change. However, his desires are simple. He wants to go to the Maldives. He wants a turkey dinner for Christmas. He wants things that are beyond their means.\nThey really can't afford these things, but his mother tries to please him anyway. She gets him the turkey, but the leftovers drive him crazy. Instead of the Maldives, she takes McDull to The Peak and pretends it's the Maldives. In exchange, McDull can only give into his mother's wishes and attempt to make something of himself. He decides to train to become an Olympic level athlete like Hong Kong Olympian Li San-San. However, the trade he learns is Cheng Chau Bun Catching, which involves training heavily to snatch meat buns from large towers. Huh?\nIt's actually esoteric details like these that make the movie special. My Life as McDull is steeped in a realistic, actual representation of Hong Kong, from the Peak Tram to the Wellcome grocery stores. McDull and his mother may be animated pigs, but their lives are those of working class Hong Kong residents. They visit the market and the temple regularly. Getting to Central requires a trip on the bus, and getting to Cheng Chau means taking the ferry. Landmarks (like Times Square in Causeway Bay) and streets are made to be actual. The Bun Catching thing is based on an actual festival activity that once took place in Hong Kong. It's a charming, involving effect, especially for those who either live or have visited the region.\nFurthermore, McDull's life has large metaphorical implications that are quite obvious when you stop to take a look. Despite being dim-witted and below average, McDull struggles gamely to make something of himself. He wants to be true to his mother's love and remains positive in his goals. And even if he never seems to make it, there's something inspiring in his effort. That he's an animated pig practicing bun-snatching kung-fu makes everything seem silly, but the sentiments behind it are not.\nThe stumbling block here is the self-referential storytelling that could leave most kids in the dust. Do any children out there really enjoy watching barely animated still frames with existential voiceover laid on top? The film's sentiments can prove quite charming and affecting, but when it comes out in existential voiceover, you would think that the kids would never catch it. The sounds and images speak to them, but the film's voice ultimately might not.<|endoftext|>If you're looking for compassionate, high-quality dental care, you've found Twin City Dental.

He received his BA from Franciscan University in 1989. Originally planning a career in business, his interest in philosophy was awakened through the discovery of Dietrich von Hildebrand's thought in the areas of love, marriage and ethics. After graduating from Franciscan, he and his wife, Katie, studied together at the International Academy of Philosophy under Josef Seifert, John Crosby and Rocco Buttiglione, deepening their interest in personalist philosophy, especially as it is found in the work of such thinkers as von Hildebrand, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, John Henry Newman and Karol Wojtyla. He received his doctorate in 2000, and is preparing his dissertation on von Hildebrand's analysis of moral wrong-doing for publication. He has taught courses at Franciscan University, the International Theological Institute in Gaming, Austria, and at St. John's Seminary in s'Hertogenbosch, Netherlands. He is currently Assistant Professor and Chairman of Philosophy at Ave Maria University, where he has been teaching since 2000. His appreciation for and dedication to von Hildebrand's legacy continues to grow, in part through close friendship and intellectual collaboration with von Hildebrand's widow, Alice von Hildebrand, who spends summers in New Hampshire with the van Schaijiks and their five children.<|endoftext|>For nearly four weeks, Alfred Boonkong, Christopher John and I went on mission to the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui (HKSKH), the Province of the Anglican Communion in Hong Kong and Macau. This was my first trip outside of Europe and began with my first ever long-haul flight, which ran incredibly smoothly, with us all arriving from our various locations on Thursday 21st April. As I was the first to arrive I was instantly taken for my first Hong Kong food: a bread-meal with sock tea, which was lovely and refreshing after hitting the heat and humidity that knocked me as much as the jetlag, but also began my most lasting memory of HKSKH, a wonderful hospitality and generosity centred around food, tea and fellowship.\nOur time was mainly divided between two activities; travelling around the Province, meeting people and learning about life in Hong Kong and Macau; and teaching through retreats, quiet days and lectures about Franciscan Spirituality and the Religious Life. We discovered an incredibly welcoming and generous culture, full of spirituality and the love of God, with many wonderful blessings. The churches are packed with both young and old, men and women, speaking a cacophony of languages: English, Cantonese, Mandarin, Tagalog and several others.\nWe were mainly based at Ming Hua Theological College in the Central area of Victoria Island, where we lived alongside the postulants, those training for ordination, always aware of the constant nightlife opposite us in Lan Kwai Fong, the bar and clubbing district. Living alongside the postulants was a brilliant experience and helped me to experience more of the local life, being told where was good for shopping and to just sit and people watch with a cup of coffee.\nWe also spent time on Cheng Chau, an island about 30 minutes from Victoria Island and famed for its luscious mango snacks. This is where the Province keeps a small retreat house among beautiful and awe-inspiring scenery, with sea eagles flying overhead and following the fishing boats out to sea. Here we led two retreats on the life of Francis and made some delightful new friends. We also visited a wonderful"

She\u2019s been doing so since 2007, when her son was sentenced in federal court to 15 years, after pleading guilty to a series of drug-fueled bank robberies. While Mary lives on a fixed income that doesn\u2019t leave much money to play with, she says she is afraid of what will happen to her son if she were to stop sending the money. \u201cI just want to make sure he\u2019s safe,\u201d she says.\nThat\u2019s right: the Federal Bureau of Prisons routinely extracts funds from the family members of prisoners, who can face hardship consequences if they are unwilling, or unable, to make monetary payments demanded by prison staff under the BOP\u2019s Inmate Financial Responsibility Program (IFRP).\nThe Inmate Financial Responsibility Program is intended to \u201cencourage\u201d federal prisoners who own financial obligations, i.e., fines, restitution, etc., to \u201cvoluntarily\u201d pay down their debt while they are incarcerated. Governed by a Federal Bureau of Prisons Policy Statement (Program Statement 5380.08) and federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 545.10 {et seq.}, the IFRP allows local staff to set a payment schedule to \u201chelp the inmate develop a financial plan\u201d that is \u201ccommensurate with [the prisoner\u2019s] ability to pay.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 545.11(a).\nMary B. says that her son still owes the government some $16,000.00 in restitution for his crimes and that he indeed wants to make a dent in his debt while he\u2019s incarcerated but only makes roughly $20.00 a month picking up trash in the prison yard. It\u2019s nowhere near enough to meet the $200.00 a month payment demanded by administrators at his prison.\nSo how does BOP staff make such exorbitant demands for funds? Well, for starters, the relevant regulations set forth no formula or guidelines as to what constitutes a \u201ccommensurate\u201d payment. The decision as to how much a prisoner is expected to pay is made at the local level, by front-line \u201ccorrectional counselors\u201d at a prisoner\u2019s housing unit. In Mary\u2019s son\u2019s case, the counselor in his housing unit makes it her practice to simply add up the prisoner\u2019s incoming funds for the prior six months, subtract $70 per month from this amount so that the inmate can still call home, and, after deducting IFRP payments from the total, dividing by six to set a monthly payment figure. The counselor\u2019s practice appears based on the IFRP regulation\u2019s reference to using a six-month figure as to the basis for figuring a \u201ccommensurate\u201d payment. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 545.11(b).\nUnder this method of computation, Mary\u2019s son could just make sure his inmate account never exceeds the deductible amount, never buying anything or using any services, thereby reducing his payment the next time.\nThe catch is that in today\u2019s Federal Bureau of Prisons, inmates are required to pay for virtually everything. And \u201ceverything\u201d is, of course, expensive. Soap at a dollar a bar. Four dollars for toothpaste. Those who wish to exercise must buy sneakers at $50.00 to $80.00 a pair. Pursuant to federal policy, items are sold to prisoners at a 30% markup, inflating prices well above retail ones. Naturally, the BOP\u2019s 200 or so institution\u2019s purchase from only two vendors, Union Supply Co., and Bob Barker Company, two corporations that deal exclusively with correctional systems. (Business is, obviously, booming).\n28 C.F.R. \u00a7 545.11(d).\nWhile the application of such punishments \u2014 some of them substantial \u2014 would seem to render dubious the BOP\u2019s claim that the IFRP is \u201cvoluntary,\u201d the federal courts have upheld this characterization, holding that no prisoner has a constitutional right to avoid such sanctions. See, e.g., United States v. Lemoine, 346 F.3d 1042, 1050 (9th Cir. 2008)(consequences for nonparticipation in IFRP does not constitute an atypical and significant hardship for prisoners in relation to ordinary prison life).<|endoftext|>The prescient John Allen says a moto proprio on marriage is forthcoming, in which the Holy Father will comment also on liturgy, if briefly.\nThe striking thing is that the Holy Father speaks of \u2018continuity\u2019 in a highly idealistic, even fictituous way \u2013 let\u2019s sketch out a vision of continuity with 1965 as if the last 45 years never happened; let\u2019s dream about how the reform should have happened but didn\u2019t.

My husband is too tired and stressed to help out. And schools and playgroups are shut.\nLast year when I was pregnant it was hell, 4 days of hell, I was crying myself to sleep at night, my toddler was giving me hell, the weatehr was rubbish, and everywhere seemed shut.\nSo, my question is, does anyone know of any playgroups or playrooms that take toddlers and/or babies for a couple of hours per day during this holiday period? I cannot handle both for 4 days by myself, my toddler cannot bear me to hold the baby and just throws tantrums all the time, I need to take them somewhere where they can play and be happy.\nI'm extremely grateful for any suggestions.....\n1) playtown. there is an advert for playtown to the right of this thread, and i believe there was a thread on playtown. your toddler would enjoy it and you could play one on one with your daughter. might be best if you went with another family so your daughter could play with another friend. entry fee is very very reasonable, $100 a child, and i think your baby would be free of charge, but i am not sure.\n3) while school is still in session, get names and numbers of mums who are in HK for the CNY and make plans to get together during the break. that's how we've survived many a time! just a change of pace, being at someones house and playing with someone else's toys makes a great time for your 2yr old.\n4) when our four were very young we used to take them walking at the top of ifc during the cold months. this was a great way to get out of the house so cabin fever didn't drive me insane, yet to give them exercise.\n5) the police officer's playground is always fun, your 2 yr old can drive a tricycle there if he or she has one.\nas for your husband being too stressed out to help, etc...there is plenty you can all do that isn't too stressful. you can go on walks along bowen road, ferry trips to outlying islands like cheng chau...what about all the stress on you?? if you explain your needs and when you need him to be involved with the family, he'll likely come around.\na combination of swapping playdates with friends who have same age kids and getting out of the home will keep you sane. hope these suggestions help.\nGo for a walk in Tai Tam Reservoir, my kids always enjoy. I agree on HK park and the Botanical gardens. I am definitely planning to meet up with other parents who are here too.\nI'll be without a helper for four days too and have no intentions of making her work during her long holiday.\nWill be here for the CNY holidays too with a toddler and nothing to do so quite happy to meet for a picnic or a day out.\nChinese New Year Activities for kids?<|endoftext|>You can pay a professional to restore the porcelain plate, or you can easily repair it yourself. Use mild soap and water to remove dirt from the table. Rinse off the soap and wipe it with a soft, clean cloth. Remove any rust that has formed where the inner metal plate is exposed.\nHow do you polish a porcelain plate?\nOnly a small amount of glass cleaner is applied to the surface of the porcelain plate. Clean the glass cleaner with a soft cloth. After polishing, the board receives its final cleaning. So a wax can help it shine.\nSecond, how do you know if a plate is porcelain?\nTips for figuring out if an enamel sign is counterfeit: It usually starts with a white base, then any additional color is applied and baked. The point is that if you rub the plate by hand you will feel the layers on an original porcelain plate, you don\u2019t want a fake or a reproduction.\nHow do you get the rust out of porcelain dishes this way?\nHow are iron and rust stains removed?\nWet the bathtub, sink, ceramic tile, or toilet with a pumice stone and scrub the iron stain away.\nA paste made from borax and lemon juice is also effective on iron stains.\nRub the paste into the stain and let it dry.\nRinse with clean water and repeat if necessary.\nHow do you restore an old board?\nWood Panels Refresh the discolored parts of a wood panel by painting the parts with exterior paint.

If it is an original, the magnet will be attached to the board because it is made of steel. If the magnet does not stick, the board is likely baked on aluminum.\nHow do I clean old nail polish?\nStable stains can be soaked overnight in one part white wine vinegar mixed with two parts water.

This time we move a little bit further on the globe to reach the Asian continent. Let's follow Lucie through the highlights of her adventure through Asia!\n\"Three years after my first flight to Asia, I was sitting in the plane for another flight to Hong Kong: the city of skyscrapers, international food and shopping. Luckily for me, I have a local guide, my very good friend that I met thanks to ESN buddy network \u2013 I used to be her buddy when she studied in my city. She spent days and days showing me this admirable place. I would like to point out that Hong Kong is not only a metropolitan city, but also a rare place of diverse natural landscapes. For instance, in the Lantau island you can find a Tin Tan Buddha Statue with a temple surrounded by mountains. Alternatively, you can take a ferry to Cheng Chau island and walk around the sea. If you would like to get an adrenaline rush, go to a cave which is 20 metres long and only around half a meter wide. If you are not fond of spiders, a little advice: do not look around that much.\nHong Kong it is quite close to get to Macao: the Asian version of Las Vegas. In case you would like to earn some money quickly, try to gamble in one of the many local casinos. If you want to see something other than casinos, take a bus to the Peninsula de Macao. I felt like I was in Europe because of the Portuguese influence in the past. Go to the Ruins of St. Paul\u2019s and take a picture; otherwise no one will believe that you have really been there.\nThe flight from Hong Kong to Taiwan takes only one hour and 10 minutes. This small island, located in the Pacific Ocean close to mainland China, is also known as Formosa. Whenever I try to tell others how it felt to be there, I cannot say anything else than incredible.\nTravelling around Taiwan is very convenient thanks to its size and railway system. One of my favourite places is Hualien County which is famous for the National Park Taroko Gorge. On the way to Hualien, there are mountains on the left and the ocean on the right.\nThis time we decided to visit Mukumugi Valley and got sunburnt while swimming in the river. The place is unique, because you can meet aboriginal inhabitants there. If you are in the mood for something smaller, you can go to Xiaoliuqiu island located 30 minutes from Kaoshiung by ferry. The island is just perfect for swimming. Clear water, great temperature, but the best part is watching green sea turtles eating sea plants. ESN did not leave me even in Taipei, because one morning I had a breakfast with a girl who spent a semester in my university city and she told me that she would like to come back and work there. I could not have been be happier that day, knowing that someone would like to go back to my country.\nOn my way back I had a long stopover in Dubai. I was completely alone there. Dubai is a modern city with the world\u2019s tallest building, metros without drivers and huge, I mean enormous, shopping malls with ski slopes or aquariums with sharks, too. It was hard to believe, but photos do not lie and everything is real. It is impossible to be outside when it is over 40 degrees, so you just have to spend your time walking on neverending air-conditioned paths from one metro to an entrance leading to Burj Khalifa. My trip was supposed to be an adventure, so I went outside and walked around Dubai Museum and Dubai Creek and enjoyed the temperature.\nWith this unique adventure, I decided to start my own travel blog and share my stories and advice with the rest of the world, especially those thirsty for travel and eager to discover.\"\nWhat kind of adventures have you had outside of Europe?<|endoftext|>Motorola Radio Interface Cable used with a 130CUV-RI and a 2 Pin Motorola Radio.\nThis is the coiled cord that goes from the 130CUV-RI to your radio.

You get to fight some mobs that have occupied the vault and have nothing to do with the messed up things that went on there. Other than themed loot (i.e. drugs in Vault 106), you're mostly just kicking out some dudes with guns so you can read about the interesting things that went on and ended long before you arrived. That's dull and it's lazy, requiring little to no actual creativity or gameplay to experience.\n\nEdit: Too many 1's in Vault 11.<|endoftext|>This does not literally happen to people who live in dark wooded areas. There is not a truck fully stopped in the middle of the road in the pitch black with no hazard lights on. Who can predict this? \n\nLet\u2019s say it is a deer or a big rock instead of a parked truck. How are you able to see it in the pitch black in time to brake with incoming headlamps on the other lane - obscuring your vision? How can you make you the judgment call to fully brake in time when you are not able to even see the deer or big rock until it is about 10 feet away from your car? \n\n  \n\nAnother thing, not everyone is constantly on the edge, ready to brake to a complete stop to avoid hiting an unknown object at any given time. Just like no one expects there to be a fully parked truck on the road with no hazard lights on. Especially in this scenario when the oncoming light would have made it clear that there is an object in the lane I\u2019m driving on.<|endoftext|>Is not Iran an Islamic totalitarian theocracy? Do women there not have to wear tents to leave the house? Can they vote or leave the house without a male relative? Can they aspire to education and profession? Are they free to speak to whom they wish, when and where they wish? Is anyone there free to criticise the government publicly without repercussions? A few of the right sort of answers here and there is little difference between Iran and ISIS, for someone living there. You criticize your home country on one hand as an example of totalitarianism, then defend it as being \"better than ISIS\". Damning faint praise.<|endoftext|>Parents were semi wealthy fundamentalist christians. I was kicked out at 18 for sneaking my boyfriend into the house when he had no where else to go in mid winter, negative degrees outside and snowing. \n\nI was six credits away from graduating, only had 3 months of school before I would have graduated. I tried going to school for the last three months by staying in a nearby abandoned house, but kept getting detentions for being late. \n\nThe only reason I was late is because the windows in the attic of the structure were covered to keep out the cold. I was able to have a fully charged cell phone, but even if I tucked it in my bra next to my heart to keep it warm enough, it still froze every night and wouldn't wake me up in time. \n\nHe was sleeping next to me, if he wasn't there it is highly likely I would have died. \n\nWe got a bad case of bronchitis, and were living on less than 200 calories on a good day. I was so thin, I was able to stuff ramen packets in front of my size 2 jeans, without having it look bulky (when covered with a sweatshirt). I could see my ribs.\n\nMy mom always joked about kicking me out at 18. I knew it wasn't a joke, she would have made any excuse. \n\nI had actually packed bags in advance for this event, but my hands were tied, really. She had massive amounts of debt. No matter how large the sum of money, it was never enough. She told me flat out that if I ever got a job, she would subtract rent from my bank account. Bank accounts have to be under a parent or guardian's name, so I had no options. \n\nShe wouldn't even teach me how to drive so I could get my license. \n\nAfter all of this, I managed to hold down a job while homeless, and keep myself clean. \n\nWhen I finally had things under control, my entire family had a private investigator come after me. \n\nMy grandfather came to my place of work, and said they had evidence of us stealing, trespassing, and ect. Told us to leave because the police had been called. \n\nTl;Dr: Was homeless and kicked out three months before graduating, family spends money on private investigator instead of helping me.<|endoftext|>Really?

This song does a hell of a job with the shock you go through - that 18-wheeler still thinks it's in control, it doesn't realize its brakes are shot, the plane has instruments blinking, but they signify nothing.

It's a TN panel, 144hz/120hz strobed, 24 inch 1080 resolution.\n\nIt's price literally hasn't changed in 3 years. The reason for this is because the manufacturing process for this type of panel has matured and demand has risen dramatically since it's release. \n\nWe will likely NOT see any change in this behavior, especially for displays in any sub $500 tier for at least another couple of years. The reason is because 4K is the next hot resolution and until 4K production is stabilized and the price comes down, 1440p will be the premium stepping stone, and that's just for TN and VA panels. IPS and OLED panels will continue to carry a premium so high that they will continue to market exclusively towards professionals and not budget gamers.<|endoftext|>I was in full support of releasing it last time(just not the spammy, disrespectful hashtags, that people put on serious tweets), but giving Snyder 500-600 million dollars to finish JL2 and 3, is a lot different than giving 70 million to finish CGI to help boost a streaming service that didn't have content coming up at the time.\n\nThe truth is general audiences didn't come out to see it to garner that much investment, it did good but not great. If JL2 and 3 were made it would cost probably at least 400 million dollars dollars total, but snyder's dc movies have never been cheap so I doubt that would happen. Believe me I want to see the snyderverse restored really badly, but after all the numbers that have come out, it's not happening, no matter how many hashtags are sent. Money and streaming numbers speak louder than hashtags any day to any business. \n\n"

        "passage": " While it\u2019s a popular lunch stop for junks, it\u2019s often overlooked by other day-trippers. But the yummy seafood restaurants in the sheltered cove, plus the gorgeous coastal paths, fascinating rock formations and Bronze Age carvings put it high on the top of our list.\nThe old mansion Old Mo\u2019s Haunted House, built in the 1930s by a wealthy merchant family, is today in total ruin, making it a popular venue for young visitors and a place where imaginations can run wild.\nPo Toi is well-known for its rock formations. Don\u2019t miss the \u201cBuddha Hand Rock\u201d (a.k.a. \u201cPalm Cliff\u201d), \u201cCoffin Rock\u201d near Old Mo\u2019s mansion, and \u201cTortoise Climbing up the Mountain\u201d. You\u2019re going to really need to use your imagination to recognise some of these, but hey, that\u2019s half the fun!\nThe casual beachside seafood joint Ming Kee serves what we think is the best black-pepper squid in the world. Seriously yum. Beyond the scrumptious food, the restaurant sports a big covered wooden deck with three open sides viewing the sea. They also have a fridge full of Haagen-Dazs\u2026just saying.\nThe coastal paths along Po Toi make for a gentle and easy stroll \u2013 and the views of the South China Sea are tops. Many of these trails take you by the island\u2019s ancient rock carvings which are believed to date back to the Bronze Age and are declared monuments of Hong Kong.\nPerhaps the easiest way to Po Toi from Hong Kong is to hire your own junk \u2013 or get lucky with an invite. Otherwise, a ferry service is available \u2013 but on a limited schedule. You can hop on from Aberdeen on Tuesdays, Thursday, Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays, or from Stanley Blake Pier on Sundays and public holidays. You can also get a ferry from Ma Liu Shui. Get the full schedule here.\nMeaning \u201clong island\u201d in Cantonese, Cheung Chau is one of the smallest but most popular of Hong Kong\u2019s islands \u2013 and its charm and laid back vibe is positively infectious. It\u2019s a truly lovely spot to take children to let them experience the beautiful local island culture in full swing.\nCheung Chau is probably most famous for its Bun Festival, which takes place in April/May each year. The festival gets its name from the huge towers of buns erected outside the Pak Tai Temple where the main celebrations are held. The Bun Scrambling competition \u2013 which includes 9,500 buns stuck on a 14m tower \u2013 is something every child should see at least once.\nThere is sampan ferry service from the public pier (adjacent to the main ferry pier) through the harbour to Sai Wan Pier. The 10-minute ride is a great way to see the busy harbour activity, and you\u2019ll be dropped off within easy walking distance for the Tin Hau Temple and Cheung Po Tsai Cave.\nThere are a number of family-friendly beaches on Cheung Chau. We\u2019re fans of Tung Wan Beach, which is close to the ferry pier, and Pak Tso Wan Beach on the south side of the island which is bit more relaxing. And be sure to check out Cheung Po Tsai\u2019s cave where the notorious pirate is said to have stored his treasure (be sure to bring your flashlight).\nHit up the Cheung Chau Windsurfing Centre and see where it all began for Hong Kong\u2019s only gold medallist \u2013 windsurfer Lee Lai Shan. Take a family windsurfing lesson or rent stand up paddleboards \u2013 and when you\u2019re ready to call it a day, relax in their little bistro and watch the sun go down.\nBikes are perhaps the easiest way to access all the sites of Cheng Chau, and actually it\u2019s the main mode of transportation here. There are a number of bike rental stalls located a short distance from the ferry pier.\nTo get to Cheung Chau, catch the ferry from Outlying Island Ferry Pier 5 at Central Ferry Pier in Hong Kong. (The fast ferry takes 30-35 minutes). Get the ferry schedule here.\nAnother teeny island with lots to see and do, Peng Chau offers plenty of traditional Chinese character (temples, pavilions, teahouses) and a rural feel that will make Central Hong seem a million miles away. You can walk around the entire island in just over an hour (the whole island measures less than a square kilometre), making a visit here the perfect half-day adventure or even part of a full day of Hong Kong island hopping \u2013 in fact you can catch an inter-island ferry to nearby Cheung Chau from here.\nFor a pleasant walk through the village and surrounding hills, just follow the sign-posted heritage trail that leads you to a number of interesting historical and cultural buildings and sites including a picturesque Tin Hau temple built in 1792, a Qing Dynasty stone tablet, and the old Great China Match Plant, Hong Kong\u2019s largest match factory until it shut down in the 70\u2019s.\nTraditional teahouses are rarely seen these days in Hong Kong, but they can still be found here. Pop into one on Wing On Street, Peng Chau\u2019s main drag.\nPeng Chau is basically flat except for one small peak \u2013 Finger Hill. Meander up (it\u2019s all of 60 metres) and take in the panoramic views over the island, Disco Bay, Disneyland, Lamma, south Hong Kong island and across the Adamasta Channel towards Cheung Chau.\nHong Kong\u2019s outlying islands and seafood restaurants goes hand in hand, but if you want something un peu diff\u00e9rent, try Les Copains d'Aboard (\u201cfriends come first\u201d) \u2013 a little French bar and caf\u00e9 with a fab terrasse right on the town\u2019s main square.\nPeng Chau is serviced by ferries from Central Pier 6 on Hong Kong island. Boats mostly alternate between \u201cordinary\u201d ferries and \u201cfast\u201d catamaran ferries, so be sure to take note. You can see the full schedule here.

I think it's pretty amazing that for a while month every year, my city becomes populated by thousands of weird and wonderful performers - although after a week or two, I do get tired of how busy it is! Last year I went to quite a few shows, but this time I won't be around for much of it, and I only had time to see one show, so I had to choose carefully. In the end, my friend and I opted for Christina Bianco's show, 'Party of One'.\nSome people may be familiar with Christina from her YouTube videos - as I was - but for those who aren't, she is a singer and impressionist, performing songs in the voices of other singers. So first of all, her voice is astounding. Her impressions are impeccably similar to the originals, but she also plays up some of the more unique qualities of each one, to make it even funnier. As with all impressionists, it's better if you know who each person is, and by and large I did. She tends to introduce most of her voices too, to allow easier recognition, and often uses accompanying hand gestures and movements. The sheer number of different voices she imitates is also testament to just how good her vocals are, hitting a vast range of notes, and belting out some massive powerhouse moments - her movie medley included Idina Menzel singing 'Let It Go', Shirley Bassey's 'Goldfinger', and ended with Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On'. Her impressions are hilarious, yes, but those aside, she is an incredible singer, her voice rivalling those she imitates.\nI wasn't sure exactly how the show would be structured, as her YouTube videos are typically individual songs performed in a medley of voices, which would get pretty repetitive for an hour, but the show actually worked very well. There was a loose structure of her telling her life story about singing, and she came across as very personable and likeable throughout, which allowed her to dip in and out of songs throughout. Sometimes she would mention a singer then perform a few bars of one of their songs; other times she would do the whole song in various different voices; and she gave us a few of her 'Unlikely Interpretations', and I will certainly never forget hearing 'Bang Bang' in Julie Andrews' voice! We also heard 'Colours of the Wind' in Spanish, a highly impressive imitation of an opera singer, and extracts from Barbara Streisand's design book read as Keira Knightley and Penelope Cruz (sounds a bit odd, but it was hysterical!). She truly imitated everyone from A-Z - literally, as this was a recurring moment, where she would perform as someone for every letter of the alphabet, from Ariana Grande to Zooey Deschanel. Although there was a staggering number of different voices performed, it didn't feel confusing or chaotic, but rather kept things fresh and interesting. Also sprinkled throughout the show, were moments when she would perform songs entirely in her own voice, which was a nice reminder of herself as an individual, allowing her to showcase her voice, and assert her identity amongst the numerous other voices present.\nIt really was an excellent show, proven by the two standing ovations Christina received towards the end. In the past, I've typically gone to see comed"

We\u2019ve successfully built one garden earth brick bed at Winchester P.S., two at Rose Ave. P.S. and one at Gabrielle-Roy. The same students (grades 4, 5, and 7) that got to go to Fifth Wind Construction and see how earth block bricks are made in May were responsible for building them at each of their respectable schools. These building blocks are made out of earth \u2013 \u201cstructurally sound, and environmentally-friendly\u201d. They look fantastic and not to brag or anything (totally am) but my arms are a bit more buff (I call them dumplings)!\nWe\u2019ll be building more of these earth block beds with the youth that we hired for the summer with Youth Voices Research Group. July and August are looking to be excellent months and we\u2019re really, really excited to work with the 8 youth hired. They\u2019ll not only be constructing garden beds and building a rainwater harvesting system, but also be assisting in our garden programs, designing new activities, cooking, helping out at community events, helping with a balcony project, exploring community food security concepts and many other exciting projects. On the YVRG side of things, the youth will be researching and documenting food and health issues in St. James Town through various social media networking means, interviews and other creative outlets like photography.

With over 7.4 million people of various nationalities. The territory was originally a sparsely populated area of farming and fishing villages and has become one of the most important financial and commercial ports in the world. It is the seventh largest trading entity in the world, and its legal tender (the dollar of Hong Kong) is the 13th most traded currency in the world. Although the city has one of the world's highest incomes per capita, it has severe income inequality. The territory has the world's largest number of skyscrapers, most of them around Victoria Harbor. Hong Kong ranks seventh in the United Nations Human Development Index and has the world's sixth longest life expectancy. Although more than 90% of its population use public transport, air pollution from neighboring industrial areas of mainland China has resulted in a high level of atmospheric particulate matter.\nHong Kong International Airport (HKG) is the commercial airport serving Hong Kong, built on reclaimed land on the island of Chek Lap Kok. The airport is also colloquially known as Chek Lap Kok Airport. The airport has been in commercial operation since 1998, replacing Kai Tak Airport. It is an important regional trans-shipment center, passenger hub and gateway for destinations in Mainland China and the rest of Asia. The airport is the world's busiest cargo gateway and one of the world's busiest passenger airports. It is also home to one of the world's largest passenger terminal buildings. The airport is operated by the Airport Authority Hong Kong 24 hours a day and is the primary hub for Cathay Pacific (the flag carrier of Hong Kong), Cathay Dragon, Hong Kong Airlines, Hong Kong Express Airways and Air Hong Kong (cargo carrier).

Considering humidity, temperatures feel hot for about half of the year and otherwise nice with a fair chance of precipitation about half of the year. If you are looking for the very warmest time to visit Hong Kong, the hottest months are August, July, and then June.

Sleepy fishing village Cheung Chau comes to life during its annual bun festival, held on Buddha's Birthday - the fifth to the ninth days of the fourth lunar month, usually around the Western calendar month of May. Marked to honor the Taoist god Pak Tai, the centuries-old celebration is famous for sweet buns, with the event culminating with a Bun Scrambling Competition, involving the climbing of 60-foot bamboo towers.

You cannot miss Hong Kong when traveling around China!\n1. Temple Street Night Market - The stall holders in the Jordan area start their haggling when the sun sinks below the horizon. Night markets in Hong Kong are not as common as in other parts of Southeast Asia, which makes Temple Street so popular, selling traditional Chinese street food along with all the typical trinkets and souvenirs.\n2. Victoria Peak - Among the first things you need to add to your Hong Kong to-do list is the Peak, the highest point on Hong Kong Island. The cool mountain air made Victoria Peak the city\u2019s most exclusive area during the old colonial days, but the uninterrupted view of the spellbinding skyline is the main attraction today. The historic tram is the most scenic - and exertion-free - path to the top.\n3. Repulse Bay - Repulse Bay, located in the southern part of Hong Kong Island, is the most spectacular bay in the region. Its name comes from a 19th-century battle in which the British army repulsed attacking pirates. Today, the place is a luxurious residential area for dining, relaxation, and aquatic activities. Swimming is popular and the Repulse Bay is outfitted for safety with shark prevention nets and floating platforms. During the summer, lifeguards are on duty.\nFinding a ride to or from the airport in Hong Kong can be a challenge. Luckily, now you can book your airport"
