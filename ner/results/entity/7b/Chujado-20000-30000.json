        "passage": " individuals from Hongdo Island in based on analysis of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions (nrITS), and Hongdo Island individuals did not differ in sequence from C. denticulatum. Therefore, Hong-do-go-deul- ppae-gi has not yet been clearly identified taxonomically. Hybridization usually occurs in geographical locations where the parent species are sympatric. Hence, it is necessary to observe individuals in an area where C. denticulatum and C. lanceolatum co-occur. Therefore, Hongdo Island is unsuitable since only C. denticulatum is distributed in the region.\nMolecular markers such as the nrITS regions have been used extensively to investigate hybrid speciation. Although in some cases, the utility of nrITS is limited in plant phylogenetic inference (\u00c1lvarez and Wendel, 2003), the molecular marker has been very useful in identifying hybrid taxa progenitors due to its biparental inheritance nature (Sang et al., 1995; Li, 2006; Du et al., 2009; Les et al., 2009; H\u00f8ibov\u00e1 et al., 2011; Kokubugata et al., 2011). Since hybrid species originate by mixing genomes from two different species, detection of the parental genome in the putative hybrid taxa can be direct evidence of hybrid speciation. Furthermore, the addition of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) data can help the detection and indicate the direction of hybridization in plants (Rieseberg et al., 1993; Schwarzbach and Rieseberg, 2002). Hence, it becomes necessary to examine not only internal transcribed spacer (ITS) but also cpDNA.\nAdditionally, previous studies (Kitamura, 1955; Saito et al., 2006; Ohashi and Ohashi, 2007) have suggested habit, margins of cauline leaves, number of involucral bracts and florets as identification keys of Crepidiastrum hybrids. However, such identification keys are not adequate, and additional morphological traits need to be reviewed.\nIn the present study, to reveal the hybrid origin of Hong-do-go-deul-ppae-gi, its morphological traits were observed based on specimens collected from other regions along with Hongdo Island. One nuclear ribosomal ITS region and four chloroplast regions (trnT-L, trnL-F, rpl16 intron, rps16 intron) of the putative hybrid and its closely related taxa were analyzed. Finally, the morphological traits were described.\nTwenty-four individuals were collected from seven localities in Korea (Fig. 1). To compare the morphological traits of the putative hybrid and its closely related taxa, we examined living materials and herbarium specimens stored at the herbarium of the Korea National Arboretum (KH), National Institute of Biological Resources (KB), Inha University (IUI) and registered at the Korea National Biospecies Information System (http://www.nature.go.kr), the collection database of specimens and materials (http://db.kahaku.go.jp/webmuseum_en/). Morphological traits were observed visually and under a stereomicroscope and sizes measured using a Mitutoyo 500-196-30 Absolute Digimatic Vernier caliper (Kanagawa, Japan). Additionally, protologues, flora, and monographs were referred to.\nLeaf material from each individual was collected in silica gel for DNA extractions with voucher specimens (deposited in the herbarium of the Korea National Arboretum, KH). Total genomic DNA was extracted from dried leaf materials with silica gel using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted DNA was electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel to confirm the presence or absence of DNA. The concentration and quality of DNA were confirmed using a NanoDrop ND-1000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA).\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the ITS of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) and four noncoding regions (trnT-L, trnL-F, rpl16 intron, and rps16 intron) of the cpDNA was performed. The total volume of each PCR mix was 20 \u03bcL, comprising 15 \u03bcL of distilled water, 1.0 \u03bcL of each primer (50 mM), 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase master mix (Amplicon, R\u00f8dovre, Denmark). The primers used for PCR amplification and the PCR cycle conditions are listed in Table 1. In addition, primers ITS 2 forward and ITS 3 reverse (White et al., 1990) were used as internal primers for sequencing confirmation in both directions, particularly in the hybrids that showed nucleotide polymorphisms. The PCR products were visualized in 1% agarose gels and sequenced using an ABI 3730xl DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The determined sequences were deposited in GenBank (Table 2). Additionally, C, platyphyllum individuals deposited in GenBank were used for phylogenetic analysis. The analyzed nucleotide sequences were determined after checking the chromatogram using Geneious R 7.1.9 (Biomatters Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand). All sequences were aligned using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004). Polymorphic sites in the ITS region were identified by overlapping peaks on the chromatogram.\nMaximum likelihood trees based on the nrITS region and the combined four cpDNA regions (trnT-L, trnL-F, rpl16 intron, and rps16 intron) were constructed using the W-IQ-TREE Server (http://iqtree.cibiv.univie.ac.at/) (Trifinopoulos et al., 2016), based on user-friendly web servers for IQ-TREE 1.5 (Nguyen et al., 2015). Each aligned sequence dataset was tested to determine the best-fit model by using W-IQ-TREE with the Akaike criterion, and new model selection procedures. TIM3e was confirmed as the best-fit model for the selected nrITS and cpDNA regions. We evaluated the node supported by 1,000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates (UFBS) (Minh et al., 2013). Youngia japonica (L.) DC., which is most closely related to the genus Crepidiastrum, was used as an outgroup (Kilian et al., 2009).\nAs a result of observing the morphological traits, putative hybrid individuals were classified into three morphological types. All morphotypes had 10\u201312 florets but lacked basal leaves at anthesis. They grow on sunny slopes that were adjacent to mountains and coasts. However, Type 1 had herbaceous and erect stem branching in the upper part, mixed entire and serrate margins, 1.2\u20131.8 mm outer phyllaries, and achenes with 0.5\u20130.9 mm beaks. Type 2 had a suffrutescent stems with stout and short caudex, branched at the base, mixed entire and serrate margins, 1.4\u20131.6 mm outer phyllaries, and achenes with 0.2\u20130.5 mm beaks. Type 3 had a suffrutescent stem with stout and short caudex, branched at the base, mixed entire and serrate margins, 0.4\u20130.7 mm outer phyllaries, and achenes with 0.5\u20130.7 mm beaks. All three morphotypes showed that C. denticulatum and C. lanceolatum had mixed morphological traits (Fig. 2, Table 3). Type 1 and Type 2 were observed in Busan, Type 2 was observed on Somaemuldo Island, Type 2 and Type 3 were observed on Geomundo Island, and Type 3 was observed on Chujado and Hongdo Islands.\nThe sizes of the nrITS regions in C. platyphyllum, C. denticulatum, C. lanceolatum were 640 bp, 639 bp, and 638 bp, respectively. Size variation among the individuals within the same species was not observed. Four accessions of C. platyphyllum had identical sequences, while five accessions of C. denticulatum were grouped into three ribotypes (A, B, C) which differed at nucleotide position of 603, and five accessions of C. lanceolatum were grouped into three ribotypes (D, E, F) that differed at three nucleotide sites (200, 212, 434 bp) (Table 4). After alignment, a data set with a length of 641 bp was obtained. The length variation of the aligned sequence data was due to 1 to 3 bp of indels (insertion/deletion events). C. platyphyllum had 249 bp (1 indel) for the nrITS 1 region, 164 bp for the 5.8S, and 227 bp for nrITS 2 region. C. denticulatum and C. lanceolatum had 250 bp for the nrITS 1 region, 164 bp for 5.8S, but 225 bp (2 indels) and 224 bp (3 indels) for the nrITS 2 region, respectively. Excluding the gaps, the putative parental species showed sequence variation at a total of ten nucleotide sites. The pairwise-sequence difference between C. denticulatum and C lanceolatum was six nucleotide substitutions and one indel. C. denticulatum and C. platyphyllum differed by eight nucleotide substitutions and three indels. C lanceolatum and C. platyphyllum could be distinguished by six nucleotide substitutions and four indels. Therefore, the three taxa of Crepidiastrum were clearly distinguished in the nrITS regions. Among the putative hybrid types, Type 1 and Type 2 exhibited polymorphic ITS signals at those seven sites differentiating C. denticulatum and"

The number written on the top left of each block is the result of the operation performed with the numbers of the boxes in the same block.\nEach grid has only one solution.\nFor an addition, there are few possibilities, example \"5+\" can be written 4 + 1 or 1 + 4 or 3 + 2 or 2 + 3, it is blocks already found that will allow us to find the right addition. Still remembering the rule: the same number can only be present once per line and once per column.\nTo help you, a pencil mode is available to enter the possibilities of a box and so proceed by elimination to find the right number.<|endoftext|>President Deni, why did you sit with the Gedo peasant?\nWhy is this Gedoan \"Ugaas\" who called for the murder of Ahmed Madoobe visiting President Deni?\nMJ politicians are too kind and polite, they should gave him a plate of food and sent him on his way out.\nThis is how the rest of the Gedoan elders talk, excuse the surroundings, it's Gedo, you can't expect much.\nThis is the state of Siyad Barre's people, screaming into microphones whilst surrounded by mud and qashin.\n Puntites were the ones who gave Gedo hundreds of thousands of dollars in charity and even scholarships.\nThese previously naive but generous Puntites are finally realising that these people are their number 1 enemy.\nThat's why Dabcasar was scared and told his clansmen to shut their mouths but it's too late, MJs heard everything. Even that crazy Gedoan lady who calls us \"Jews\". Please keep talking. Love it.\nLook at how this Marehan woman talks about President Deni, why are they all insulting people's appearance. There is a difference between FKD kaftan and public speaking. So embarrassing.\nThis is a new low for political public forums. You will never catch Majeerteen politicians or elders being rude or hostile like this. This is why we don't associate with these people. But again, I love how they are exposing their true behaviour and thoughts publicly.\n\"Daarood\" kulaha, hana sheegan!!!\nI have to agree. Ghetto elders who use SSpot fkd in their speeches and call for the assassination of a sitting head of state should not be allowed the privilege to sit with President Deni.\nB\u00f6onta Sade have shown themselves to be the calibeesteens of Somalia in both culture and development, and should be dealt with as such. In Canada, we have a Minister of Calibeesteen Affairs that handles these communities. The Prime Minister never meets them. Puntland should do the same.\nI would send 'wasaarada durjogtada' to meet Sade, I would consider them apart of the wild life and create reservation treaties over gedo, meaning no political power and allow them to leave state-less and remain backwards while other Somalis are given citizenship status and b22n marehan given wild life status.\n Sheegato.<|endoftext|>The Coast and the Camino: The best of both worlds on this lovely trail around the beautiful north of Spain.
