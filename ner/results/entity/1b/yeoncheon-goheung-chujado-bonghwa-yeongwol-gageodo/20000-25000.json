Also, like the other vaccines, the J&J vaccine provided 100% protection against hospitalization and death from COVID-19. Medical experts observed that this level of protection against moderate to severe disease starts only two weeks after the single dose J&J vaccine.\nThe side effects observed during trials were mild injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle and joint pains, with a few reported fevers. These are similar to the side effects of your annual flu shot. This new Johnson and Johnson vaccine now joins the Moderna and Pfizer options as safe, effective protections against COVID-19, and incredible achievements of modern science.\nExperts emphasize that you should take any of the vaccine options given to you, because they all do the same thing, keep you protected from COVID-19!

This study explores these theories in a variety of intellectual settings, challenging our view of modern science as a straightforward successor to Aristotelian natural philosophy. It shows how astronomers dealt with celestial novelties by deploying old ideas in new ways and identifying more subtle notions of cosmic rationality.

The main reason of recession is in decline in demand for the built-in solutions: their annual sales were reduced by 17% to $2.94 billion.\nAt the same time revenue and from sale of analog chips \u2014 decreased by 5% (from $10.8 billion in 2018 to $10.22 billion in the 2019th).\n2019 the American semiconductor producer completed with the net profit in the amount of $5.02 billion against $5.58 billion profit locked according to the results of the 2018th.\nThe sales profit of analog microcircuits was reduced by 12% and reached $4.48 billion in 2019. In a segment of the built-in chips profit was reduced even stronger \u2014 by 25% to $907 million.\nJudging by data from the financial report, the lion share of sales of Texas Instruments is brought by orders from producers of industrial equipment. Besides, the company is one of the largest suppliers of semiconductor solutions for the automotive industry. Unlike Intel and Qualcomm, the company does not make chips on which development hundreds of millions dollars leave and which quickly become outdated. Such business model does Texas Instruments less vulnerable to the sudden fluctuations in demand or pressure of competitors.\nAt the same time sales to the company it was reduced in every quarter 2019. Texas Instruments warned that decline in demand for chips can last some more quarters as growth of economy of China slows down, and producers face effects of the prolonged trade conflict between the USA and China.\n2018 Texas Instruments completed with sales in the amount of $15.78 billion against $14.96 billion the previous year. The most part of business of the company is connected with production of the analog chips used, for example, for measurement of a sound, temperature, etc. with the subsequent translation of these data in a digital format.\nEarned $10.8 billion at the end of 2018 from analog microcircuits of Texas Instruments that for 9% exceeds an indicator of year prescription.\nProceeds from sales of the built-in solutions which can be met in the systems of Internet of Things personal electronic devices, etc., in 2018 were $3.55 billion that is 2% more, than the previous year. Other businesses brought to the chipmaker in total $1.4 billion turnover.\nDemand in China was lower, than in other regions \u2014 the vice president and the director of investor relations in Texas Instruments David Pahl in a conversation with analysts at the conference devoted to the publication of financial statements said. \u2014 Judging by signs which are shown by our clients, this weakness first of all is caused by the increased care because of intense trade relations.\nThe company also noted that orders from producers, especially in Celestial Empire, were low in 2018 whereas before demand was high thanks to deployment of networks of fifth generation (5G).\nAfter the publication of financial results the share value of Texas Instruments practically did not change. In 2018 quotations sank for 9.5% after six years of growth.\nThe American company Texas Instruments (TI) announced in September, 2012 that it will reduce the investment volume into development and production of processors for the applications installed in smartphones and tablet computers Reuters reports. Processors for applications which TI releases under the OMAP brand are the devices based on ARM architecture intended for start on the mobile device of the software including the operating system, the graphical interface and mobile applications.\nIn February, 2011 TI announced OMAP processors of fifth generation - OMAP 5. So far the new family contains only two chips: OMAP5430 and OMAP5432. Both processors contain 4 main cores executed on 28-nanometer technology - on two cores of ARM Cortex-A15 MPCore and on two ARM Cortex-M4, - which are supplemented by the multinuclear graphic PowerVR SGX544-MPx controller.\nProcessors of Texas Instruments stand in a set of popular devices, including, for example, Amazon smartphone Samsung Kindle Fire HD, Barnes & Noble Nook Tablet and BlackBerry PlayBook, Galaxy Nexus tablets and a set smartphones of Motorola company. Instead of continuing to develop the direction of processors for mobile devices in the company made the decision to be focused on the built-in systems, including the electronic systems for cars. The supplier is under serious competitive pressure from other American company - Qualcomm, the market leader of mobile chips on supply rates (sells processors under the Snapdragon brand).\nThe division which is engaged in chips for wireless communication sustains losses the third quarter in a row. In the last quarter it lost 53 million dollars whereas the same period of last year was complete with a profit of 78 million dollars.

Future Edge will serve as the hub in cooperating with other Fuji Xerox facilities inside and outside Japan as in the hub-and-spoke structure.\nUpholding its new value proposition strategy Smart Work Innovation, Fuji Xerox provides three values: Liberate from Restraints, Open Professional Expertise, and Transform to Creative Work-style. Future Edge is a place that embodies these values in the field of print communication, instead of being just a showroom displaying devices and related software.\nWith advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and robotic process automation (RPA), Future Edge will also aim to demonstrate how these technologies can contribute to enhancing the productivity of print operations and reforming workstyles by enabling people to grasp the state of print jobs remotely and automating workflows that have so far required human labor.\nWith approximately 7,000 square meters of space, this facility has the entire lineup of Fuji Xerox production printers, related software / services, as well as FUJIFILM Corporation\u2019s inkjet digital press Jet Press 720S and print workflow system FUJIFILM WORKFLOW XMF under one roof, to maximize the business synergy of the Fujifilm Group. The facility will also further accelerate collaboration with partners and innovators both in Japan and abroad, to continue introducing cutting-edge systems and expertise. By locating inside the Ebina Center, a base for Fuji Xerox\u2019s technology development, the facility allows not only sales personnel and systems engineers, but also development engineers, manufacturing personnel and Fuji Xerox\u2019s partners to work directly with customers to address challenges and verifications.\nTo create more added value upon the print value chain, Fuji Xerox believes that under the concept of Smile Curve (illustrated on the right), it is important to connect all processes seamlessly, from upstream creative and printing processes to downstream tail-end and delivery processes.\nFuture Edge comprises the Smile Garden\u2014a place to offer experience with, and verify, communication-related ideas and systems\u2014, and the Smart Factory\u2014a place to clarify various needs for digital printing deriving from such ideas and systems and demonstrate seamless processing and delivery.\nThe Smile Garden is a place to consider ways of communication in a community of diverse people and explore desirable business models together with customers. With constantly upgraded systems useful for establishing better communications based on a wide variety of applications and cloud services, this section aims to develop hypotheses about new business models together with customers by holding workshops featuring hands-on experiences. In addition, open innovation events will be held here to find business seeds leading to technological innovations by recruiting participants from the outside to brainstorm ideas.\nThe Smart Factory offers experience with, and demonstrates, productivity reforms in a future printing factory. Productivity can be enhanced by visualizing the entire print workflow with the latest technologies, utilizing various digital presses and post-print processing systems installed here. Digital contents created at the Smile Garden are sent to the Smart Factory\u2014which represents the production process on the Smile Curve\u2014to produce and process printed matters per various uses. The Smart Factory aims to build a system for delivering completed products to people who need them on time to the right place in the right form. To that end, Fuji Xerox and Fujifilm collaborate to provide an integrated printing workflow consisting of digital and offset printing for seamless workflow straight from upstream to downstream processes.\nThe increasingly diversifying preferences and values of people due to changes in the social environment and globalization require more diverse communication means.

About 12 million Syrians are facing a deadly winter without heating fuel, gasoline for transportation, and dark houses each evening without electricity. Aleppo, Homs, and Hama are also extremely cold all winter.\nImagine being ill and having to walk to the doctor or hospital. The ambulances in Syria will now respond only to the most life-threatening calls because they must conserve gasoline, or face running out entirely. Gasoline on the black market costs Syrians an equivalent of 50 U.S. dollars for a tank of 20-liter fuel.\nSanctions against Syria were imposed by the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia, Switzerland, the Arab League, as well as other countries beginning in 2011. The sanctions were aimed at overthrowing the Syrian government, by depriving it of its resources. U.S.-sponsored \u2018regime change\u2019 has failed but the sanctions were never lifted.\nFor 12 years the U.S. and EU have been imposing economic sanctions on Syria which have deprived the Syrians of their dignity and human rights.\nUN Special Rapporteur on human rights, Alena Douhan, urged sanctions to be lifted against Syria, warning that they were adding to the suffering of the Syrian people since 2011.\n\u201cI am struck by the pervasiveness of the human rights and humanitarian impact of the unilateral coercive measures imposed on Syria and the total economic and financial isolation of a country whose people are struggling to rebuild a life with dignity, following the decade-long war,\u201d Douhan said.\nAfter a 12-day visit to Syria, Douhan said the majority of Syria\u2019s population was currently living below the poverty line, with shortages of food, water, electricity, shelter, cooking and heating fuel, transportation, and healthcare. She spoke of the continuing exodus of educated and skilled Syrians in response to the economic hardship of living at home.\nDouhan reported that the majority of infrastructure was destroyed or damaged, and the sanctions imposed on oil, gas, electricity, trade, construction, and engineering have diminished the national income, which has prevented economic recovery and reconstruction.\nThe sanctions prevent payments from being received from banks, and deliveries from foreign manufacturers. Serious shortages in medicine and medical equipment have plagued hospitals and clinics. The lack of a water treatment system in Aleppo caused a severe Cholera outbreak in late summer, and the system cannot be bought, installed, or maintained under the current U.S. sanctions against Syria.\nIn 1998, Richard Haass wrote, \u2018Economic Sanctions: Too Much of a Bad Thing\u2019. He cautioned U.S. foreign policymakers that sanctions alone are ineffective when the aims are large, or the time is short. The overthrow of the Syrian government is a massive aim, and the sanctions did not accomplish that goal.\nHaass predicted that sanctions could cause economic distress and migration. In the summer of 2015 about half a million Syrians walked through Europe as economic migrants and were taken in primarily by Germany.\nThere is a moral imperative to stop using sanctions as a foreign policy tool because innocent people are affected, while the sanctions have failed.\nThere is a waiver that can be requested from the Department of Commerce, to circumvent the sanctions; however, it only applies to sending items to the terrorist-occupied area of Idlib. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham was the Al Qaeda affiliate in Syria and is the only terrorist group now holding territory in Syria.\nOn October 22, the media Energy World reported the U.S. occupation forces had smuggled 92 tankers and trucks of Syrian oil and wheat stolen from northeastern Syria to U.S. bases in Iraq. The theft is ongoing and continuous.\nThe U.S. has partnered with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) which is a Kurdish militia that has a political wing following the communist ideology begun by the PKK\u2019s Abdullah Ocalan.

But for him, it\u2019s more than just showing you his \u2018supermarket\u2019 - it\u2019s the culmination of three years of hard work scouring the country for the best artisanal farmers, who have also become his friends.\nIt brings life - and a heartfelt story - to the cuisine of a chef who set out to seek his culinary identity and found it in his own backyard. \u201cWhen I started Ryunique in 2011, I was very focused on technique first, and ingredients second,\u201d explains the 38-year-old who worked in Tokyo, Sydney and London for almost 10 years before returning to Seoul. While fellow fine dining chefs interpret traditional Korean cooking in modern ways, chef Ryu went the progressive Japanese-French route, \u201cshowing off\u201d, as he says, until a crisis of confidence caused him to do some self-reflection.\nHe started from scratch, researching and driving thousands of kilometers to visit new producers once a week until he finally had a go-to list of farmers whom he now visits once a month or every two months. It has given him renewed purpose as he streamlines his techniques to showcase the integrity of the product, while sticking to his modern Japanese-French philosophy. At the same time, he sees himself as an unofficial champion of Korean farmers, to provide a spotlight for them through his cuisine.\nWhen we first encountered Ryunique - and Korean fine dining in general - it was with a palate shaped by the largesse offered in Japan which we didn\u2019t think any other country could compete with, until we sampled his cooking. So when he invited us to tag along on one of his sourcing trips, it was an offer we couldn\u2019t refuse. Suffice to say, the experience was totally eye-opening.\nAt the historic inter-Korean summit in September this year, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un gifted his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in two tonnes of pine mushrooms, which is the equivalent of someone showing up on your doorstep with a lorry load of white Alba truffles, or maybe more.\nWe\u2019re standing in a makeshift warehouse surrounded by styrofoam boxes filled with the precious fungi, in the middle of nowhere - ok, Bonghwa, about a three hour drive east of Seoul where the terrain is mountainous and studded with coniferous trees. The air is clean and sweetly scented with pine. When the pine needles drop to the ground, the mushrooms absorb their flavour and become the highly-prized delicacy that can cost up to US$600 a kg.\nThe mushrooms cannot be farmed, which makes harvesting them quite treacherous as experienced hunters trek through the mountains to bring back sacks of them strategically tied to their bodies. Chef Ryu says, \u201cI tried to follow them mushroom hunting one year. It\u2019s very dangerous.\u201d Which is why he gets his stash from Hong Joo Sun, president of Byuck Chon Trading, a family-owned farm which has been harvesting pine - or Matsutake in Japanese - mushrooms for the past 50 years.\nThe family owns the surrounding land, and has a group of trusted workers - nimble middle-aged men who are probably more agile than urbanites half their age - who empty their sacks onto the newspaper-lined floor for grading. \u201cThe best quality are long, perfectly straight with small round caps,\u201d explains chef Ryu. Second-best are the same but shorter, while the third-grade mushrooms are bent, with some imperfections.\nMr Hong\u2019s farm used to bring in 1000kg a day during the pine mushroom season - which lasts just one month from mid-September to mid-October. That was before global warming, when the temperature in Bonghwa held steady at 11 degrees Celsius. Now, with temperature variations, the yield has dropped to 200kg a day. The Korean pine mushrooms are said to be superior to the Japanese matsutake, so you could be eating the Korean version in your favourite Tokyo kaiseki restaurant for all you know. We sample them raw here, just torn into large shreds, dipped into sesame oil and coarse salt. It\u2019s got a lovely, woody, clean fragrance with delicate flavour and firm texture. They are excellent in soups or grilled and most important, have health-giving properties.\nIn Bonghwa itself, all meat-lovers are drawn to Hanyakwoo Plaza (www.bhhywoo.co.kr) - which is akin to Korean barbecue paradise. Part supermarket and part restaurant, you choose your desired cut and quality of locally-raised beef or hanyakwoo, and bring your purchases to be grilled in the latter.\nYou\u2019ll notice in the foyer a display of medicinal herbs and grains, which is what differentiates hanyakwoo from the more familiar hanwoo, aka Korea\u2019s answer to wagyu. Bonghwa is famous for its Chinese herbs, and specialises in raising cows fed with a mix of oats, corn, nutmeg, mandarin orange peel, angelica and liquorice to supplement the usual feed.\nIt\u2019s the same for the beef, which is mostly consumed here and at Ryunique, where chef Ryu serves the top grade - 1++ (the equivalent of wagyu\u2019s A5 but not with the same level of fat) either grilled or shabu shabu-style.\nWhile Japan is way ahead in the wagyu game, Korea is steadily catching up, developing hanwoo that many swear is superior to wagyu because it is tender while retaining a natural beefy flavour. Wagyu is bred for marbling, so you get melt-in-the-mouth texture with not much flavour, a pet peeve of carnivores. Koreans, on the other hand, are afraid of so much fat, so the cows are bred more for the quality of the meat and tenderness with less marbling.\nThe farm that we visit is extremely clean, with well-kept animals that recognise the farmer who cares for them - so well that he can trace the lineage of each one of them, thanks to technology paid for by the government. The herbal supplements are also provided by them, and are supposed to improve the health of the cow, producing high quality meat that is rich in oleic acids. The taste? A sweet, rich beefy flavour with a very slight chew but still amazingly tender.\nNamwon is a small city in North Jeolla province, about 50 minutes drive from the old city of Jeonju, and the last place you expect to find a young South African working in a Korean charcuterie that makes the local version of Spanish jamon and salami.\nIn fact, both Andy Cremer and jamon are oddities in the small village near Jirisan mountain, which is famous for its Berkshire pigs and succulent fatty pork.\nMr Cremer, who is married to a Korean and was a former English teacher who somehow ended up in the country and never left, speaks the language fluently. He grew up in South Africa where he learned to hunt and cure meat and in a case of serendipity, joined forces with Oh In-suk, the lady owner of a pig farm specializing in Berkshire pork. It was she who went to Spain\u2019s Basque country to see how jamon is made and how it could be translated into the Korean context.\nThe company, Salmadang, is perhaps the only one in Korea making jamon from local pigs. The idea sparked because of Koreans\u2019 preference for fatty pork, namely the belly, neck and shoulder. \u201cLeaner cuts like the back legs are hard to sell,\u201d explains Mr Cremer. Because of the high altitude it\u2019s cooler, and windy, which are perfect conditions for curing meat.\nThey\u2019ve been doing this for the past three to four years, processing 200 legs a year, and they are planning to expand. They currently make jamon - which is moist and not as salty as the Spanish version, and delicious cured salamis"

Methods We conducted a case\u2013control analysis of 202 ADHD subjects and 159 controls, performed a transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) on 149 trios, and compared scores from the continuous performance test (CPT), the Children\u2019s Depression Inventory (CDI), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC) according to the genotype of the glutamate receptor genes. Results There were no significant differences in the genotype or allele frequencies of the GRIN2A rs8049651, GRIN2B rs2284411, or GRM7 rs37952452 polymorphisms between the ADHD and control groups. For 148 ADHD trios, the TDT analysis also showed no preferential transmission of the GRIN2A rs8049651 or GRIN2B rs2284411 polymorphisms. However, the TDT analysis of the GRM7 rs3792452 polymorphism showed biased transmission of the G allele (\u03c72\u2009=\u20094.67, p\u2009=\u20090.031). In the ADHD probands, the subjects with GG genotype in the GRM7 rs37952452 polymorphism had higher mean T-scores for omission errors on the CPT than did those with the GA or AA genotype (t\u2009=\u20093.38, p\u2009=\u20090.001). In addition, the ADHD subjects who were homozygous for the G allele in the GRM7 rs37952452 polymorphism had higher STAIC-T (t\u2009=\u20095.52, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and STAIC-S (t\u2009=\u20092.74, p\u2009=\u20090.007) scores than did those with the GA or AA genotype. Conclusions These results provide preliminary evidence of an association between the GRM7 rs37952452 polymorphism and selective attention deficit and anxiety found within the Korean ADHD population.\n\n\nBackground\nAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a disorder primarily characterized by inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity and has a worldwide prevalence of 5.3% [1]. It has an estimated heritability of approximately 76% and is thought to be a complex, polygenic disorder [2].\nAlthough the exact etiology of ADHD is unknown, one theory posits that the dysregulation of neurotransmitter systems underlies the pathogenesis and associated cognitive and locomotor deficits of this disorder [1]. Previous pharmacological and animal knockout studies have strongly implicated dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems in ADHD [3][4][5]. In addition, similar types of studies support involvement of the glutamatergic system in behavioral models related to ADHD. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed an increased glutamatergic tone in the frontal and striatal brains of subjects with ADHD [6][7][8] that normalized with stimulants and atmoxetine [9]. Dysregulated expression of glutamatergic pathway genes has been observed in spontaneously hypertensive rat models [10,11].\nIncreased concentrations of glutamate were also reported in the neurometabolism of ADHD brains, which is consistent with altered glutamate transmission in ADHD [8].\nGlutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and is found as a neurotransmitter in approximately 60% of brain neurons, including almost all cortical pyramidal neurons. Glutamate receptors are responsible for the majority of excitatory synaptic transmissions and plasticity in the central nervous system [12]. Because of this central role in neuronal communication and synaptogenesis, glutamate receptors control several cellular and cognitive processes [13]. Glutamate mediates its effects on the central nervous system via both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are subdivided into three categories based on their respective agonists, namely, a-amino-3hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid, kainate or N-methyl-D -aspartate (NMDA). The classic learning and memory receptors, NMDA receptors (NMDARs), are composed of heteromeric complexes containing an obligatory NR1 (GRIN1) subunit, plus an additional NR2 (GRIN2A-D) or NR3 (GRIN3A, B) subunit (Riedel et al. 2003). The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), which are G-protein-coupled receptors, are divided into 3 groups on the basis of sequence homology, putative signal transduction mechanisms, and pharmacologic properties [14,15]. The mGluRs in group I are mGluRs 1 and 5; mGluRs 2 and 3 in group II; and mGluRs 4, 6, 7, and 8 in group III. Group II and group III mGluRs are linked to inhibition of the cyclic AMP cascade but differ in their agonist selectivities. Among these mGluRs, mGluR7 is the most highly conserved mGluR subtype across mammalian species [16].\nThe NMDAR subunits GRIN2A and GRIN2B play essential roles in memory and learning by regulating key aspects of synaptic plasticity (Kutsuwada et al. 1996;Tang et al. 1999). Mice lacking the NMDAR 2A subunit gene GluR\u03b51 (the mouse homolog of the GRIN2A gene in humans) show increased spontaneous locomotor activity in novel environments, impaired latent learning associated with selective attention [17] and deficits in spatial learning [18]. Overexpression of the NMDAR 2B subunit gene GluR\u03b52 (the mouse homolog of the GRIN2B gene in humans) in the forebrain of mice enhanced hippocampal long-term potentiation, spatial learning and memory and improved learning processes involved in fear extinction [19]. Knockout studies of GluR\u03b52 indicate that this subunit is essential for development, neuronal patterning and synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices [20]. The GRIN2A exon 5 polymorphism was associated with ADHD in two of three family studies [21][22][23], and GRIN2B SNPs showed significantly biased transmission, with the strongest evidence of association found for rs2284411 in ADHD families [24].\nIt is of particular interest that the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR7 (GRM7) gene is widely expressed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, and studies have established a relationship between structural differences in these areas and ADHD [25,26]. Furthermore, mGluR7 has putative roles in anxiety, fear responses, and working memory [27][28][29][30]. Deficits in working memory have been identified as potential core factors in the development of ADHD, and anxiety is also a frequently associated condition. Although relational studies investigating GRM genes that encode mGluR have reported mixed results, a Genome-Wide Association Study examining the methylphenidate response in children with ADHD found an association with an SNP in GRM7 gene (rs3792452) [31].\nThe above-mentioned evidence suggests that GRIN2A, GRIN2B, and GRM7 represent candidate genes for ADHD or certain phenotypes of ADHD. However, the few association studies investigating glutamate genes have yielded mixed results, and all of the above-mentioned studies were conducted on Caucasian populations. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between ADHD and three glutamate genes: SNPs-GRIN2A exon 5 gene SNP (rs8049651), GRIN2B gene SNP (rs2284411), and GRM7 gene SNP (rs3792452). We conducted a case-control and family-based association study and compared the results of a continuous performance test and clinical scale according to each genotype. We selected these three glutamate genes because of their historical prevalence in the literature examining glutamate genes in relation to ADHD.\n\nSubjects\nWe recruited children with ADHD from three child psychiatric clinics at university hospitals in Korea: Seoul National, Kyungpook National, and Chungbuk National Hospitals. Inclusion criteria were (1) diagnosis of ADHD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR) [32]; (2) a score above the 90th percentile on the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ARS) [33]; (3) a T-score greater than 60 on the Attention Problems subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) [34]; and (4) an intelligent quotient (IQ) higher than 71 on the Korean Educational Developmental Institute's Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (KEDI-WISC) [35].\nIn addition, we recruited control group subjects from five different administrative regions in Korea: Seoul, Seongnam, Incheon, Ulsan, and Yeoncheon. The children were selected for the control group based on the following criteria: (1) did not meet the criteria for a DSM-IV diagnosis of ADHD according to the Korean version of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version-IV (DISC-IV) [36,37]; (2) scored below the 90th percentile on"

Interestingly, it is also the Feast of St. Martin of Tours, a Roman soldier who converted to Christianity after he cut his cloak in half to share with a naked beggar who then revealed himself to be Christ in dream. He is a Patron Saint of Soldiers, for example the U.S. Quartermaster Corps has a medal in his name called the Ancient Order of Saint Martin Award. To my Grandfather this was no coincidence. I honor his memory on this special day with a tribute to a great man who served our nation in World War II. He shaped me in profound ways and I think of his lessons and wisdom daily. On the subject of war I was schooled by a man who experienced it first hand. By the time I became aware of the concept of the non-aggression principle in college, the lightbulb went off on this important idea. Threat and physical violence or aggression against the person or property of someone else is wrong\u2026hard stop. Grandpa\u2019s stories instilled how evil war is and how terrifying it is to civilians and those caught up in its conflict. While I continue to struggle with the non-aggression axiom regarding some policies, when it comes to war, I remember grandpa\u2019s stories and it makes perfect sense. He would always say, \u201cwe can do better, we don\u2019t have to kill anyone\u201d.\nHarold \u201cDutchman\u201d Van Eck, was a Sergeant / Technician Fourth Grade United States Army. His active Service was from February 1943 \u2013 October 1945 in the 104th Infantry Division known as the \u201cTimberwolf Division\u201c He served in the European Theater of World War II and specifically in the campaigns of Northern France, Rhineland, and Central Europe. Earning the European-African-Middle Eastern Service Medal, Good Conduct Medal, D-Day Medal, and Bronze Star. I was fortunate to have such a great role model and listen to the many narratives of his time serving our nation during World War II. Two of these stories I share below. It is the responsibility of Millenials and Gen Z to keep the accounts of the WWII generation as we are losing these individuals every day. It will soon be solely our charge to pass the chronicle along so their sacrifice and lessons may never be lost to history.\nHarold departed for the War in Europe on the crowded RMS Queen Mary known as the \u201cGray Ghost\u201d. Before he shipped off, his mother, my great-grandmother, who was a devout Catholic \u2013 instructed him to wear a small medal of Mary Immaculate known as the Miraculous Medal because of the wonders that have been attributed to it. She said that the Blessed Mother would protect him, and that by wearing the medial he would have grace and heavenly comfort no matter the circumstances. In France, Harold credits his devotion to the Blessed Mother and wearing the Miraculous Medal over his heart on his uniform for his survival. It was his practice that before he would fire his rifle, he would lean over and kiss the medal, asking for Mary\u2019s intercession and forgiveness to her Son Jesus Christ. During a fierce battle in Northern France he bowed his head to kiss the Miraculous Medal and bullets went past his head. This happened on two separate occasions and the soldiers behind him did not survive. We remember their sacrifice. After D-day he is back in England, during some down time he prays a Memorare, followed by the words etched on the Medal, \u201cO Mary Conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to Thee\u201d while contemplating the Immaculate conception, Universal Meditation of Graces, and Queenship of Mary. Right after he finishes, a Lieutenant approaches him asking that he type up a letter drafted for command in Washington D.C. He quickly reads it and says, \u201cI can\u2019t type this letter\u201d. Taken back and insulted by the response the Lieutenant asks, \u201cwhy\u201d? Harold says, \u201cYou have run on fragmented sentences, dangling modifiers, double negatives, and verb tense errors. You can\u2019t send this to Washington, it\u2019s a disgrace!\u201d At that moment, General Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr. is walking by and overhears this rebelliousness from a soldier to a senior officer. He grabs the letter, skimming it over, then turns to Harold and says, \u201cRe-write and give it back to me, you have 3 minutes.\u201d Successful at this task, General Allen is so impressed he appoints him as his personal stenographer and said, \u201cno letter goes to Washington unless Harold sees it\u201d. Grandpa was thrilled to turn his rifle in for a typewriter. He contributed greatly to the war effort with this new weapon. Grandpa did not have a doubt in his mind that this event was divine intervention. He was certain his luck had run out and he would not survive combat if he had gone back to the front lines again. For this reason, he names his 2nd son Allen in honor of the General that pulled him out of harm\u2019s way for the remainder of the war.\nHarold returned home to Lodi, NJ to his new wife Florence. They wed in 1944 during a requested leave. My grandparents were happily married for 76 years. He took advantage of the new Servicemen\u2019s Readjustment Act of 1944 or GI Bill and attended Rutgers University and was the first in his family to earn a master\u2019s degree! He had a good career working at Westinghouse in Newark, NJ until retirement in his 70s. Grandpa raised 7 children, had many grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and extended family that were the center of his life. He was a great example of active community leadership. Serving in roles in the VFW, American Legion, Knights of Columbus, and his local Catholic Parish. Harold was a regular caller to CSPAN, and editorial writer to the local paper. He welcomed discussion and debate on every issue. Grandpa taught the importance of conviction for your beliefs, reason, and logic. A man of deep faith, he inspired countless people, was witness to true miracles, and spent much of his day in fervent prayer for the intentions of others\u2019 needs. His nickname in his parish was \u201cHarold be thy name\u201d!\nThank you to all our Veterans for your service to our great country. In no small measure, your sacrifice is why the privilege still exists"

        "passage": " military personnel. However, while malaria cases among the civilian population increased through 2000 in most counties, they decreased in the Republic of Korea Army population adjacent to the DMZ during 1999 (Paju, Yeonchon, and Cheolwon Counties) and 2000 (Paju, Goyang, and Gimpo Counties). Although malaria cases in the Republic of Korea Army increased in Yeonchon and Cheolwon Counties in 2000, they were still less than the numbers of cases detected in 1998.\nMost malaria cases were diagnosed from June through September, with a unimodal peak in August-September (Figure 2). However, during 1999 and 2000, the incidence reached its peak in late May, decreased by late/mid June after chemoprophylaxis was initiated in military populations, then peaked again in mid-July, and maintained a high level until late August when the number of cases decreased, as in previous years.\nTo determine when malaria transmission from humans to mosquitoes to humans had begun to occur, we examined cases with a short incubation period among Republic of Korea Army soldiers who 1) contracted malaria and 2) had been exposed to malaria for only one season (they entered military service in or after November of the previous year). The results show that the first cases of malaria with a short incubation period due to infected mosquitoes occurred in early June (Figure 3).\nThe Republic of Korea military initiated chloroquine chemoprophylaxis to nearly 16,000 soldiers in 1997 (Table 3). The number of soldiers given chemoprophylaxis increased annually thereafter until more than 90,000 soldiers were given chemoprophylaxis by 2000. At the annual termination of chloroquine chemoprophylaxis, a two-week regimen of 15 mg of primaquine was provided to soldiers who were given chloroquine chemotherapy to eliminate latent liver parasite stages.\nSimilarly, the Eighth U.S. Army provided limited chemoprophylaxis to its military personnel during 1997 and initiated a chemoprophylaxis policy that expanded drug usage for U.S. soldiers in 1998, with 8,780 soldiers given chemoprophylaxis by 1999 (Table 3). However, the chemoprophylaxis policy was changed in 2000 to include only those soldiers (1,159) who resided north of the Imjin River. The numbers of U.S. military personnel given chemoprophylaxis were reduced to include only those that resided in a high-risk area, identified as north of the Imjin River. Soldiers who resided in low-risk areas trained in this area for brief periods, and there appeared to be more cases of malaria imported into the United States as a result of chemoprophylaxis use.\nBecause vivax malaria in the Republic of Korea has both a short incubation period and a longer 6\u201318-month long incubation (latent) period, many soldiers who were infected while serving near the DMZ did not experience a malaria attack until they were discharged and returned home or traveled to other parts of the Republic of Korea.15 Because of the mandatory 26-month military duty, most veterans who were stationed in malaria-risk areas were exposed to malaria-infected mosquitoes for two consecutive transmission seasons (May through October). From the time the first case of reemerging vivax malaria was reported in 1993, more than 3,400 veterans developed malaria by 2000. These veterans, as well as civilians who traveled to and from malaria-endemic areas, potentially serve as a source of secondary infections among civilian populations located in areas where malaria-risk was low or had not been previously reported. So far, however, there have been no known cases contracted in either military or civilian personnel south of the Han River.\nPatients are infective to mosquitoes several days prior to febrile episodes, as well as during and after the febrile period. Even after treatment with chloroquine, patients are infective for up to 36 hours after initial treatment. However, if chloroquine and primaquine are given concurrently, patients are infective for less than four hours after treatment.16 While the mean time from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis has decreased from 23.6 days in 1995 to 8 days in 2000,17 delay in diagnosis continues to provide reservoir populations for potential transmission from humans to mosquitoes.\nThe topography of Korea is comprised of approximately 70% mountains with intermittent valleys of various sizes. The Taebaeck Mountain Range is located in the northeastern half of Korea, extending from the Sino-Korean border through the DMZ and south, and dividing the east coast area from central Korea. The Kwangju Mountain Range forms a branch of the Taebaeck Mountain Range in North Korea, extending south and forming a central region barrier near the DMZ. The northwestern half of South Korea has fertile valleys where rice agriculture is the principal economic product, and forms the western corridor and the fertile western shore areas, including Inchon. These discrete valleys create the potential for geographic malaria foci that were shown to occur prior to the eradication of malaria from the Republic of Korea and since its reintroduction in 1993.\nIn addition, greater numbers of military personnel assigned to guard the DMZ are concentrated in valley areas (rice-growing regions) in preparation for armed intrusions, and are constantly exposed to biting mosquitoes while on patrol, training exercises, and other military operations. Troop movements from one foci to previously non-malarious areas or areas of low transmission of malaria increase the potential for the spread of malaria throughout the Republic of Korea.\nThe western part of the DMZ was one of the three endemic areas where active transmission of vivax malaria persisted longer than in other parts of the country up until the late 1960s.8 It has been suggested that malaria remained endemic and was maintained undetected in this area at very low levels until 1993, when the first reemergent case occurred, with a subsequent explosive increase in malaria cases. The other possibility for the source of reemergence could include malaria introduced from external sources. Recent studies demonstrated that genetic characterization of P. vivax parasites detected in Korean patients were similar to strains from North Korea, China, and east Asia,20,21 suggesting such introduced malaria as the source of reemergence.\nBy 1996, malaria in the Republic of Korea had expanded southward to Inchon, Goyang, Yangju, and Pocheon, which are several kilometers south of the DMZ (Figure 1), and beyond the normal flight range of mosquito vectors from North Korea.22,23 Cases of indigenous malaria were also reported in children who lived in Ilsan,24,25 a satellite city near the northern part of Seoul, and who had no travel history to malaria-risk areas near the DMZ for at least two years. Therefore, the occurrence of malaria in these areas strongly suggests that malaria had become endemic by 1996 with local transmission, regardless of its origin of introduction.\nUntil 1998, malaria had not expanded further eastward to Hwacheon, where the Taebaeck Mountains run from north to south, forming a geographic barrier to infected mosquitoes. However, cases have increased steadily in the Taebaeck Mountain area (Yanggu, Inje, Gapyeong, and Chooncheon Counties) since 1998. The initial introduction and spread of malaria in this region may have been due to soldiers/civilians introducing malaria into those areas after travel/assignment to malaria-risk areas. While transmission of vivax malaria among military personnel was limited south of the Han River, annual increases have been observed among civilian populations since 1997. These increases are alarming as malaria becomes better established and slowly spreads south.\nIn 1997, the Republic of Korea military initiated chloroquine chemoprophylaxis to nearly 16,000 soldiers (Table 3). The number of Republic of Korea soldiers given chemoprophylaxis increased annually until 2000, when more than 90,000 soldiers assigned to malaria high-risk areas were in the program. It was recommended that military commanders and their staff ensure that all soldiers took their chloroquine under direct observation to be effective. However, all administration of chloroquine was not conducted under direct observation, resulting in solders developing malaria as a result of either not taking the chloroquine as directed, or not taking it at all.18 Similarly, when compliance was observed in U.S. troops, no cases were reported. It is unknown whether soldiers discontinued prophylaxis, the levels of chloroquine in the blood of these soldiers were insufficient to kill the parasites, or whether endemic strains of P. vivax are becoming more tolerant/resistant to chloroquine. These are important issues that need further investigation.\nThe number of cases among soldiers and veterans decreased for the first time in 1999 since the beginning of the malaria epidemic. The decrease among soldiers occurred primarily in Paju, Yeoncheon, and Cheolwon Counties where chloroquine prophylaxis was increasingly emphasized. In contrast, malaria cases among civilians residing in the same counties, to whom chemoprophylaxis was not given, continued to increase. In addition, chemoprophylaxis was not provided to soldiers in Pocheon and Hwacheon Counties, where the number of cases in 1999 was five times greater than during 1997.\nIn 1999 and in 2000, a decrease in the monthly incidence of malaria was noted in June, when the chemoprophylaxis schedule was initiated (Figure 2). Meanwhile, in the military, the number of cases during the prophylactic period (June 7 through October 17, 1999 and June 5 through October 15, 2000) comprised 71.1% of the annual incidence in 1999 and 74.5% in 2000, respectively. In contrast, the number of cases in civilians during the same period comprised 86.8% of the annual incidence in 1999 and 88.0% in 2000. These findings suggest that chemoprophylaxis contributed to the decrease in malaria occurrence in military personnel in 1999 and 2000. However, the impact of chemoprophylaxis was rather modest.

The statement ardently calls on the compatriots from all walks of life in South Korea to turn out as one in the anti-US resistance.\nROK, US and Japanese officials on Wednesday suggested the DPRK\u2019s offer to freeze its nuclear program may help bring about a new round of talks ending on Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear ambitions. The DPRK\u2019s offer on Tuesday to suspend its nuclear power program as well as refrain from testing or making atomic bombs was more specific than its previous statements and appeared to inject some hope for a fresh six-way talks among the US, the PRC, the ROK, the DPRK, Japan and Russia. \u201cThis should be helpful in creating the atmosphere for a second round of talks,\u201d ROK Foreign Minister Yoon Young-kwan told a news conference. \u201cI think it may show that North Korea may also be starting to show a will to somehow seek a breakthrough in the situation. I think it is a good thing,\u201d Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi stated.\nUS Secretary of State Colin Powell said on Thursday that U.S. has \u201cgood, solid\u201d ideas with respect to security assurances for DPRK. Addressing the Foreign Press Center at the State Department, Powell stressed Washington is not willing to detail those security guarantees unless Pyeongyang presents a clear statement that they are prepared to bring nuclear programs to a verifiable end. Powell\u2019s comments appeared much less upbeat than his earlier remarks in the week when he called Pyeongyang\u2019s offer to freeze testing or production of nuclear weapons a \u201cpositive and favorable\u201d step. He also noted hopes for a new round of six-nation talks on the 14-month-old standoff with Pyongyang appeared to be improving but signaled that the U.S. policy was unchanged on demanding a permanent end to DPRK \u2018s nuclear aspirations because it would be like \u201cseeing the same movie over again.\u201d As diplomacy continues to resume multilateral talks involving ROK & DPRK, PRC, Japan, Russia, and the U.S., in Tokyo U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage hinted that the second round may be held in February.\nThe ROK is saying nuclear crisis talks could be pushed back to the middle of the year as the DPRK and the US hardened their positions. \u201cI hope the talks will be held in the first half of this year at the latest,\u201d ROK Foreign Minister Yoon Young-Kwan told journalists on his way to a cabinet meeting at the presidential office. Yoon was speaking after Washington rejected Pyongyang\u2019s latest request for significant concessions in return for a nuclear freeze and indicated how wide a gap remained to be bridged before talks can take place. The foreign minister said scheduling problems among the six participating nations effectively ruled out a hoped-for January date. But he gave no clue as to why a new round could be delayed until June or later.\n6. Kim Jong-il Hospitalized?\nDonga Ilbo (\u201cRUMOR OF KIM JONG-IL HOSPITALIZED,\u201d Tokyo, 01/08/04) reported that on January 8 a rumor began circulating indicating that DPRK leader Kim Jong-il entered a hospital in Pyongyang to heal his chronic enteritis back in October 2003. According to the source, in October 2003 Kim received medical treatment at Bonghwa Hospital in Pyongyang which is known to be equipped with the best medical treatment equipment and techniques.\nThe DPRK achieved tangible accomplishments in the information and technology industry last year, but the ROK warned that a high-level of progress will be unlikely unless the DPRK\u2019s nuclear arms issue is resolved. The ROK\u2019s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, said Thursday that the DPRK has made efforts to develop the information and technology industry as a core means of getting over its economic difficulties. The DPRK had since 2000 concentrated its efforts on developing software but shifted its focus to mobile communications, hardware and the internet, beginning last year, the ministry added.\nThe ROK Institute for National Unification, a government-run research arm, has drawn up its outlook for inter-Korean relations this year. In this three-part series, the JoongAng Daily provides a summary of the report. Relations between ROK & DPRK likely will enter a stable phase this year based on economic cooperation and civilian exchanges. ROK wants to continue a dialogue with DPRK in order to promote its engagement policy, dubbed the peace and prosperity policy by the Roh administration. DPRK, meanwhile, has no reason to give up the ROK\u2019s economic support, which provides up to $400 million annually.\nThe ROK government has ordered a heightened security alert after a terrorist threat was mailed to its embassy in Thailand, officials said. Prime Minister Goh Kun asked his cabinet to strengthen counter-terrorism measures to protect ROK airlines, diplomatic missions and residents overseas, his office said in a press release. The order was issued after the ROK\u2019s embassy in Bangkok received a letter on Thursday warning of attacks on the country\u2019s assets and aircraft in Southeast Asia, the foreign ministry said.\nROK prosecutors have arrested the former campaign chief for President Roh Moo-Hyun in connection with an inquiry into illegal fundraising for the 2002 election. Arrest warrants are being sought for more lawmakers in connection with allegations that millions of illicit dollars flowed into the campaigns of Roh and his conservative opponent during the presidential election cycle. Chyung Dai-Chul, former chairman of the Millennium Democratic Party (MDP) who has since joined a breakway reformist group favoured by Roh, known as the Uri Party, has denied allegations that he received 400 million won (340,000 dollars) in illicit contributions from a construction firm.\nThe US accused the ROK on Thursday of failing to protect US-produced music and films against copyright piracy and elevated its seventh-largest trading partner to a priority watch list for intellectual property piracy. \u201cThe (Bush) administration is committed to protecting American creativity,\u201d US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick said in a statement. \u201cThe pirating of US intellectual property robs Americans and hurts those countries whose economies rely on innovation, technology, and investment.\u201d The decision to put the ROK on the priority watch list, a largely symbolic move used to convey US dissatisfaction, was based on a special review finished in late December.\nThe PRC told Asian diplomats last week it is not convinced of US claims that the DPRK has a clandestine program to enrich uranium for use in nuclear weapons, according to US officials who have been briefed on the discussions. Last week, at a meeting in Seoul between PRC, ROK and Japanese officials on the DPRK crisis, one of the most senior PRC diplomats dealing with the issue declared the PRC did not believe the DPRK had a highly enriched uranium program, according to US officials who have been informed about the meeting by the Japanese. At the meeting, the PRC official, Fu Ying, and her Japanese counterpart, Mitoji Yabunaka, were discussing a possible freeze of North Korea\u2019s nuclear programs when Yabunaka noted it would be necessary to freeze both Yongbyon and the highly enriched uranium program. Fu responded that the DPRK has denied having an enrichment program, and that the PRC also did not believe that it had one. She added that the US government briefing provided to the PRC had not been sufficient to convince the PRC that the DPRK had such a program.\nTaiwan is planning to broaden the scope of the existing \u201cmini three links\u201d with the PRC to ease growing calls for full direct cross-strait exchanges by local businessmen, a report here says. The move, expected to come into effect on March 1, would allow all Taiwanese businessmen in the PRC to travel across the strait by way of the Taiwan-controlled islands of Kinmen and Matsu, the Commercial Times quoted unnamed sources as saying. The \u201cmini three links,\u201d launched on January 2, 2001, refer to direct transport, commercial and postal links between Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu islands and the PRC\u2019s southeastern Fujian province.

It is expected to greatly contribute to strengthening our space defense capabilities,\u201d the ministry said in a release.\nSouth Korea plans to launch a homegrown solid-fuel space rocket carrying a small 500 kilogram satellite from the Naro Space Center in Goheung, 470 kilometers south of Seoul, in around 2024, it said.\nThe country is currently preparing to launch its first homegrown space rocket, named Nuri, using liquid engines next month.\nCompared to liquid-engine space vehicles, the solid-based ones are known to be quicker, simpler and more cost effective to launch.\n\u201cBased on the technology we secured through the development of the liquid-propellant Nuri space rocket and the swift development of solid-fuel space rocket technologies, we will be able to take a step closer to becoming one of the world\u2019s top seven countries with strong space capabilities,\u201d the ministry said, citing the United States, Russia, Europe, China, Japan and India as the others.\nThe government also plans to transfer its newly developed space technologies to the private sector to help boost its space programs.\nAs part of the efforts, the science ministry said it will build additional infrastructure, such as a new launching site and a rocket tracking system at the Goheung space center.\n\u201cThe government will continue to push for the development of core technologies, establishment of infrastructure and improvement in systems to support the private-led space programs to boost the country\u2019s economy and competitiveness in the science and technology sector,\u201d the ministry said.\n\u0633\u0648\u0644: \u062a\u0639\u062a\u0632\u0645\u064f \u0643\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u0648\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u062a\u0637\u0648\u064a\u0631 \u0648\u0625\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0642 \u0635\u0627\u0631\u0648\u062e \u0641\u0636\u0627\u0626\u064a \u0645\u062d\u0644\u064a \u064a\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0642\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0644\u0628 \u0628\u062d\u0644\u0648\u0644 \u0639\u0627\u0645 2024\u060c \u0648\u064e\u0641\u0642\u064b\u0627 \u0644\u0645\u0627 \u0623\u0641\u0627\u062f \u0628\u0647 \u0645\u0633\u0624\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0646\u060c \u0648\u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0627\u062e\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062d\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u062c\u062d \u0644\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0631\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u062a\u0645 \u0641\u064a \u064a\u0648\u0644\u064a\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0636\u064a.\n\u0648\u0646\u0642\u0644\u062a \u0648\u0643\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u00ab\u064a\u0648\u0646\u0647\u0627\u0628\u00bb \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u0648\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0623\u0646\u0628\u0627\u0621 \u0639\u0646 \u0648\u0632\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0641\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0644: \u0625\u0646\u064e\u0651 \u0648\u0643\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u062a\u0637\u0648\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0641\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0643\u0648\u0645\u064a\u0651\u0629 \u0623\u062c\u0631\u062a \u0628\u0646\u062c\u0627\u062d \u0627\u062e\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u062d\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0642 \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0651\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0642\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0644\u0628 \u0644\u0635\u0648\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0636\u0627\u0621 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0648\u0642\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u062a\u0627\u064a\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u064a 29 \u064a\u0648\u0644\u064a\u0648. \u0648\u062a\u0645 \u062a\u0635\u0645\u064a\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0631\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f \u0644\u0648\u0636\u0639 \u0623\u0642\u0645\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0635\u0637\u0646\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0629 \u0635\u063a\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0623\u0631\u0636\u064a \u0645\u0646\u062e\u0641\u0636\u060c \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0648\u0642\u0639 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0637\u0648\u0651\u0631 \u0642\u062f\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0642\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0633\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0629.\n\u0648\u062a\u0645 \u0625\u062c\u0631\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u062e\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0631\u0643 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0639\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0642 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0633\u0648\u0644 \u0648\u0648\u0627\u0634\u0646\u0637\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0631\u0641\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u064a\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u0631\u0648\u0636\u0629 \u0645\u0646\u0630 \u0639\u0642\u0648\u062f \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u062e\u062f\u0627\u0645 \u0633\u0648\u0644 \u0644"

She is so flexible with her availability so that my husband is able to be there at every appointment and that he, in his hugely important role as Dad-to-be, is also included and involved. We are treated as a family unit from booking. His role is valued even if that means that appointments take place of an evening or weekend. I am shocked by how many fathers are excluded from hearing the tiny heartbeat for the first time as it happens at a pre-allocated time in the middle of a weekday where their employer doesn't have any legal obligation to allow them to attend.\nWhen I ask my friends how on earth they manage to get through all the information and their questions within the 15 minute appointment, they say that it is a bit of a rush. My appointments with One to One are always a minimum of an hour over a cuppa where I am able to ask all my (sometimes stupid) questions and where more importantly I get told lots more info than I could ever get off parenting websites about what is happening with the tiny life inside of me. Also as my midwife gets to know me, she knows what type of things I'd like to know, what my own concerns are and how I cope with those strange pregnancy related things that happen to us all. This is one of the key things of being with One to One which you just sadly don't get with the local community midwife team. My midwife knows ME. Not as a pregnancy statistic. Not as a 'risk factor', but as a pregnant woman. She knows what is normal for me.\nWhen you've had your baby you get advice (wanted or not) every way you turn, all conflicting and all ultimately pointing to the fact that every baby is different. If this is the case then every human is different. Every pregnant woman is different. So why oh why are we all expected to fit into the same structured version of maternity care and labour? Having a professional clinician who knows my \u2018normal\u2019 and me seems like the most logical, natural thing in the world. We build that relationship over the whole pregnancy with more frequent visits and checks as the pregnancy advances. As 'The Birth' approaches unlike so many of my friends, I feel calm and collected about what will happen, the fact that I am in control and have the right and confidence to question everything that may happen wherever I choose to give birth. For me because of the fantastic antenatal care, birth is something to look forward to and embrace as I am fully informed about what happens and how to make the process as smooth and comfortable as possible. It is one of the most powerful things a woman can ever go through and yet sadly for so many women it is one of the situations where they feel most powerless and out of control as a stranger takes the control of their birth. Being with One to One empowers you as a parent, both as a mother and a father.\nThis is the reason I chose One to One.\nSo many people think that One to One is just about the Home Birth. Home Birth happens because you feel confident, in-control and empowered to make your own decisions and be in your most safe and comfortable environment to bring your child into the world. Ultimately though, I know my One to One Midwife will support me in whatever decision I make about where and how to give birth with no judgement or negativity. It really doesn't matter what your birth plan is or how you intend to deliver. The care you get throughout your entire pregnancy and in those first 6 weeks postnatally is what makes One to One such a fantastic option.\nPeople often ask 'what\u2019s the catch? It sounds too good to be true'. I\u2019m almost at the end of my second One to One pregnancy and I've not yet found it.\nPost by Louise, One to One service user.\nWhy do I want the Continuity of Care that One to One Midwives provide?<|endoftext|>The implementation concept of virtual intermediate, so called intelligent systems, to Business to Consumer (B2C) applications enhances the flexibility of B2C systems up to a certain level.

The itinerary, though a 2D1N trip, was incredibly interesting and it consisted of.... RIVER RAFTING!!!! I was so so so excited and I couldn't wait to start this trip! We were to travel to a few places in Gyeonggi-do, such as Pocheon, Cheolwon, Yeoncheon and finally Paju.\nThe first stop we made was at Sansawon (Baesangmyeongjuga) in Pocheon which is a liquor museum operated by Baesangmyeongjuga. It has a first floor and a basement. The first floor of the museum showed different tools and records related to alcohol that were used to brew old traditional alcohol. There is also a brewing class which we took part in to make our own home-made alcohol!\nThe few ingredients used were water, yeast, rice, and a container. That's how easy it is to make alcohol... and of course, time! It is the fermentation of yeast and cooked rice in water over days, weeks and months. It has a certain type of sourness to it, and you had to add your own sweeteners to adjust the taste to fit your taste buds.\nFor our group mission, we were to make a video to promote these traditional liquor in Sansawon. I had purchased a GoPro recently and was really excited to try it out. Here's"

        "passage": ", protesters gathered for a second consecutive weekend to call for an end to US complicity with Israel\u2019s onslaught against Gaza. Last week, organizers say 50,000 people attended the national march on the White House on 2 August to try and stop Israel\u2019s attacks on Gaza and pressure the United States to end all military aid to Israel.\nWatch the video of the 2 August protest in Washington, DC above.\nDespite the protests that have taken place throughout the world condemning Israel\u2019s violence and occupation, Gaza\u2019s civilian population continues to be murdered and displaced in an inhumane open-air prison. More than 2,000 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 10,000 have been injured over the last month.\nProtesters in the occupied West Bank have been targeted with tear gas and live ammunition by Israeli forces during the last month of demonstrations against Israel\u2019s attacks. Between 7 July and 5 August, seventeen Palestinians in the occupied West Bank were killed by Israeli forces as protests over the slaughter in Gaza were held in refugee camps, villages and cities across the territory.\nPalestine solidarity activists rallied in front of the White House on 9 August.\n\u201cWhat we are waiting for here is for Washington [DC] to be free. What we are waiting for here, is for our president [Barack Obama] to hear our demands,\u201d the National Coordinator for American Muslims for Palestine, Osama Abu Irshaid, said at the 2 August protest.\nEnergy wasn\u2019t hard to come by during the demonstration but professor and author Dr. Cornel West\u2019s condemnation of President Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu set the mood for a passionate demonstration.\nOnce the speeches were over, many demonstrators carried caskets with a Palestinian flag wrapped around each of them to the offices of The Washington Post and the Caterpillar Corporation and then back to the White House.\nBrian Becker of the ANSWER coalition, an anti-war group, said The Washington Post has served as Israel\u2019s propaganda machine while Caterpillar helps Israel carry out war crimes and human rights violations by continuing to do business with the state, which uses its equipment to destroy Palestinian homes.\n\u201cThey [major media companies] can no longer conceal the fact that Israel\u2019s policies have never been about peace,\u201d said Becker.\nDemonstrators in Washington on 9 August called for an end to US support and funding of Israel\u2019s assaults on Gaza.\nThe peaceful demonstration began at 1pm, lasted for a few hours past the march and didn\u2019t completely clear out until 6pm. A handful of Zionists came to counter the protest at the beginning of the march but failed to antagonize the Palestine solidarity crowd.\nSpeakers in DC stated that this wasn\u2019t an issue of religion but an issue of human rights, a principle reflected in the diversity of the march participants.\n\u201cWe stand not with the level of skin pigmentation or ethnic identity. This is ethical, this is spiritual with political consequences. And that is why we do acknowledge the need for resistance under conditions of occupation and annihilation,\u201d West said to a cheering crowd in DC.\nIsrael\u2019s violence is being met with growing opposition in the US.\nOrganizers said most people arrived on dozens of buses from cities across the country like Chicago, Tampa Bay, Florida, and Richmond, Virginia. The protest received a lot of support from passers-by. Many joined the protest and began chanting with marchers after learning about the atrocities committed by Israel with the financial assistance from the US.\nYes, they are. And so is the US Congress. I'm glad to see the people of the United States and the world exercise their voices in opposition to the genocide taking place against the Palestinians by Israel and all who support Israel. These crimes against humanity are despicable and the world needs to show and demonstrate its intolerance for these war crimes being perpetuated against the occupied citizens of Palestine.\nAug. 9-10 protests in Washington DC, Cape Town South Africa, Birmingham, Dublin, London, New York, Olympia (Washington), Chicago \"and in multiple cities across Europe.\"\nhttp://rabble.ca/news/2014/08/.... Plus I gather there were also protests in Asia.\nThis is a worldwide movement. The more that people know this, the more effective these protests (and BDS) will be.\nNader Ihmoud is a freelance journalist based in Chicago.

Luckily, there are many smaller and more affordable home improvements you can make to transition your living spaces towards sustainable living. The best part is, you don\u2019t have to own your home to make the following upgrades. Even renters can make the following changes to do their part towards an earth-friendlier existence without having to worry about losing their security deposit when they move out.\nDon\u2019t forget to involve your kids, regardless of age, in your home projects. Kids should learn the benefits of becoming earth stewards from an early age. It\u2019s a lesson that will serve them (and the world) well in the long run. Besides asking them to participate in sustainability projects, explain why the family is pursuing them and what impacts they will have on the environment.\nTeaching them about recycling by helping them sort waste into the appropriate recycling bin when possible. You can also educate them about trash ending up in landfills and chemicals from waste leaching into our drinking water, and how recycling helps.\nAsking them to care for household plants by watering them and explaining the importance of plants and trees to the ecosystem.

If your dog\u2019s own collar is snug enough to not slip off his head AND IT IS SECURELY FASTENED, the Watercollar\u2122 will not slip off. The Watercollar\u2122 will keep your dog\u2019s nose above the surface of the water \u2014 even if he is completely exhausted or unconscious.\nIs it easy to put on?\nYes. Simply thread your dog\u2019s own collar through the loops of the Watercollar\u2122. Secure his own collar, making ABSOLUTELY SURE it cannot slip over his head. Join the hook & loop straps together and he\u2019s ready to go. If your WatercollarTM has a \u201cD-ring,\u201d thread the end strap through the D-ring and fold it back on itself. If you have further questions, please watch our video on how to put on the Watercollar\u2122.\nHow long can it be worn?\nYour dog can wear the Watercollar\u2122 all day, every day. The Watercollar\u2122 is an extension of his own collar. His collar is simply threaded through the loops and the Watercollar\u2122 hangs somewhat loosely around his neck. The collar is almost weightless, soft, and is filled with non-absorbent closed-cell foam. It is non-restrictive to the dog\u2019s movements and he will be cool wearing it, even on the hottest days.\nCan it be used to help him overcome fear of water?\nYes. The Hedz Up Pets Watercollar\u2122 was designed as a teaching tool, as well as for drown prevention. The buoyancy of the collar helps your pet keep his head above water, giving him the confidence he needs to become less afraid \u2014 even comfortable in the water. As his fear of the water and of drowning dissipates, he will be able to focus on your commands and enjoy swimming.\nHow can you get him to wear it?\nIf your little guy is not accustomed to wearing anything except a regular collar, and is not already a swimmer or familiar with the water, we suggest that you introduce the WatercollarTM to him on dry land, with some nice treats for a couple of short segments (maybe 10 minutes each). Then, with even MORE treats, slowly introduce him into the water. Unless you\u2019ve had experience with helping a dog \u201clearn\u201d to swim, we highly recommend you view some YouTube videos on \u201cHow to Teach a Dog to Swim,\u201d etc. You \u2014 AND YOUR DOG \u2014 will be glad you did!!\nHow do I launder the collar?\nOur Watercollars are made of 100% cotton fabric. They are completely machine washable in cold water. We recommend air drying in a shady spot to keep fading to a minimum. For best results, be sure to attach the Velcro-type straps together before washing. To lengthen the life of your Watercollar\u2122, after the dog has been in the pool, it is advised that you rinse the collar to remove the chlorine or salt, then let it air dry, fully opened lengthwise.<|endoftext|>The closure of the american chrome plated...\nHandle and insert black nylon.\nChrome plated brass for locks with square mm.8.\nComplete with lock white plastic.\nThe basis of mm. 94x59, height, team mm. 10.\nDim. mm. 135x58, height, team mm. 35.\nDim. mm. 100x60.\nmm. 34 x 28.\nZipper wire for watertight chrome plated...\nCylinder complete with key and fully...\nThe key is extracted is in position open or closed.<|endoftext|>What does ARPERSCOM stand for?\n[HRC was formed in October when the Total Army Personnel Command and the Army Reserve Personnel Command merged.\nOn 2 October 2003, the United States Total Army Personnel Command (PERSCOM) and United States Army Reserve Personnel Command (ARPERSCOM) were combined to form a single, unified command--the United States Army Human Resources Command.<|endoftext|>ROME \u2014 Activists opposed to cruise ships in Venice are seeking a meeting with the Italian government to argue that its latest proposal to re-route big ships away from St. Mark\u2019s Square doesn\u2019t address pressing environmental concerns about the fragile Venetian lagoon.<|endoftext|>North Korea restores the Red Cross link with South Korea used for government-to-government communications.\nThe South Korean Ministry of Unification announces that both North Korea and South Korea will march together under the Korean Unification Flag during the opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics.\nNorth Korea attempts again to launch a BM25 Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile capable of striking South Korea or Japan but is unsuccessful.\nNorth and South Korea exchange artillery fire over the border at Yeoncheon, prompting South Korea to order evacuations of its citizens in the area.\n2013 Korean crisis: North and South Korea agree to reopen the jointly-operated Kaesong Industrial Region.\nSuspected Boko Haram militants kill three doctors in the northeastern Nigerian region of Yobe.

        "passage": " subjected to chemical attacks when the government launched missiles laced with sarin in the area, killing over a thousand people \u2013 including many children.\nAlloush\u2019s early propaganda videos were overtly sectarian, urging the expulsion of Shias and Alawites from Damascus. Assad belongs to the Alawite minority, which is nominally part of Shia Islam, and who are considered heretics by Sunni extremists. He was also opposed to the Islamic State terror group, and lost many fighters in battles against the militants.\nSince then, Alloush sought to temper his views to appear more palatable to potential western backers, retracting the demands for the expulsion of Alawites in a recent interview with McClatchy, calling them \u201cpart of the Syrian people\u201d.\nIt was initially unclear whether Alloush was killed in a Russian or Syrian airstrike, but rebel sources indicated that the attack was Russian in origin. The Russian air force has launched over 5,000 raids since its intervention began.\nThe rebel sources said that Russian planes fired at least 10 missiles at a secret headquarters of the group, which is the largest rebel faction in the area and has about 15,000 to 20,000 fighters. One of the rebels said the group had chosen one of its top military commanders, Abu Hammam al Buwaidani, as its new head.\n\u201cAlloush\u2019s martyrdom should be a turning point in the history of the revolution and rebel groups should realise they are facing a war of extermination and uprooting by Putin\u2019s regime,\u201d said Labib al Nahhas, a senior figure in the main Ahrar al-Sham group.\nThe Assad regime is seeking to expand its sphere of control in the vicinity of the capital, and has apparently reached an agreement with Isis militants in the Yarmouk refugee camp in southern Damascus, through which fighters will withdraw from the area they occupied earlier this year.\nOnce home to hundreds of thousands of Syrians and Palestinians, Yarmouk has been besieged for three years by the Assad government, causing a major influx of refugees into neighbouring Lebanon in 2012. Isis took advantage of a power vacuum earlier this year, collaborating with Jabhat al-Nusra militants to take over most of the camp.\nAl-Manar, the TV station of Hezbollah, the Lebanese military and political organisation that is fighting alongside the Assad government, said preparations had begun yesterday for the militants\u2019 withdrawal. It said they would leave on buses to Raqqa, the capital of Isis\u2019s self-proclaimed caliphate, and the Aleppo countryside \u2013 both locations where the opposition is fighting Isis and has seized large swathes of territory from them.\nThe timing of the withdrawal, coming as the opposition places Isis under increasing pressure in northern Syria, raises questions about the government\u2019s broader strategy of weakening rebel groups \u2013 even those fighting Isis \u2013 in an effort to present itself as the only palatable alternative on the Syrian battlefield.\nThe SOHR said the government had agreed to the plan, brokered by the UN, which would see families of militants, wounded militants and civilians leave before Isis fighters depart the long-embattled neighbourhood.\nIt was the latest in a series of attempts to broker local ceasefires in an effort to bring about a nationwide halt to the fighting. Earlier this month, fighters in al-Waer, a district in Homs that was held by the opposition, evacuated the area in a ceasefire agreement that brought much needed humanitarian aid.\nIn a separate development, Russia and Qatar\u2019s foreign ministers said they would work to encourage talks between the opposition and the government. Negotiations are set to be held in Vienna in January in the latest effort to bring an end to the war, which has killed over a quarter of a million people.<|endoftext|>Start of clear, translucent skin![ Daily Brightening care! ]Provide whitening & vital energy while taking care of the blemish, freckles through Niacinamide (brightening ingredients) * Description above explains ingredient benefits.

According to the Korea Meteorological Administration, the average temperature rose by 1.4 degrees Celsius (34.7 F) over the last hundred years, with shorter winters and considerably fewer frost, when temperatures fall below 0 degrees Celsius. The rise in temperature has moved the center of apple production from Daegu to Yeongwol, Gangwon. The pollack in the East Sea have become a lost species.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change expressed concern that if global warming continues, the glaciers in the Himalayas would melt away by the end of the 21st century and sea levels would rise by 0.5 meters (1.6 feet), putting coastal metropolitan cities such as New York, Tokyo and Shanghai in jeopardy of being submerged.\nThe effective response to climate change is obvious. The solution is to reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses such as carbon dioxide. Yet countries prefer different methods of accomplishing this depending on their national interests.\nThe 13th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted the so-called Bali Roadmap last year. However, the roadmap was limited to preparing the framework for negotiations to reach agreements on climate change and failed to propose clear answers.\nTherefore, the exhausting process of developing follow-up measures to the Kyoto Protocol by 2009 will continue for a while. The outcome might bring tremendous changes to the economic order of the international community, possibly shifting from a fossil fuel-oriented economic structure to a hydrogen economy.\nKorea is standing at a challenging crossroad in the chaotic climate negotiations. At the moment, Korea enjoys the status of a developing country, which means it is not obligated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.\nKorea is the 10th-largest greenhouse gas emitter and has the 23rd-largest volume of accumulated carbon dioxide every year. As a member of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, however, Korea would end up facing severe criticism and international isolation if we try to keep our status as a developing country.\nUnfortunately, it is nearly impossible for us to initiate a new standard that suits Korea\u2019s situation in climate negotiations due to our political, economic and scientific caliber at the moment. We need to confront this reality fully and prepare an effective negotiation strategy.\nIn order to bend the negotiations in our direction, we should carefully build an alliance. As a member of the Environmental Integrity Group, a negotiation group under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, we have been seeking mutual action. However, the Environmental Integrity Group is comprised of smaller countries such as Switzerland and Mexico, and it is difficult to stand as a negotiation group against the European Union and the Group of 77, where developing countries are members.\nThe latest trend in climate change negotiations is represented by the European Union, which is leading existing UN agreements, and the United States, which has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol.\nUnlike EU nations that prefer a more drastic reduction plan, the United States opposes obligatory emission reductions and wants an approach based on technology and market economy. The United States is initiating the so called Major Economies process, which has participation from the 16 countries that produce more than 80 percent of the worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. This group includes Korea, G8 nations, China, India and Australia.\nIt is also leading various consultative bodies with emphasis on technology and market economies such as the Asia-Pacific Partnership, the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum, the International Partnership for the Hydrogen Economy and the Methane to Markets Partnership.\nThese groups consist of a few countries that produce most of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas, so they have a strong bond and can strongly influence the trend of international climate negotiations.\nKorea\u2019s role should not be limited to simple participation. It needs to create an alliance through the consultative groups and partnerships led by the United States.\nIn the long run, we cannot maintain our developing country status, and if we want to avoid the restrictive emission reduction obligation, it is more realistic that we participate in the groups initiated by the United States.\nIf all goes well, we can enjoy various economic benefits through market and technology-based cooperation. Moreover, neighbors such as Japan and China are also in the group, so we could move toward a regional effort in addition to the existing tripartite dialogue on climate change. Instead of taking a passive stance, strengthening our negotiation edge through a solid alliance is the best way to win the war on climate change.\n*The writer is a professor of international law at the School of International Studies of Korea University.

But it turns out that after the epidemic, more and more young Israelis, freshly demobilized from the army, prefer not to follow such a familiar path \u2013 to work in the security sector.\nIn conversations with senior officials of the Airports Authority and Israel Railways, a shortage of hundreds of security guards is reported and a number of common reasons why young Israelis do not work in this area are pointed out. Some do it out of convenience, others out of a desire for a \u201cmore serious\u201d work, others precisely because of the alternatives that have opened up during the coronavirus. \u201cGeneration Z is a generation that has more demands and less desire to work,\u201d says one airport official.\nIsrael Railways is now trying to combat this phenomenon, mainly because they are short of about 300 security personnel. Railway officials told Ynet that the full workforce is 850 guards, as it was in the days leading up to the corona virus, but now it is only 550 guards. Who are these 300? Some of them are former security workers who did not return to their jobs after the crisis, and some are young people who decided to leave the security service and wanted to get another job.\nIsrael Railways has done a lot in recent months to attract more young people to work: an annual grant of around NIS 5,000, the opening of training funds, higher wages for weekend work, and even an increase of more than NIS 10 in hourly wages, which at present it is 59.12 shekels, but the workers do not come.\n\u201cWe returned to full-time work in March of this year, but some security personnel have not returned and are difficult to recruit. This is a national problem for many organizations at the moment, today's young people do not want to work in security, but want to work in digital technologies or in a courier service,\u201d says Israel Railways' senior security officer. \u201cThere they work less stressfully and at the hours that suit them, and not in shifts, as we do.\u201d one job to another. \u201cThey come, but they don\u2019t like that they have to sign a contract for a year. It didn\u2019t happen before, before the coronavirus we didn\u2019t have a staffing problem, but the virus has changed the rules of the game. Today they ask, is there work at home? But this is not an area where you can work from home, so they are looking for another place.\nHe also claims that many did not want to return from paid leave at all: \u201cAs soon as the state began to give grants for studies and many stayed with their parents, who also help financially, the option to stay at home and find something else has increased. In general, today they have more opportunities, whether in the Volta or in another job with a more flexible schedule.<|endoftext|>The Oyez Lawyer Directory contains lawyers who have claimed their profiles and are actively seeking clients.

The metropolitan areas had an average deprivation index of -5.0 (SD, 4.4), the urban areas, -2.6 (SD, 5.7), and the rural areas, 7.9 (SD, 5.8), indicating that rural areas had relatively higher deprivation levels.\nAs seen in Table 2, the median age-standardized smoking prevalence for men in 245 districts was 45.9% (95% CI, 43.4 to 48.5%) in Gangwon-do Chuncheon-si and five other districts, while the minimum was 31.4% (95% CI, 29.3 to 33.5%) in Gyeonggi-do Gwacheon-si, and the maximum was 56.1% (95% CI, 53.3 to 58.8%) in Gangwon-do Taebaek-si; the IQR was 4.6% points (p), and the SD was 3.6%p. For women, the median was 3.0% (95% CI, 2.5 to 3.6%) in Gyeongsangbuk-do Andong-si and nine other districts, the minimum was 0.8% (95% CI, 0.5 to 1.1%) in Jeollanam-do Goheung-gun and one other district, and the maximum was 7.4% (95% CI, 6.5 to 8.3%) in Gyeonggi-do Dongducheon-si. The IQR was 1.6%p and the SD was 1.1%p.\nWhen considering both the districts and the income levels, the lowest age-standardized men smoking prevalence was in the highest income group in Gyeonggi-do Seongnam-si Bundang-gu, at 24.6% (95% CI, 20.6 to 28.7%), while the highest smoking prevalence was in the lowest income level in Gangwon-do Taebaek-si, at 59.8% (95% CI, 53.6 to 65.9%). The difference between the two was 35.2%p. For women, the highest income group of Jeollanam-do Jangseong-gun and two other gun had the lowest smoking prevalence, at 0.2% (95% CI, 0.0 to 0.4%), and the lowest income group of Gyeonggi-do Dongducheon-si had the highest smoking prevalence, at 13.0% (95% CI, 10.2 to 15.8%). The difference between the two was 12.8%p. The median value of the difference between the men age-standardized smoking prevalence of the uppermost quintile and the lowermost quintile income level was in Gyeonggi-do Bucheon-si Sosa-gu and three other districts, at 7.4%p (95% CI, 1.6 to 13.2%p). The minimum was in Gyeonggi-do Uijeongbu-si, at -3.7%p (95% CI, -9.7 to 2.3%p), and the maximum was in Gyeongsangbuk-do Uljin-gun, at 20.2%p (95% CI, 14.4 to 26.0%p). The IQR was 5.9%p, and the SD was 4.1%p.\nThe median value of the difference between women age-standardized smoking prevalence was in Gangwon-do Jeongseon-gun and eight other districts, with a value of 2.7%p (95% CI, 0.5 to 4.9%p), the minimum was in Incheon Metropolitan City Ongjin-gun, at -1.4%p (95% CI: -3.8 to1.0%p), and the maximum was in Gyeonggi-do Dongducheon-si, at 9.5%p (95% CI: 6.5 to 12.5%p). The IQR was 2.0%p and the SD was 1.6%p. The women age-standardized smoking prevalence and the income difference in the age-standardized smoking prevalence were the highest in Gyeonggi-do Dongducheon-si. Of the 245 districts, 236 districts had a difference in men smoking prevalence between income groups greater than 0%p (i.e., with the lower income group having a higher smoking prevalence than the higher income group), while in 239 districts, this was the case for women. When considering the 95% CI, 163 districts out of 245 had a men smoking prevalence of the lowest quintile income level that was significantly greater than that of the uppermost quintile income level, whereas this was the case for women in 173 districts. There were no districts where the uppermost income quintile had a significantly greater smoking prevalence than the lowest quintile.\nSupplemental Tables 1 and 2 show the 10 districts where the age-standardized smoking prevalence and the income difference in smoking prevalence were the greatest or the least. The men age-standardized smoking prevalence was high in Gangwon-do Taebaek-si (56.1%), Gyeonggi-do Pocheon-si (52.7%), Gangwon-do Jeongseon-gun (52.3%), and low in Gyeonggi-do Gwachon-si (31.4%), Gyeonggi-do Seongnam-si Bundang-gu (33.0%), and Seoul Seocho-gu (34.4%). For women, the age-standardized smoking prevalence was high in Gyeonggi-do Dongducheon-si (7.4%), Incheon Metropolitan City Jung-gu (5.9%), and Gyeonggi-do Bucheon-si Ojeong-gu (5.7%), and was low in Jeollanam-do Goheung-gun (0.8%), Jeollanam-do Muan-gun (0.8%), and Jeollanam-do Boseong-gun (1.0%).\nThe income difference in age-standardized smoking prevalence for men was large in Gyeongsangbuk-do Uljin-gun (20.2%p), Gyeonggi-do Anseong-si (18.0%p), and Seoul Mapo-gu (17.0%p), and was small in Gyeonggi-do Uijungbu-si (-3.7%p), Gangwon-do Inje-gun (-2.9%p), and Jeollanam-do Jindo-gun (-2.5%p). The income difference in age-standardized smoking prevalence for women was high in Gyeonggi-do Dongducheon-si (9.5%p), Gyeonggi-do Ansan-si Sangrok-gu (6.7%p), and Gyeongsangnam-do Tongyeong-si (6.7%p), and low in Incheon Metropolitan City Ongjin-gun (-1.4%p), Gyeongsangbuk-do Uljin-gun (-1.0%p), and Gyeongsangbuk-do Ulleung-gun (-0.9%p). The men and women age-standardized smoking prevalence and the differences in smoking prevalence between income quintiles for 245 si, gun, and gu can be seen in Supplemental Tables 3.\nFigure 1 (A and B) is shown the age-standardized smoking prevalence for individual si, gun, and gu. For men, parts of the northeast and the southeast of the country are colored in red, indicating a high smoking prevalence, while women showed a high smoking prevalence around the capital city, Seoul. The men smoking prevalence in Seoul was low overall, but the Gangbuk districts were relatively higher than rest of the districts within Seoul. For women in Seoul, a high smoking prevalence was seen in Gwangjin-gu, Yongsan-gu, and Mapo-gu. For men in Busan, the smoking prevalence in western areas, such as Dong-gu and Busanjin-gu, was higher than that of the eastern areas such as Haeundae-gu. For women, part of the western area, Haeundae-gu, and Gijang-gun districts showed a higher smoking prevalence relative to other districts within Busan.\nFigure 1 (C and D) shows the smoking prevalence inequality amongst income levels for each si, gun, and gu based on gender. For men, the differences in the southeastern districts and the northeastern districts were relatively large, while for women, the areas around the capital and some of the central districts had relatively large differences. In Seoul, there was a large difference in Mapo-gu, Yongsan-gu, and Gwangjin-gu districts for men, and in Yongsan-gu and Dongdaemun-gu for women. In Busan, men had relatively large gaps in all areas excluding Saha-gu, Sasang-gu, and Buk-gu, while women had large gaps in the Haeundae-gu, Jung-gu, and Seo-gu areas.\nTable 3 presents the correlation coefficients of the area deprivation index with overall smoking prevalence, smoking prevalence of the highest and lowest income quintiles, and interquintile income differences in smoking prevalence. Table 3 also shows the correlation coefficients between smoking prevalence and the income difference in smoking prevalence. For men, the correlation coefficient between the area deprivation index and the age-standardized smoking prevalence was 0.58 (p<0.001) for"

The energy in a motive fluid conveys the solid materials and blends them with the liquid. Specially shaped jet ejector heads ensure the solid materials flow well and no clogging occurs. The jet ejector is so efficient that it minimises the requirement for motive fluid.\nIt comes in various models, three of which are available from the warehouse at short notice. Liquid jet solids ejectors stand apart for their very robust and durable designs. Attractive conditions keep the purchasing costs for the customer low. Furthermore, K\u00f6rting places huge emphasis on applying high-quality materials and handling them in a highly skilled manner.\nThe solid flows to be conveyed and particle diameters determine where a standard liquid jet solids ejector can be used. Two basic types, each of which comes in two different types of material, are available for particle diameters of up to 8 mm. The mobile liquid jet solids ejector comes in a spheroidal graphite iron (GJS) and a chrome-nickel steel version.

The burial site at the military unit where the truck with pigs was parked is some 10 kilometers from the Imjin River.\nYeoncheon, a town in Gyeonggi Province, is one of the border towns that have reported ASF cases at pig farms since the first-ever outbreak on Sept. 17.\nExperts said the provincial government and the county office were apparently under pressure to proceed with quarantine operations in a swift manner.\nMeanwhile, authorities dismissed public concerns that the incident might contaminate sources of water in the Imjin River.\nThey claimed it would not pose any health risks as pig carcasses were already disinfected during the quarantine procedure.\nSouth Korea's agriculture ministry said it will inspect whether they abided by related regulations.\n\"The government plans to create a joint team to inspect all of the 101 burial sites to determine whether they are properly under management,\" the ministry said. It also pledged efforts to prevent drinking water from being contaminated by slaughtered pigs.\nSouth Korea has confirmed 14 total cases of ASF at local pig farms, according to government data. More than 300,000 pigs have been culled so far.\nSince Oct. 9, no new cases have been reported. But more than 20 wild boars have been found dead with the infection near the border with North Korea.<|endoftext|>GREENVILLE, S.C. \u2013 In conjunction with the City of Mauldin and Greenville County, Greenville Triumph SC today presented its case to local leaders for a new multi-purpose stadium to be constructed for the community.<|endoftext|>I stayed up to watch Grand PHA in the channel, but it was too dark to see anything really.\nWe entered the first Gatun lock the Friday 28th at 19h50 with 20kts in the back.\nGrand PHA was in the center with one monohull fixed on each side it was not easy with the wind but the good advices of our pilot we joined the lac safely behind a big cargo.\nAt 07h00 we began to cross the lake and one hour before to reach the Pedro Miguel lock we sailed with no sail engines on neutral at 3-4 kts because the time of passage has been delayed to 12h50.\nWe waited a big cargo finished his passage in the lock toward the lac to enter in the lock behind two little tourist boats and Grand PHA inside each locck was tied alongside a very little old passengers boat in wood.\nNow we are at anchor at"

The Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the decree Nihil Obstat on July 3, 2015 for the former and on October 5, 2016 for the latter. The Most Rev. Lazzaro You, Chairman of the said Commission, issued Decrees opening of the Causes on February 9, 2017.\nThe Most Rev. Lazzaro You said, \u201cBeatification of these martyrs will provide us with opportunities to remember God\u2019s abundant grace towards this land and to show thanks for it.\u201d He emphasized that the most important aspects in the tribunal's process is to venerate these martyrs and follow their examples. To these ends, he invited all the Korean faithful to keep praying for the beatification of these martyrs and to be truthful witnesses to the Gospel by living in the light of faith.\nOn March 14, 2017, the Apostolic Nunciature in Korea announced that Pope Francis had appointed Rev. Fr. John Kim Son-Tae as bishop of the diocese of Jeonju.\nThe bishop-elect, Rev. John Kim Son-Tae was born on September 15, 1961 in Yeosan-myeon, diocese of Jeonju. He studied philosophy and theology in the major seminary in Gwangju, where he also obtained a Master\u2019s degree, 1988-89. He was ordained to the priesthood on January 20, 1989 in the diocese of Jeonju. After ordination, he continued his studies and held the following offices: priest of the parish of Jeon-dong (1989-1990) and of the parish of Dunyul- dong (1992-1997); studies for a licentiate and doctorate in fundamental theology from the University of Fribourg, Switzerland (1997-2003); director of the diocesan Catechetic Institute (2003-2006); priest of Solnae parish (2006-2009); pastor of Hwasan parish (2009-2013); pastor of Yunjy-dong parish; pastor of Samcheon-dong parish (since 2016).\nThe CBCK held a ceremony, on March 23, 2017 in the auditorium of the CBCK, to mark the publication of the Korean translation of the Heinrich Denzinger: Enchiridion Symbolorum Definitionum et Declarationum de Rebus Fidei et Morum (hereafter the Enchiridion Symbolorum). This publication is a Korean translation of the Enchiridion Symbolorum, a compendium of all the basic texts of Catholic faith and morals from the second century A.D. to the year 2009, included are the Creeds and the Church\u2019s Magisterium. In particular, the book provides readers with a 180 page index of topics, facilitating easier access to and a more complete understanding of Catholic dogma. The valuable efforts of some professors of Suwon Catholic University have borne fruit in this fine translation, which was first proposed in 2003.\nThose who took responsibility for the translation process were: the Most Rev. Linus Lee Seong Hyo, Auxilary Bishop and Vicar General of Suwon, the Very Rev. Msgr. John the Baptist Shim Sang Tae, Director of the Korean Christian Though Institute, and professors of Suwon Catholic University: Rev. Jermanus Kwak Jin Sang, Rev. Joseph Hwang Chi Hon, Rev. Petrus Park Hyun Chang and Rev. Philip Park Chan Ho. Many other Korean theologians also took part in the production of this text. All the included texts along with their explanations are in accordance with the original German edition (44th). They were edited by the Editorial Team of the CBCK after being proofread by the CBCK Committee for the Doctrine of the Faith.\nLawrence Pak Chwi-deuk was born in Myeoncheon, Hongju, Chungcheong-do, and heard about Catholicism for the first time in his hometown. He studied the catechism with Saba Ji Hwang when he went to Seoul and then became a Catholic. On returning home he prayed fervently and tried to proclaim the Gospel to his family and neighbors.\nHe was transferred to Haemi and Hongju to be punished. However, during this time he never lost his faith in God or became discouraged. Less than one month after he was imprisoned an order was given to set him free. As a result, he lost the opportunity to die a martyr's death.\nFollowing his release, while keeping in contact with James Won Si-bo and Francis Bang, Lawrence Pak again practiced his religion and proclaimed the Gospel to his neighbors. When the Jeongsa Persecution broke out in 1797 once again the order was given to arrest Lawrence. Upon hearing the news he escaped to another area, but he gave himself up when he heard that his father had been arrested in his place.\nWhen the interrogation started, Lawrence Pak explained all about the Catholic doctrine point by point. The angry chief official ordered that he be tortured, but to no avail. After being interrogated and tortured regularly, he was put in prison for many months. In the meantime, a new chief official was appointed. Lawrence Pak was again interrogated by him, but he professed his faith in God just as before and as a result he was transferred to Hongju.\nWhen the faithful visited him the following night, all his wounds were miraculously healed. The prison guards thought it was magic, and they hanged him by a rope. He died a martyr on April 3, 1799 (February 29, by the lunar calendar). Lawrence Pak was about 30 years old.<|endoftext|>00:00 Breath of Wind Sows the Seed 03:05 A Body Turns to Eden 07:09 Feet into Soil 12:29 On the Flowers Face 17:21 The Pyre 21:24 Turning Field 26:04 Turning Field II Sunflower 29:23 Scorched Earth 33:46 A Collection of Ceramic Vases (Yves Saint Laurent Buried in the Garden of His Marrakesh Home).\nA Body Turns To Eden.

I used to so them below the knee (max was 700) but with these, despite the shorter ROM, I feel they require more pure strength starting with the hamstrings rather than relying on a larger leg bend and momentum which I definitely relied on with below-the-knee. I lowered to pins a peg compared to where he set it up last week. I'll do that next time too to extend the ROM and see where the comfort level peaks.

Definitely keeping the Gironda Dips in as much as I can to see what I can get out of them. My right (repaired) wrist was a bit sore too but it may have been from the wraps being too tight.

Qasem Soleimani, the architect of many of Iran\u2019s regional military campaigns in recent years.\nNasrallah spoke from an undisclosed location, and his speech was played on large screens for thousands of Shia followers in southern Beirut, interrupted by chants of \u201cDeath to America!\u201d The comments were Nasrallah\u2019s first since Soleimani\u2019s killing.\nIn a strong speech before lawmakers in Iraq\u2019s parliament, Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi said that after the killing of Soleimani, the government has two choices: End the presence of foreign troops in Iraq or restrict their mission to training Iraqi forces. He called for \u201curgent measures\u201d to remove foreign forces \u2014 including the estimated 5,200 U.S. troops.\n\u201cThe Iranian government is trying to basically take over Iraq\u2019s political system. Iran is bribing Iraqi politicians. To the Iraqi people, do not allow your politicians to turn Iraq into a proxy of Iran,\u201d the South Carolina Republican said.\nThe majority of about 180 legislators present in Parliament voted in favor of the troop-removal resolution. It was backed by most Shia members of Parliament, who hold a majority of seats. Many Sunni and Kurdish legislators did not show up for the session, apparently because they oppose abolishing the deal.\nKilling Iran\u2019s most powerful general \u2014 a step Abdul Mahdi called a \u201cpolitical assassination\u201d \u2014 marked a turning point in U.S. Mideast policy by elevating a conflict that had previously been more of a shadow war, and by putting in doubt the Pentagon\u2019s ability to keep troops"

Which is a shame, really, since it's awfully pretty.\nYeongwol also boasts a rare independent movie theater. Through some form of black magic they have access to first run movies at half the price expected in Seoul. Cool beans. This collage is dedicated to sixties South Korean films- other collages are present for other decades. Ah, the classics- A Student Boarder, Descendants of Cain, The Star in my Heart, and...oh I give up, the Chinese writing on the fourth one is just plain insufferable, even if that's definitely a famous poster. I don't have a clue how Korean people are able to figure out what the names of these old movies are when half of them are written in Chinese. Then again, most of them just don't bother.\nLastly, a trip to the art gallery. It's rather appropriate for a small, rural town like Yeongwol to have an exhibition honoring the people behind increasingly rare traditional markets.\nNot the big traditional markets that at this point are largely directed toward tourists, but the personal ones, with shopkeepers who sell you the meat and vegetables used for making dinner. It truly baffles me why anyone would choose to go to a large corporate store when so many of these markets are (or were) in walking distance of residential areas.\nThere is, of course, also normal art if that's what you're into. That's a lot of what makes a place like Yeongwol so appealing for walking tours.

It can be impossible to differentiate a gunshot entry from any other puncture wound unless a bullet is located. Wounds thought to be caused by gunshot often turn out to be the result of another accident. On the other hand, I have examined a horse for a puncture wound, radiograph the area, and been surprised to find a bullet.\nThe most important factor determining the severity of these wounds is the location of the entry and exit wounds and the structures that were traversed by the bullet. The caliber, type and velocity of the bullet determines the amount of damage to the impacted structures.\nThese injuries are life-threatening if they involve an important organ or structure, such as an abdominal organ or the lungs. Gunshot wounds penetrating the limbs may cause fracture or damage to joints or other critical structures.\nIf you suspect (or know) that your horse has been shot, note the location of the wound. If possible, assess your horse's general health using the Whole Horse Exam (WHE) and promptly call your vet.\nDo not apply antibiotic products to the injury, unless advised to do so by your vet. Do not try to remove the bullet yourself.\nYour vet will try to determine what internal structures are involved and monitor or stabilize your horse's overall systemic health.\nThe diagnostics and treatments your vet uses will depend on the nature of the wound and the structures involved. Your vet may use radiography, ultrasound or exploratory surgery to further clarify the extent of the damage.\nThey may choose to remove the bullet (or not) and might debride any badly damaged tissue. The more normal your horse's physical exam findings, especially after several hours, the less likely that vital organs are involved.\nWhere exactly is the wound and tell me more about it?\nHow do you know this is a gunshot wound?\nDid you actually see it happen?\nDo you notice other wounds?<|endoftext|>...I've been putting it off for a couple of weeks now, but today there was no alternative...The clippers came out and Felix was the first victim!\nA combination of warm weather now and chilly weather a few weeks ago means that despite rugs, their winter coats are coming through quite quickly, and with Felix being part pony he is already looking woolly.\nIn this sort of weather its all too easy for them to get very hot and dehydrated with hard work, so it had to be done.

It\u2019d just be him, alone with the unending stream of mental diarrhea that constitutes his \u201cthoughts,\u201d and no one to tell him how great he is.\nAgreed. The rallies will keep going, as they provide that pro wrestling energy that the maga type seem to be addicted to. But there isn\u2019t enough variety in those rallies to keep them packed.

The province is also crossed by the 145-km-long Military Demarcation Line (MDL), which starts at 38\u00b045' north latitude, in Hyeonnae-myeon in Goseong-gun to the southwest, to a site at 38\u00b020' north latitude linking Hyangnobong Peak, Mondong-ri and Gimhwa-eup. Gangwon-do is 150 km wide, from east to west, and 243 km long, from north to south, and has an eastern coastline of about 314 km. The province is bordered by five provinces, three cities and 13 counties, including Singye-gun and Gimcheon-gun in Hwanghae-do; Yeoncheon, Pocheon, Gapyeong, Yangpyeong and Yeoju in Gyeonggi-do in the east; Chungju-si, Jecheon-si and Danyang-gun in Chungcheongbuk-do and Yeongju-si, Bonghwa-gun and Uljin-gun in Gyeongsangbuk-do in the south; and Anbyeon-gun and Deogwon-gun in Hamgyeongnam-do and Goksan-gun in Hwanghae-do in the north.\nThe total area of Gangwon-do is 20,569Km\u00b2 of which the area south of the MDL is 16,873.51\u33a2, which accounts for 82% of the province's total area and 16.8% of the national territory of South Korea.\nThe total area of Gangwon-do is 20,569Km\u00b2 of which the area south of the MDL is 16,873.51\u33a2, which accounts for 82% of the province's total area and 16.8% of the national territory of South Korea. The province consists of the mountainous areas covering 81.0% of the total provincial area, including 13,665.66Km\u00b2 and farming fields of 1,668.69Km\u00b2, which accounts for 9.9%, and land for other purposes covering 9.1% of the total area, with 1,539.25Km\u00b2.\nGangwon-do is a mountainous province, (a much greater part is occupied by mountains)and is usually divided into two areas, Yeongdong and Yeongseo, with the Taebaek Mountains, which form the backbone of the Korean Peninsula, in the middle.\nThe area east of the Taebaek Mountains is marked by steep slopes with few coastal plains, while the western area is marked by gentle slopes and mountains containing the headwaters of some of Korea's largest rivers, such as the Namhan and Bukhan Rivers.\nThe percentage of low land (less than 100 meters high) covers only 5.6% of the total area of Gangwon-do, which is even lower than that of Hamgyeongnam-do where the figure is 9.6%. Low hills between 100-500 meters in height cover 43.1%; mid-height land between 500-1,000 meters covers 43.4%, a larger figure than for all the other provinces in Korea; and, finally, highlands taller than 1,000 meters cover 7.7%. Flat, arable land for paddy cultivation is largely located along the eastern coastal area around Gangneung and Bukpyeong and is distributed around Cheorwon, Chuncheon and Wonju in the Yeongbuk area. The northern part of the river basins feature steep valleys.\nThe Yeongdong area is geographically narrow due to the steep mountains facing the East Sea, but it contains several high scenic passes, such as Daegwallyeong, Misiryeong, Jinburyeong and Hangyeryeong, and deep valleys. The Yeongseo area features mountains and sunken lands all running gently towards Seoul and surrounding Gyeonggi-do in the west, and expansive highlands that offer dry fields rather than paddies and contain headwaters that flow into many streams and two of Korea's largest rivers, the Han River and Nakdong River, that wet a large part of the Korean Peninsula. The upper streams of the Bukhan River provide habitats for various fish species, including some of the rarest Korean native fish, and form well protected healthy ecosystems. There are in the area several famous dams: the Peace Dam, Hwacheon Dam"

As a leading tourist destination, the island was seen as an ideal test bed for air taxis due to its good airport facilities and well-maintained traffic infrastructure.\nUrban air mobility (UAM) is an ecosystem involving flying passenger vehicles in urban areas. SK Telecom and Hanwha Systems are members of UAM Team Korea, a public-private consultative body that will commercialize drone taxis in 2025. The two companies have formed a K-UAM Dream Team consortium with Korea Airport Corporation (KAC), the Korea Transport Institute and the Korea Meteorological Institute.\nSK Telecom said its consortium signed a business agreement with the provincial government of Jeju to establish a UAM vertiport and a traffic management system for a pilot service linking the island's international airport and major tourist attractions. The goal is to build a foundation for actually operating UAM in a complex urban environment.\nBecause Jeju is South Korea's largest tourist destination and has good airport facilities and infrastructure, it will be easy to secure public acceptance, SK Telecom said, describing Jeju as a good place to quickly commercialize a UAM service.\nFor a pilot service in Jeju, SK Telecom (SKT) is in charge of a communication system and a mobility platform. \"We will nurture Jeju, an eco-friendly tourist attraction, as a base for UAM innovation and develop it as a game changer for future mobility services,\" SK Telecom CEO Ryu Young-sang said in a statement on September 14.\nKAC, which operates and manages airports, provides a UAM traffic management service. \"The Jeju Island pilot project is will be an opportunity for South Korea to become a global leader in the UAM industry,\" KAC CEO Yoon Hyeogn-jung was quoted as saying. Jeju will provide a UAM operation site and creates a UAM ecosystem and administrative support.\nHanwha Systems is responsible for UAM aircraft manufacturing, operation, and maintenance while developing navigation and control solutions. \"The K-UAM dream team consortium will do its best to lower psychological hurdles for new transportation in Jeju, where tourism and cultural resources are concentrated, and lead the future mobility paradigm,\" said Hanwha Systems CEO Eoh Sung-chul.\nAlong with Overair, an American maker of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles, Hanwha Systems aims to produce an air taxi called \"Butterfly\" that can fly at a maxim speed of 320 km per hour.\nAs a top mobile carrier in South Korea, SK Telecom is involved in the development of a mobile communication network for air taxis. The company has tested stable communication quality at the altitude of UAM operation from 300 to 600 meters by using a quality measurement drone in a flight test center in the southern seaside county of Goheung.\nThe government has worked out a \"K-UAM Grand Challenge\" program to demonstrate the safety of air taxis and test traffic management functions. Air taxis will fly through corridors, or known as virtual channels in low-altitude airspaces, to prevent accidents and improve the safety of pedestrians on the land. SKT will build a pilot 5G sky network infrastructure near Seoul through collaboration with its American partner, Joby Aviation.<|endoftext|>Premium content. No speaking fees.\nAll content is educational, entertaining, and practical!\nHello! My name is Jeff, Founder and CEO of Forge3.\nBefore starting Forge3 in 2004, I began my career with an insurance agency my dad ran called Personal Lines Insurance Brokerage (PLI). It was a large, wholly-owned subsidiary of Chubb with more than 300 employees across 30 field offices. It was later sold to HUB International.\nI learned so much while there. I had a front-row seat to both the carrier and agency side of the insurance business and worked on web projects, agency management system integrations, and other marketing projects. This became the foundation of Forge3.\nI saw many of my insurance agency friends struggling to understand and use the web, apps, and digital marketing. I wanted to do something about it, so Forge3 was born!\n They rely on us to keep up with the latest digital marketing trends, strategies, and tools so they can focus on handshakes, referrals, and growing their book of business.\nThis is why I love to do keynote speaking presentations, educational sessions, and live webinars. It\u2019s so rewarding and gratifying to inspire the next generation of agency principals, producers, and support staff. The insurance landscape is changing. It\u2019s time to change with it!\nBacked by education. Powered by passion.\nOur business is not reliant on speaking fees, so it\u2019s one way we can give back and inspire the next generation.\nIt\u2019s a brave new world. People expect a great experience, how and when they want it. Increasingly, your job is to understand what\u2019s expected and how best to position your agency for the future. There are so many powerful web tools, apps, and other tech. But they\u2019re all useless unless you know about them, embrace change, and start implementing them! This is the only way to compete and thrive against direct writers, insurtech startups, and other threats. Come with an open mind, leave inspired, and be ready to do something the very next day!\nIs your website working for you or is it just existing? It\u2019s no longer enough to just have a website. Does yours have live chat? How about interactive sales tools? Forms? Client portal? Do you use video proposals? Stop by and see all of the latest web tools and tech that people are expecting from your agency. Leave inspired and ready to make changes at your agency!\nSpeaking of speaking, let\u2019s talk about your event!\nKnowledge is power. Learning is beautiful. Inspiration is priceless.\n\u201dIf we weren\u2019t leveraging digital tools and technology, we\u2019d simply be associated with a black-and-white policy that shows up in the mailbox once a year.\n\u201dTechnology isn\u2019t going away. Agents who embrace it and welcome it into their prospecting and services approach will be the winners.\n\u201dThe beauty of technology isn\u2019t always the product itself. It\u2019s the collaborative spirit of the people behind the technology.

They\u2019re God fearing people.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what is going on but it is nice to see a total stranger, heavyweight champion of the world, coming here and respecting people and paying homage to their beliefs and special days.\nThe Gypsy King came out for his open workout at the MGM Grand hotel on Tuesday wearing a Mexican wrestling mask as traditional Latin music blasted out.\nBoxing on Mexican Independence weekend has become a big tradition in the sport dating back to when legend Julio Cesar Chavez kick fought Pernell Whitaker on the date in 1993.\nOscar De La Hoya then took over before American Floyd Mayweather Jnr gate crashed the weekend date and made it his own in the fight capital of the world as it helped boost his gate receipts and pay-per-view numbers.\nSince Mayweather\u2019s retirement, Mexican Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez has returned it to a more traditional affair but he opted out of a September 14 date at the T-Mobile this year after delays in finding an opponent.\nFury\u2019s promoters Top Rank swooped to take the venue and, although it is a British fighter facing a Swede, they\u2019re hoping to attract big crowds this weekend.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the Mexican shorts, the Mexican gloves, the Mexican mask, the Mexican music, the Mexican flag. I don\u2019t know how much more respect I can show,\u201d said Fury.\n\u201cIt is quite a list of fighters to box on this date.\n\u201cThe funny fact of it was Canelo was supposed to box on this weekend here in Vegas but for whatever reason he decided not to but I stepped up for the Mexican people.\n\u201cI brought the fight forward four weeks in order to do this. Good job I stayed fit. I am in shape and always ready.\n\u201cIt was supposed to be in New York in October but I decided to bring it forward and box on a special date.\n\"This is Fury\u2019s second fight in Las Vegas after he beat up Tom Schwarz in two rounds at the MGM Grand Garden Arena back in June.\nThere won\u2019t be anywhere near the same clamour for tickets this weekend as there would have been if Alvarez was fighting but Fury\u2019s face is still all over the famous Strip.\nPromoters Top Rank continue to try to raise his profile on this side of the Atlantic ahead of next year\u2019s rematch with WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder.\n\u201cIt is the second fight back to back and my face is as popular now as David Copperfield\u2019s is on the side of the MGM,\u201d added Fury.\nCopperfield is the world-famous magician but this week Fury will no doubt have a few tricks up his sleeve to entertain the fans.\nLol. Otto Wallin doe.\nHow many tickets have been purchased so far?<|endoftext|>Just a few miles northeast of Boerne in Kendall County lies the 117-acre plot of scenic land set aside as the Kreutzberg Canyon Natural Area (this link leads to the Kendall County Parks Department web page; click on the Kreutzberg tab on this page for more specific information). Though not as publicized or well-known as some of the Hill Country's other parks and State Natural Areas, Kreutzberg Canyon offers a wide array of things to see and do for nature enthusiasts, fossil hounds, hikers, birdwatchers, and those just looking for a peaceful and restful experience in the most picturesque region of the Lone Star State. Speaking of which, some might refer to it as \u201cKreutzberg Canyon State Park,\u201d or simply \u201cKreutzberg Canyon Park,\u201d which is fine, but officially it's a Natural Area, where the maintenance of its pristine natural condition is the main focus.\nThroughout its history, this region has served as ranch land, farming acreage, and a recreational spot for generations of Native Americans and Texans. The land was set aside for both natural preservation and public use, especially for its access to the Guadalupe River for water activity enthusiasts.\nKreutzberg Canyon's access to the Guadalupe River is arguably its most popular feature: with 1,700 feet of waterfront access available to guests here. Visitors tend to gather here more than other areas of the park, and they love to take advantage of the fishing, swimming, tubing and kayaking fun they can celebrate there. For those who aren't feeling quite so adventurous, the shores of the Guadalupe are a perfect place to pop open a deck chair and kick back. The quiet bubbling of the flowing water sets a great stage for folks to relax and decompress. Please keep in mind there are no lifeguards on duty along the river here, so all water activities are at your own risk.\nSome reviews of the area mistakenly warn their readers that there are no trails here; this is simply untrue. As a matter of fact, Kreutzberg Canyon trails cover over three linear miles, offering outstanding views of the heart of the Hill Country as visitors hike and bike. Propane grills are allowed on the grounds, so you can also step off one of the trails for a picnic, too. Pets are allowed to join you on your hike, but they must be leashed. The majority of the paths and trails here are in their natural and rugged state, so sturdy hiking boots are recommended.\nKreutzberg Canyon is also home to the Kronkosky Interpretive Garden, where plant enthusiasts can study local and adaptive plant species. Guest can learn about the region's history, and can self-educate themselves on plant identification. There are also bird observation blinds here; binoculars are recommended for spotting the various species that fly through, and the county performs a bird census at 8 AM on the third Tuesday of every month."

So I thought I would remind people once again the premise behind these rankings, how I evaluate the players, how top players are sometimes not there, how I evaluate freshmen, etc. If you already know ALL of this, then feel free to skip this paragraph and move on to the rankings.\nThese weekly college basketball rankings are designed to help people see who are the top players in each class which are seniors, juniors, sophomores and freshmen. The reason behind why I have 36 senior players is because the WNBA Draft drafts the top 36 seniors or international players. I wanted to keep it like that because basically, I wanted to see who were the top players that could eventually make a WNBA roster or superstars that could be WNBA ready early. It then decreases by 9 for each of the following classes. It\u2019s nothing special. Just basic math. I evaluate the players by taking the top colleges and some of the mid major ones as well. I look at their schedule, I look at their RPI and out of conference schedule as well. Sometimes, if a college upsets a ranked team, I take the player from the opposing team and give them a shout out for that week.\nThe basic reason why these rankings are NOT overall based is because I wanted to see week to week who were the best among their class. Those that regularly stood out, those that made a difference among their teams. Chances are, if a top player is playing well every week, they will be there. If sometimes, you don\u2019t see a top player listed, it could be one of two reasons. 1) Injured 2) Did not play well that week OR was not the reason why the team won that game that week.  I try to make these rankings fair and they take up quite a bit of time to put together.\nThis is NOT my day job. It\u2019s something I do for fun and in my spare time. For the freshmen, I rank them just a bit different from the other classes. I take the best performances from each of the freshmen regardless of school record (because it\u2019s not their fault their school hasn\u2019t played well, it\u2019s their first year) OR if a top college\u2019s freshmen played well, they will also get a spot. I have also added the (+) or (-) signs due to request so that you can track your players week to week much easier. If a player has a (NR) that just means that they were not ranked the previous week. It does NOT mean that they haven\u2019t been in the rankings in other weeks.\nAt the end of the day, I\u2019m a human and can make mistakes. I\u2019m sure I missed some top performances and I just wanted to put these rankings because I felt we were sorely missing this in women\u2019s college basketball. If you still have questions or comments to make, leave them in my comments OR on my Twitter page.\nWe are now entering into Week 4 and that means officially, college basketball has now started to see some teams separate themselves from the rest as well as certain players making"

Wiersema\u2019s sort-of memoir, Walk Like A Man. Because I know Rob in the let\u2019s-grab-a-beer kind of way, I was part of the entourage that wound up shuffling with him to some late night diner/bar combo down near The Esplanade, and there I found myself seated next to author Adrienne Kress. Kress, it turns out, is more fun than eight separate monkey barrels, and so I got her to write down the titles of her books so that I could look them up at the library. And look them up I did.\nThe obvious place for me to start was Alex and the Ironic Gentleman, as it\u2019s her first novel, and, based on the last page of the book, introduces characters that appear in her follow-up, Timothy and the Dragon\u2019s Gate. Now, I don\u2019t generally write about books for young people, not because I don\u2019t read them (though they are a long way from my primary reading material), nor because I don\u2019t enjoy them (I have enjoyed several in the last few years), but rather for the same reason I don\u2019t write about poems and books of poetry: I don\u2019t feel like I read enough of them, or understand them and the culture around them well enough, to offer anything like an informed opinion. I\u2019m making an exception for Alex and the Ironic Gentleman because a) I liked it a lot, and b) I really enjoyed meeting Adrienne Kress, I think that if you can say something good (and genuine and honest and not at all sucking-up) about the cool things someone you\u2019ve met or sort-of-know (ish?) has done, it\u2019s better to say it than not. So anyway.\nAlex and the Ironic Gentlemen is about Alexandra Morningside, who is ten-and-a-half years old and lives above her uncle\u2019s doorknob shop. The novel opens as she is entering her sixth year at the Wigpowder-Steele Academy (the names in this book are great). Alex is smart, inquisitive, and capable, and she takes immediately to her new teacher, Mr. Underwood, who apart from being a bit charismatic, really engages with his students and teaches interesting and unusual things. He\u2019s also, it so happens, heir to a pirate fortune. When Alex\u2019s uncle is killed and Mr. Underwood kidnapped by a rival pirate after Underwood\u2019s treasure, Alex embarks on a quest to rescue him, boldly diving into a world reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland (in its quasi-episodic structure, and in Kress\u2019 use of clever, off-kilter almost-archetypes), but more about growing and trying things out in a world that is both modern and anachronistic, that is full of gomi (in the Gibsonian sense, \u201cuncounted strata of message and meaning, age upon age, generated over the centuries to the dictates of some now-all-but-unreadable DNA of commerce and empire\u201d), than it is about standing firm in the face of Opium-trip fantasies as in Carroll\u2019s tales. Kress creates this world through a unique voice that blends British and North American dialects and structures in a way that\u2019s smart, clever (not the same thing!), and often belly-laugh funny.\nThere\u2019s a lot to be said about the plot, and about the consequences that come from not yet having learned the difference between attractive ideas and good ones, and about different ideas about what it means to be weak or strong (seriously, I could write a ton about the end of this book, but that would be giving things away), but mostly I\u2019m going to focus on two of the peripheral, episodic bits that I quite liked.\nFirst there\u2019s Lord Poppinjay, who runs a hotel in the middle of nowhere, and will be a figure familiar to anyone who\u2019s ever held a job, particularly one in the service industry. He\u2019s lit on the idea that his staff should perform \u201cMental Dictation\u201d (Kress is quite fond of Capitalizing Important Things, and frankly so am I), ie. they should run his hotel by reading his mind. Alex sorts all this out with a craftier version of declaring the emperor, or in"

Eighty SDL machines were selected randomly from 18 different mines. Machines working hour were monitored and recorded for all 18 mines. Full shift noise dose (TWA) was measured for the operator of each machine. Regression analysis was performed to develop the statistical model. Validity of the model was verified. The subjects are exposed to occupational noise ranging from 74 to 100.4 dBA TWA. The operator's TWA increases with increase in machine age. A fifth order polynomial equation describes the relationship between machine age and TWA. In a validation study, it was found that the predictive model works in the field on similar machines. The SDL operators are exposed to occupational noise generated, which ranges from 74 to 100.4 dBA TWA. The TWA increases with increase in the machine age. There exists a non linear relation between the SDL age and the corresponding TWA. The predictive statistical model developed in this study works satisfactorily in the field, hence the same is recommended for selected class of SDL machines deployed in Indian underground coal mines.<|endoftext|>Home TECHNOLOGY Just a month away from launching \u201cNuri\u201d\u2026\u201cHanwha Aero\u201d to be blasted...\nAs South Korea\u2019s first projectile Nuri (KSLV-\u2161) being soared into orbit is just one month away, Hanwha Aerospace(Hanwha Aero) is garnering attention. Many predict that when successfully launched, the accomplishment would become a stepping stone for growth of our space industry as Hanwha Aero is providing a total of six engines of Nuri. Experts in the financial services industry agree that whether Nuri is launched successfully next month would prove the technological prowess of engines of Hanwha Aero\u2019s projectile.\nAccording to experts in the financial services industry on the 27th, Nuri a Korean version of projectile carrying a satellite would be launched from Naro Space Center in South Jeolla\u2019s Goheung County on the 21th of next month. Its mission is to get a mock satellite as heavy as 1.5t to reach low-Earth orbit between 600 and 800km. The results of launch would determine whether Hanwha Aerospace which is focusing on the space industry secures competitiveness.\nLee Bong-Jin researcher at Hanwha Investment & Securities said, \u201cNuri development project is expected to be carries out by October of next year and engines equipped in Nuri would be continuously used in launching a low-orbit satellite. Also, as a parent company of Satrec Initiative which manufactures and supplies satellite platforms and its components and Hanwha systems which manufactures antenna system, it is expected to play a major role in Hanwha Group\u2019s space business.\nIn actuality, Hanwha Aero acquired 20% of shares of Satrec Initiative a company that specializes in satellites early this year. As a company created by researchers at KAIST Satellite Technology Research Center who developed \u201cOur Star number 1,\u201d the first satellite to be launched for South Korea that specializes in satellites, Satrec Initiative has technologies to develop and manufacture core components including the body of satellite and ground equipment.\nInsiders of the industry say that Hanwha Aero\u2019s trajectory would have a big impact on Hanwha Group\u2019s space business.\nHanwha Group is paying attention to space as a future growth engine moving fast to get ahead in the global space market which makes Hanwha Aero a de facto control tower. In March, key personnel of Hanwha Aero\u2019s space business participated in \u201cSpace Hub\u201d launched by gathering all space business projects from affiliates of Hanwha Group. Kim Dong-kwan CEO of Hanwha Solutions took the first step and assumed a leadership role of Space Hub and he is going to lead the overall space projects in Hanwha Group.\nThe Nuri project organized by Korea Aerospace Research Institute is a large-scale project which was injected two trillion won from 2010. Even after the launch of Nuri, South Korea is planning to send a space projectile mounted with domestic solid fuel engine in 2024 and major Korean businesses are expected to take part in this project.\nThe government would spare no effort in providing support for private companies following the trends of global space era. Ministry of Science and ICT is planning to support the revitalization of space-related private businesses by revising Space Development Promotion Act to foster the space industry, designating the space industry cluster to help the space-related industry, academia and institutes develop in association with one another, and transferring the rocket launch technology to the private sector. It is also planning to create a new launch pad and a launch tracking system within Naro Space Center in order to help the launch of small projectiles that are under development by private businesses.<|endoftext|>Hi everyone!

New York City? Philadelphia? Baltimore? What about the players in Buffalo, New York who have been trash-talking lately\u2026 could they be the \"King of the Tables\"? Well\u2026 Philly hosted a tri-state match between New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore. New York was unable to make the trip, so it would be a Baltimore-Philly rematch from last year. Baltimore won and Philly would be looking to avenge the loss.\nMalik Rogers would serve as host of the chess tournament and would proceed to lay out a spread of barbeque, salads and cold drinks for all. William \"the Exterminator\" Morrison quipped that Philadelphia invited pretty women to the event to distract them! He also added that said the match had an atmosphere of a cookout. Perhaps it sounded like Baltimore was being fattened up for the kill.\nJust as the script was planned, Baltimore fell behind 6-1 on the strength of Norman \"Pete\" Rogers win over Morrison and Glenn Bady's win over Oladapo Adu. Of course this can be a moral breaker for the rest of the players, but Baltimore surged back and closed the gap. However, Philly held on for a 10\u00bd-7\u00bd victory. No board results or game scores as of yet, but above photos were sent by Michael Williams.\nExterminator told The Chess Drum that there are plans to include more cities and hopefully others will want to get involved.

I have seen her offer several design options to manshin clients while presenting drawings of historic attires and musok regalia from those books as proofs to her abundant knowledge and cultural expertise. The use of academic research in material religious context blurs the boundaries between the intended academic audience and artefact producers. Academic knowledge is, in this manner, disseminated through the print industry and applied to the religious realms of musok, reducing the need of direct inspiration from gods and spirits to earn the necessary knowledge about appropriate costume preparation. Filmed rituals also avail manshin with images of various costumes that other manshin use. The commodification of musok artefacts reduced the need of personal apprenticeship for manshin and musok artefact producers, and increased reliance on knowledge mediation by factory-produced images and texts.\nDuring the first Korea Traditional Performing Arts Festival in 2007, Dr Yang introduced the ritual as an ancient practice, ignoring completely the production process of the artefacts. As a senior curator of the National Folk Museum and an avid collector of musok art, Dr Yang knew that many artefacts were mass manufactured or prepared with new synthetic materials, but he did not mind this, as long as the ceremonial words matched officially legitimized ancient texts. The contradiction between the ritual\u2019s reliance on technological innovations and its declaration as ancient was also not perceived by the manshin and her audience, who were concerned mainly with the ritual\u2019s efficacy.\nNew media has become a lively arena for musok practitioners to communicate, advertise services and learn of upcoming staged rituals. Films and other digital documentations also serve as a means for learning about musok. Interestingly, while many Korean scholars are photographed and quoted on practitioners\u2019 websites, discourse of new media usage in musok is absent from most academic publications by Korean scholars. The effort and time that is dedicated to filming and promoting the broadcasting of kut rituals on television and internet venues marks a shift of practice from word-of-mouth self-promotion and knowledge acquisition to media-mediated activities.\nFigure 16 Manshin Kim Mi-ja performing in front of cameramen at a yearly ritual on Bonghwa Mountain. Photo by Liora Sarfati.\nThe portal www.neomudang.com\ufeff\ufeff offers an interactive map where one can click on a region of Korea and find a list of manshin who practise there along with their specialties. Service providers such as musok goods stores and shrines for rent use such portals for advertising. The result of online flows of knowledge has been increased numbers of manshin who practise a hybridized style of musok, overlooking the strict regional classification that Korean scholars regard as very important.\nA common product of online musok is manshin\u2019s personal website \u2013 hompeiji \u2013 in which visitors can learn basic facts about their line of religious practice, read their biography and communicate with them. Manshin Seo Kyeong-uk hired a professional IT specialist in the mid-1990s to construct her website www.mudang.co.kr. She updates her website regularly with photos and information of upcoming performances. She also replies to readers\u2019 queries, and has included part of her introduction in English translation. She introduces herself with photos that can be interpreted as traditional dance. Those images convey elegance and grace without depicting intense ritual sequences that might be repulsive to some viewers, such as animal sacrifice or lewd humour. In other words, the website does not expose visitors to visuals that might cause uneasiness (especially people who have not been to such rituals), by limiting its scope to activities that do not contradict perspectives of modernity and progress. This is an intentional choice of the manshin in hope to diversify the clientele.\nManshin Lee Hae-gy\u01d2ng, the main protagonist of the documentary film Between, was interviewed in many newspapers, and has maintained a personal blog, www.manshin.co.kr since 2006.18 Such success in the media has often been criticized by colleagues and scholars as a sign for negligence of real healing in order to become a \u2018superstar shaman\u2019.19 However, as expected from a sincere spiritual healer, the daily practice of Manshin Lee consists mainly of treating the problems of her clients through supernatural communication.\nIn the spring of 2007, Manshin Kim Nam-sun was getting ready to commence a kut in a rented shrine near Seoul\u2019s downtown. The ritual was documented by Dr Yang. His positive impression of that performance contributed to Kim\u2019s nomination as Regional Intangible Cultural Asset Holder. Manshin Kim was excited about obtaining the title and therefore initiated a special ritual for this occasion. She proposed to her acquaintances to sponsor a kut for a minimal fee in order to allow Dr Yang to film and interrupt it freely for better documentation.\nBefore the ritual began, Manshin Kim attached a portable wireless microphone to her chest and handed a printed booklet to Dr Yang, telling him that it is a transcription by Professor Kim Tae-gon of the same ritual performed a few decades earlier by her shinomoni (spirit-mother). In Korean society, a neo-Confucian tradition of not doubting superiors results in a tendency to consider findings of previous scholars as objective truths. Well aware of this approach, Manshin Kim obtained and learned the booklet that she handed to Dr Yang. The performer and the evaluator followed the rules of the designation game. She performed a close version of the old transcription, and he in return could convincingly confirm that it is true to the \u2018original form\u2019. No mention of the technological aspects of the performance appeared in the recommendation letter.\nIn the rented shrine, Manshin Kim began to sing and turn around repeatedly when the photographer noticed that the wireless microphone faltered. Dr Yang strode to the centre of the room and touched her wrist to suggest that she stops. A bit surprised, she stood still and allowed the two men to arrange the microphone again and test it before resuming her possession-trance dance. In an ordinary kut, a performer would not pause while becoming entranced, but in this new context, she was attentive to the scholars\u2019 needs. Furthermore, her ability to control herself during possession signified high level of professional skills and strengthened her plea to be nominated Ritual Holder. The assistants were clearly annoyed at the interference, but nobody protested. They all understood the implications of the event on their professional futures and accepted the need of technology-aided documentation. In stepping into the ritual arena, Dr Yang became an integral part of the performance. The evaluator who used electronic recording intervened in the ritual process and determined its pace.\nThe need to choose preservation nominees among more than a hundred thousand practising manshin produced a complex designation process. A number of Korean folklore scholars, such as Dr Yang, are hired to evaluate various kut, and their conclusions are handed to a special committee to decide which rituals are the most valuable.21 When people become clients of manshin, they search for ritual efficacy, its power to heal them or solve their personal problems. When folklore scholars look for kut to designate, they search for well-established practitioners whose work has already been appreciated by many clients. Within the relevant candidates, scholars then evaluate rituals by measuring their affinity with what is deemed to be the ritual\u2019s original form.\nEvaluating contemporary rituals through comparison with historic kut is problematic for various reasons. A lack of filming devices in the past produced mainly transcriptions of ritual songs with little attention to other performative aspects. The transmission of tradition is perceived in this comparison as an intergenerational imitation with no notice of manshin\u2019s agency and creativity in adapting text to context and altering ritual form and meaning according to their personal preferences. Events that precede and follow the actual ritual, such as altar construction, have not been studied. Cultural performances are sponsored through the Cultural Heritage Protection Act only if they are proven to be \u2018carrying great historic, artistic or academic values\u2019.25 This statement demonstrates how the evaluation criteria are based on analytic categories formulated by scholars, and not by performers and patrons who would emphasize the efficacy which is based on religious belief.\nDesignating kut as Important Intangible Cultural Heritage encapsulates a paradox because the wish to petrify rituals in order to connect the present with pre-modern Korean culture requires detaching the performance from its religious intention. Tradition is ever-changing, as shown in various case studies.26 The Korean culture preservation policy seeks to establish a coherent corpus of officially recognized performances as a canonical representation of \u2018the Korean Spirit\u2019. Most preserved kut are a living tradition in the performers\u2019 repertoire. However, contemporary kut are not always comparable to the ones archived by a previous scholar. Officially scripted rituals often prevent manshin from adapting the performance to specific needs of clients and are therefore performed for a general cause such as \u2018blessing the audience\u2019 or \u2018the wellbeing of the nation\u2019. These kut are not perceived as fake or secular re-performances because blessing the audience and the nation is regarded a worthy purpose. As they follow the ritual\u2019s script, manshin feel comfortable to use various technologies such as sound amplification, lighting and impressive, commercially manufactured offerings to ensure the ritual\u2019s success that is measured in this case not by its efficacy but by achieving audience solidarity and enjoyment.\nThe \u2018original forms\u2019 sought by Korean scholars are established on a shaky basis even in their own terms because the presumed originality of the earlier event to which they compare contemporary kut cannot be determined using the same standards. The documented performance eventually lacks a comparable antecedent. The scholars are let with the undisputable judgement of an earlier scholar as the sole originality determinant. The documentation process of an earlier scholar can be imagined as a quite arduous task as he writes down full transcription of ritual texts and a bit about the ritual\u2019s sequence and segments. The scholar becomes a mediator between"

The Town Hybrid RT model combines the easy-to-use ethos of all our Town Hybrid bikes with the extra safety of an additional back pedal brake - for riders who appreciate an alternative to the usual braking options - and an upgrade to an 8 speed, low maintenance hub gear. With included mudguards, kickstand, luggage carrier and lights, you've everything you need to get you around in all weathers and at any time of day. The result? A great combo for environmentally friendly urban mobility - for work, for family and for pleasure.\nFor 2018 we re-thought every aspect of our easy entry Town Hybrid frame. Beginning with the step-through design, we made it easier than ever to use and added a protection sticker at the lowest point to help protect the paintwork from wear and tear. The Bosch drive unit is mounted in an ultra-strong, gravity cast housing and we moved the battery to a position behind the rigid, triple chamber seat tube for easy access and a safer ride. Cables for gears and brakes are routed inside the frame for reduced maintenance, and the clean looks are emphasised with our Smooth Welding process so that the frame tubes flow seamlessly from one to the next.

Typical symptoms comprise necrotic spots on leaves, canker and dieback on canes and trunks, twig wilting, and blossom necrosis. Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa), which is the causal agent of kiwifruit bacterial canker, is divided into four biovars based on multilocus sequence analysis of different genes, additional PCR testing of pathogenic genes (argKtox cluster, cfl, and various effector genes), and biochemical and physiological characterization. Bacterial canker caused by Psa biovar 2 designated Psa2 was detected for the first time on the green-fleshed kiwifruit cultivar Hayward in 1988 and the yellow-fleshed kiwifruit cultivar Hort16A in 2006 in Korea. Psa biovar 3 designated Psa3, responsible for the current global pandemics of kiwifruit bacterial canker, began to appear in Korea in 2011 and caused tremendous economic losses by destroying many vines or orchards of yellow-fleshed kiwifruit cultivars in one or several growing seasons. Bacterial canker epidemics caused by both Psa2 and Psa3 are prevalent in Korea in recent years. In this review, we summarize the symptomatology, etiology, disease cycle, diagnosis, and epidemiology of kiwifruit bacterial canker in Korea.\n\n\nIntroduction\nKiwifruit is native to China and surrounding Asian countries. There are more than 70 individual species within the Actinidia genus, and most of them grow as rampant vines in forests (Ferguson, 2010). Among commercially cultivated Actinidia species, A. deliciosa and A. chinensis are major species. The most popular cultivars Hayward and Hort16A, which were bred in New Zealand, belong to A. deliciosa and A. chinensis, respectively. The green-fleshed kiwifruit cultivar Hayward was introduced into Korea in 1970s while the yellow-fleshed kiwifruit cultivar Hort16A has been cultivated on Jeju Island since 2004. Several yellow-fleshed kiwifruit cultivars such as Haegeum, Jecygold, and Halla-gold were bred in Korea, and other cultivars were imported from China and New Zealand.\nThe cultivation and production of kiwifruit are rapidly skyrocketing due to the strong market demand of consumers in recent years (Fig. 1). The cultivation acreage for kiwifruit in 2015 reached up to approximately 1,300 ha, comprising 45%, 31%, and 24% located in Jeonnam, Gyeongnam, and Jeju provinces, respectively. Major cultivation regions with their acreages are shown in Fig. 2. Green-fleshed kiwifruit cultivars occupy 65% of the acreage, followed by 33% for yellow-fleshed kiwifruit cultivars and 2% for red-fleshed kiwifruit cultivars.\nBacterial canker is the largest limiting factor in the cultivation and production of kiwifruit. Kiwifruit bacterial canker was detected for the first time in 1984 on a greenfleshed kiwifruit cultivar Hayward in Japan Takikawa et al., 1989), and the disease also occurred in Korea (Koh and Lee, 1992;Koh et al., 1994) and China (Wang et al., 1992). Many orchards in Japan and Korea were completely destroyed by bacterial canker epidemics during that time, resulting in huge economic losses to Hayward growers. Around the same time, the disease also occurred in Italy (Scortichini, 1994) but did not have as severe an impact as in Japan and Korea. For this reason, bacterial canker had not received worldwide attention until massive outbreaks on the yellow-fleshed kiwifruit cultivar Hort16A in major kiwifruit-growing countries.\nBacterial canker on the yellow-fleshed kiwifruit cultivar Hort16A occurred for the first time in Korea (Koh et al., 2010) in 2006, followed by Italy (Balestra et al., 2009(Balestra et al., ) in 2008. The disease has been reported in Portugal (Balestra et al., 2010), Spain (Abelleira et al., 2011), France (Vanneste et al., 2011b, and Turkey (Bastas and Karakaya, 2012) in Europe as well as New Zealand (Everett et al., 2011) and Chile (EPPO, 2011) on other continents. Currently, bacterial canker has spread to a pandemic scale worldwide and causes tremendous economic losses by destroying kiwifruit vines or orchards in one or several growing seasons.\n\nEtiology\nPseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) is the causal agent of bacterial canker of kiwifruit. This pathogen, belonging to the Family Pseudomonadaceae and Order Pseudomonadales, was first described in Japan in 1989 by Takikawa et al. (1989). It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, motile, and rod-shaped bacterium with polar flagella, oxidase-negative, arginine dihydrolase-negative, opaque, pale-yellowish, and formed circular colonies on peptone sucrose agar media (Fig. 3).\nHigh-throughput sequences have led to deep genome analysis based on molecular markers such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) of different genes such as housekeeping, type III effectors, and phytotoxins. This has allowed a phylogenetic tree to be drawn based on the alignment on many core genome protein sequences as well as an understanding of the phylogenetic connections between different Psa isolates worldwide (Donati et al., 2014). Based on these analyses, global Psa populations were mainly divided into three lineages (biovars 1, 2, and 3) designated Psa1, Psa2, and Psa3, respectively (Chapman et al., 2012).\nThe first lineage Psa1, isolated in Japan in 1984  and Italy in 1992 (Scortichini, 1994), possesses the chromosomal phaseolotoxin gene cluster acquired by horizontal gene transfer (Sawada et al., 1997(Sawada et al.,, 1999(Sawada et al.,, 2002. The second lineage Psa2, distributed only in Korea, possesses the coronatine gene cluster instead of the phaseolotoxin gene cluster as phytotoxins (Han et al., 2003). The third lineage Psa3, responsible for the current bacterial canker pandemics worldwide, is characterized by the lack of genes expressing either phaseolotoxin or coronatine and possesses four putative hop genes encoding effector proteins.\nPsa3, responsible for the current bacterial canker pandemics worldwide, began to appear from central Italy since 2008 (Ferrante and Scortichini, 2009). This pathogen has rapidly spread to other kiwifruit-producing regions in Italy and has been reported in other European countries. On other continents, it has also been detected in New Zealand (Everett et al., 2011) and Chile (EPPO, 2011). A coordinated study on core genome SNPs and integrative conjugative elements (ICEs), combined with disease history, led to the hypothesis that the European, New Zealand, Chilean, and Korean strains of Psa3 are of Chinese origin (Butler et al., 2013(Butler et al.,, 2015Marcelletti et al., 2011;McCann et al., 2013).  In Korea, the first bacterial canker by Psa2 was observed on Hayward in 1988 (Koh and Lee, 1992) and Hort16A in 2006 (Koh et al., 2010) on Jeju Island. Psa3 was first detected in 2011 on the yellow-fleshed kiwifruit cultivar Yellow-king and red-fleshed kiwifruit cultivar Hongyang in Goheung, Jeonnam province (Koh et al., 2012). Since then, frequent Psa3 incidences have occurred on yellow-and red-fleshed kiwifruit cultivars in major kiwifruit growing areas in Korea. Annual monitoring of Psa population enables estimation of various genetic"

These include various kinds of ideas and plans that help in weight loss along with improving the overall health and fitness of the body. Basically for weight loss, different people apply different kinds of strategies. There are two kinds of people here which are ones with high metabolic rates and those with poor metabolic rates. It should be remembered that metabolic rates change with time.\nThere are some people with naturally high metabolic rates and hence they never really have to bother with losing weight but this is not a permanent feature and the metabolic rate of the body changes with time. Hence even if they are staying thin in spite of the calorie laden junk food, they might not be so lucky in the future. The reasons for rapid weight loss can be an immediate engagement or wedding or any other social function also.\nHence it is best to implement ways to improve the metabolic rate of the body for improving weight loss chances. However this option becomes more restricted with sedate work stations and the calorie laden foods consumed today. A successful weight loss program can be attained only if the users combine dieting with exercises because this way the rate of metabolism in the body can be improved and thus eating frequent meals is also suggested.\nThrough various researches and studies it has been proved that eating frequent meals helps the metabolic rate of the body to increase. The increase, or improvement, in the metabolic rate results in faster burning of food that further enhances conversion of food to energy. But it should always be kept in mind that frequent meals should not be junk food or else you may put on more weight instead of losing weight.\nBalancing your meals and exercising are the best ways for rapid weight loss and while doing the same it should be remembered that the calories burnt by the body are less than what the body consumes. A simple example here is of you consume about 2500 to 3000 calories per day but are losing only 2000 through exercising, then you have about 1000 calories which are getting deposited as fat in your body. But if you are reducing the number of calories to less than 2000, through healthier food options, then you can lose weight faster and stay thin.\nAgain the food which you are consuming should be less in fat and the carbohydrate content because they have more calories, as compared to the foods. Try and have more foods that contain protein and vitamin sources. But this routine should be followed with dedication and regularity because this will enhance the process of weight loss. Exercising should be done at least 5 days a week for about 40 minutes to an hour for maximum impact and you should try and eat within 30 minutes of the workout. This helps in faster digestion of food and conversions to energy.<|endoftext|>Four Hits for Fred Lewis, Jays Beat Padres.\nShare All sharing options for: Four Hits for Fred Lewis, Jays Beat Padres.\nNow that was fun to watch. A bunch of Jays had good days at the plate. Fred Lewis started us off with a triple, then had 3 more hits. He was home run short of the cycle. He did have a shot at it, with the bases loaded in the 9th but he 'just' singled, driving in 2 runs. A great day, triple, double, 2 singles, 2 runs, 2 RBI and a stolen base.\nJohn Buck was 2 for 4, with a home run and 2 RBI. Lyle Overbay was 2 for 2 with 2 walks. Vernon Wells was just 1 for 4, but the 1 was his 16th home run. The only 0 fors were Adam Lind and Edwin Encarnacion. Oh and Ricky Romero was 0 for 2 with 2 strikeouts, slacker.\nRomero pitched 6 good innings, the only run to score against him came on his own error, trying to get an out at first on a ball he should have never thrown. He gave up 5 innings, 3 walks while striking out 5. He did go to a lot of full counts so he came out after 6 innings with 108 pitches. Scott Downs pitched a scoreless inning and Shawn Camp had two of them. I didn't understand why Cito sent Camp out for the second inning, with us up by 6, an off day tomorrow and no a few pitchers that could have used some work.\nJays of the Day are Buck (.185 WPA), Lewis (.145) and Romero (.142). Lyle deserves an honorable mention for the 2 for 2, 2 walks and some good defense.\nFor those that think winning is all that is needed to get fans to the park, the Padres are tied for first in the NL West and still just had 16,000 at the game today.\nSome Jay's news. John McDonald has been activated off the Bereavement List. Jeremy Reed has been sent to Vegas. Also Brian Dopirak was outrighted to Vegas. That means he was removed from the 40-man roster and that he cleared waivers. So if you had any thoughts of Dopirak being called up to the Jays, it doesn't look like it will happen. Now the Jays haven't said why they wanted the open spot on the 40-man, but you'd almost think that they wanted to make room for someone. Or they are just keeping their options open.\nAnd Yorbit Torrealba for 3 games for going nuts over a strike 3 call the other day.\nThe Jays have an off day tomorrow, so Hugo or really Mrs. Hugo, there is a good window to have your little one. The Jays are heading home to host the Giants for three games. After that the Cardinals are in town and I will be too. I'll be at those three games. If people want to get together, I thought we'd go to C'est What? after the Tuesday game. So if you would like to stop by for a couple of beer that would be great. Unless someone has a better plan.<|endoftext|>Thank you and your company very much for kind, honest and fast service.\nThe car is exactly as same as you described..

        "passage": "ck.\u201d In a subsequent article, I said that the appearance of Dr. Arnold Relman as a patient at Massachusetts General Hospital, accompanied by his wife, Dr. Marcia Angell, was like the appearance of a royal couple: two former editors of the major journal, New England Journal of Medicine, physicians of the highest reputation and visibility, and senior mentor of many of the doctors on staff. (I have long admired Relman and Angell\u2019s critical writings about the medical profession, and have read NEJM for many years in order to say in touch with medicine and the state of the profession.) After the ER, Relman moved to the Mass General Intensive Care Unit. There, the ninety-year old Relman died three times, only to be brought back to life by the vigorous efforts of the doctors. I noted that he had around him as supportive personal visitors during and after official visiting hours large numbers of doctors and lawyers, many of them relatives of Relman and/or Angell. It seemed clear to me that this distinguished liberal couple had put together (Angell used her editorial skills) a magnificent account of a benign and successful hospitalization, but an account which did not even come close to considering the haloing effect of professional courtesy for an eminent figure reduced to patienthood. I felt that this failure reflected a blind spot in the profession\u2019s understanding of unequal access to medical care and that the lack of awareness of his own life-saving privilege tainted Relman\u2019s larger analysis of the US medical system.\nI sent my critique as a letter to the editor of The New York Review of Books, and heard nothing further. I published it on the New Politics Blog (January 22) as \u201cHow a Famous Ninety-Year Old Doctor Survived Hospitalization, But You Probably Won\u2019t,\u201d and then on Truthout (February 2). Now, some three months later, the May 8, 2014 New York Review carries a respectful letter from Dr. Manuel Martinez-Maldonado, who offers courteous praise for Relman\u2019s article. But then, Martinez-Maldonado notes: Relman \u201cprovides a list of factors that he feels allowed him to remain alive, He forgets a very important one\u2026 One does not rapidly forget the editor of The New England Journal of Medicine. I\u2019m sure that helped a lot with his care. I wonder \u2026 what would have been the experience of John Doe.\u201d Having allowed himself this remark, Dr. Martinez-Maldonado then returns to his attitude of deference.\nRelman then responds to Martinez-Maldonado, stating that his individual identity made no difference in the Emergency Room. But, he now acknowledges, the ICU was a different matter. The staff \u201callowed members of my family (particularly the physicians in my family) to stay at my bedside after visiting hours. I don\u2019t think this would have been the case if I had been \u2018John Doe,\u2019 and I am quite convinced that this special treatment furthered my recovery.\nWe have to be grateful for small things. But Relman\u2019s belated and very partial concession avoids confrontation with the role of privilege in access to life-saving medical care. Privilege is often invisible to those who have it. In fact a profession that claims to be above such things is riddled with systemic tribalisms which decide, often on a social basis, who lives and who dies. We sorely lack a critique of this from within the profession, and from patients, who must rise above the feudal deference built into the practice of medicine.\nWhen doctors hear about, or experience, the horrors of contemporary medical care, they tend to miss the systemic quality and explain it with the medical equivalent of, \u201cthere\u2019s a bad apple in every barrel\u201d\u2014an argument whose absurdity they may see when applied to police beatings of black youth, but whose absurdity they miss when applying it to medical care.

Diseases caused by Fusarium spp. can affect the yield and grain quality of maize because of contamination with numerous mycotoxins produced by these fungi. The present study was performed to identify the prevailing Fusarium species and the environmental factors affecting their frequencies and the contamination of grain with the main mycotoxins deoxynivalenol (DON, zearalenone (ZON and fumonisin B1 (FB1. Thirty kernel samples were collected in three locations in 2011 and in seven locations in 2012 from three hybrids. On average, 25.24% kernels were colonized by Fusarium spp. (424 strains were isolated. Fusarium verticillioides and F. temperatum were the most prevalent species, F. subglutinans, F. proliferatum and F. graminearum were in minor abundance. In total, 272 isolates of F. verticillioides and 81 isolates of F. temperatum were identified. Fusarium temperatum frequency ranged from 1.70% to 28.57% and differences between locations were significant. Fumonisin B1 was found in all tested samples. DON was found in 66.67% and ZON in 43.33% of samples. Rainfall amount positively affected F. temperatum and F. subglutinans frequency in opposite to mean temperatures in July. On the other hand, relationships between frequency of these species and historical data from 1950-2000 for annual temperature range were negative in contrast to the coldest quarter temperatures.\nFull Text Available Adlay seed samples were collected from three adlay growing regions (Yeoncheon, Hwasun, and Eumseong region in Korea during 2012. Among all the samples collected, 400 seeds were tested for fungal occurrence by standard blotter and test tube agar methods and different taxonomic groups of fungal genera were detected. The most predominant fungal genera encountered were Fusarium, Phoma, Alternaria, Cladosporium, Curvularia, Cochliobolus and Leptosphaerulina. Fusarium species accounted for 45.6% of all species found; and, with phylogenetic analysis based on the combined sequences of two protein coding genes (EF-1\u00ce\u00b1 and \u00ce\u00b2-tubulin, 10 Fusarium species were characterized namely, F. incarnatum (11.67%, F. kyushuense (10.33%, F. fujikuroi (8.67%, F. concentricum (6.00%, F. asiaticum (5.67%, F. graminearum (1.67%, F. miscanthi (0.67%, F. polyphialidicum (0.33%, F. armeniacum (0.33%, and F. thapsinum (0.33%. The Fusarium species were then examined for their morphological characteristics to confirm their identity. Morphological observations of the species correlated well with and confirmed their molecular identification. The ability of these isolates to produce the mycotoxins fumonisin (FUM and zearalenone (ZEN was tested by the ELISA quantitative analysis method. The result revealed that FUM was produced only by F. fujikuroi and that ZEN was produced by F. asiaticum and F. graminearum.\nAnalysis of Quality-Related Parameters in Mature Kernels of Polygalacturonase Inhibiting Protein (PGIP) Transgenic Bread Wheat Infected with Fusarium graminearum.\nFusarium head blight, caused by the fungus Fusarium graminearum, has a detrimental effect on both productivity and qualitative properties of wheat. To evaluate its impact on wheat flour, we compared its effect on quality-related parameters between a transgenic bread wheat line expressing a bean polygalacturonase inhibiting protein (PGIP) and its control line. We have compared metabolic proteins, the amounts of gluten proteins and their relative ratios, starch content, yield, extent of pathogen contamination, and deoxynivalenol (DON) accumulation. These comparisons showed that Fusarium significantly decreases the amount of starch in infected control plants, but not in infected PGIP plants. The flour of PGIP plants contained also a lower amount of pathogen biomass and DON accumulation. Conversely, both gluten and metabolic proteins were not significantly influenced either by the transgene or by fungal infection. These results indicate that the transgenic PGIP expression reduces the level of infection, without changing significantly the wheat seed proteome and other quality-related parameters.\nTranscriptome dynamics of a susceptible wheat upon Fusarium head blight reveals that molecular responses to Fusarium graminearum infection fit over the grain development processes.\nIn many plant/pathogen interactions, host susceptibility factors are key determinants of disease development promoting pathogen growth and spreading in plant tissues. In the Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease, the molecular basis of wheat susceptibility is still poorly understood while it could provide new insights into the understanding of the wheat/Fusarium graminearum (Fg) interaction and guide future breeding programs to produce cultivars with sustainable resistance. To identify the wheat grain candidate genes, a genome-wide gene expression profiling was performed in the French susceptible wheat cultivar, Recital. Gene-specific two-way ANOVA of about 40\u00c2 K transcripts at five grain developmental stages identified 1309 differentially expressed genes. Out of these, 536 were impacted by the Fg effect alone. Most of these Fg-responsive genes belonged to biological and molecular functions related to biotic and abiotic stresses indicating the activation of common stress pathways during susceptibility response of wheat grain to FHB. This analysis revealed also 773 other genes displaying either specific Fg-responsive profiles along with grain development stages or synergistic adjustments with the grain development effect. These genes were involved in various molecular pathways including primary metabolism, cell death, and gene expression reprogramming. An increasingly complex host response was revealed, as was the impact of both Fg infection and grain ontogeny on the transcription of wheat genes. This analysis provides a wealth of candidate genes and pathways involved in susceptibility responses to FHB and depicts new clues to the understanding of the susceptibility determinism in plant/pathogen interactions.\nOverexpression of wheat lipid transfer protein gene TaLTP5 increases resistances to Cochliobolus sativus and Fusarium graminearum in transgenic wheat.\nThe fungus Cochliobolus sativus is the main pathogen of common root rot, a serious soil-borne disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The fungus Fusarium graminearum is the primary pathogen of Fusarium head blight, a devastating disease of wheat worldwide. In this study, the wheat lipid transfer protein gene, TaLTP5, was cloned and evaluated for its ability to suppress disease development in transgenic wheat. TaLTP5 expression was induced after C. sativus infection. The TaLTP5 expression vector, pA25-TaLTP5, was constructed and bombarded into Chinese wheat variety Yangmai 18. Six TaLTP5 transgenic wheat lines were established and characterized. PCR and Southern blot analyses indicated that the introduced TaLTP5 gene was integrated into the genomes of six transgenic wheat lines by distinct patterns, and heritable. RT-PCR and real-time quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the TaLTP5 gene was over-expressed in the transgenic wheat lines compared to segregants lacking the transgene and wild-type wheat plants. Following challenge with C. sativus or F. graminearum, all six transgenic lines overexpressing TaLTP5 exhibited significantly enhanced resistance to both common root rot and Fusarium head blight compared to the untransformed wheat Yangmai 18.\nLytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are important for the enzymatic conversion of biomass and seem to play a key role in degradation of the plant cell wall. In this study, we characterize an LPMO from the fungal plant pathogen Fusarium graminearum (FgLPMO9A) that catalyzes the mixed C1/C4...... that when incubated with a mixture of xyloglucan and cellulose, FgLPMO9A efficiently attacks the xyloglucan, whereas cellulose conversion is inhibited. This suggests that removal of hemicellulose may be the true function of this LPMO during biomass conversion....\nPat\u00c3\u00b3genos em sementes de milho (Zea mays) causam s\u00c3\u00a9rios problemas, como a perda de sua capacidade germinativa.

While the expansion of exports has a positive impact on income, the changes in the structures of factor market have a large negative impact on all ethnic groups.\nThere are two causes that may explain the negative impact of factor market. First, import substitution effects are driven by offshoring activities (outsourcings). These activities rely heavily on imported inputs, which substitute domestic value-added exports.\nSecond, skill-biased technological change effects. Due to skill-biased technological change, the changes in the structure of factor inputs led to large decreases in the labour incomes for all unskilled workers to modest decreases for skilled workers. Export growth led to large income increases for unskilled workers and modest increases for skilled workers. The combination of these two forces had a positive effect on the incomes of skilled workers but a negative effect for the unskilled workers.\nFor the three major ethnic groups, the export growth and changes in the structure of factor market had relatively small percentage effects on income growth of the Malays when compared with the Indians and the Chinese.\nThe underlying reason is that a large percentage of the Malays are employed in the public sector, with its focus on the domestic market and is thus rather insensitive to changes in export demand. This was a clear result of the policy to restructure the society through an expansion of the public services sectors where priority had been given to skilled Malay workers and through the promotion of exports of labour-intensive products (which rely on unskilled workers).\nAll unskilled workers benefited greatly from export growth but suffered more from the changes in the structure of factor market. The Chinese and Indian skilled workers suffered slightly from the changes in structure of factor market but benefited more from export growth. The Malay skilled workers benefited slightly from both types of changes.\nAltogether, the policy reforms through expansion of the public services sector and export promotion for the private sector, have had limited effect in terms of reducing income inequality across ethnic groups.<|endoftext|>Meet new friends and get a great aerobic workout!

I won\u2019t go into too much detail but suffice it to say that we are glad we are past this day, with Koryn well on her way to winning her battle.\nKoryn started the day in Nuclear Medicine with the injection of the radioactive dye for her Lymph node biopsy, which was done during her four hours of surgery. Needless to say, Koryn was understandably anxious throughout the morning, and while her time in Anesthesia was, in itself stressful, she left anesthesia definitely in her \u201chappy place\u201d. The surgery took a total of 4 hours, and according to both of her surgeons\u2026it was a success. There were really no complications or unexpected findings. We won\u2019t know the final results of the lymph node biopsy for about a week. Lymph node involvement is a major factor in determining Koryn\u2019s final treatment plan, so we anxiously, yet prayerfully look forward to those results.\nKoryn finally emerged from recovery, or shall I say, reached some level of lucidity about 530 this evening. They have been giving her a pretty hefty dose of painkillers, so she was feeling pretty good when I left her at 9. Her pain was pretty much under control, although the next 12 hours will probably be a little rough as the spinal block they gave her will slowly wear off and the full pain load will be on the meds they are giving her"

But when I click in \"Repositories\" under a project I could see the error \"The entry or revision was not found in the repository\".\nCan any one help me in this issue?\nFelix, as far as I can understand, the problem I had was with the CVS server and client which doesn't have the 'rls' support. \"rls\" is for listing files and directories in the topmost directory of a repository.\nUnfortunately, the version comes with Fedora 13 (the latest) is CVS 1.11.23 which does not have the rls support. CVS version 1.12.X seems to be supporting rls so it resolves the issue for me.\nYes, I understood that. The question was wether this was a fedora specific problem, a problem that will arise more often because 'rls' is or will be deprecated, and so on.\nIf it's Fedora specific, I'd almost say no. If it's inherent to CVS independently of what distribution it comes from: yes, and I'd ask you to file a bug.\nI think we need to alter the cvs adapter as we can't expect all CVS servers have the rls support.<|endoftext|>Black rubber cord for pendants is strong and stylish \u2013 a perfect substitute for real leather (in our opinion, it\u2019s even better).\nProduction time would take up to three weeks, if these cords are not available in store at the moment.\nBlack Rubber Cord.<|endoftext|><iframe height='600' scrolling='no' title='Github trending plus by zircle' src='//github-trending-plus.surge.sh' frameborder='1' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>\n</iframe>\n\n::: tip\nThis is an experimental example and is currently being developed.

Our results show that there has been a negative impacts on sea mustard yields as seawater surface temperature continuously has been rising. Especially if the upward trend in seawater surface temperature since 2005 will be maintained in future, sea mustard yield is expected to decrease by 2.6% per year.\nThe removal characteristics of As and Se ions from aqueous solution by hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (HTMAB) modified anthracite (HTMAB-AT) were investigated under various conditions of contact time, pH and temperature. When the pH is 6, the zeta potential value of anthracite (AT) is -24 mV and on the other hand, the zeta potential value of the HTMAB-AT is +44 mV. It can be seen that the overall increase of about 60 mV. Increasing the (+) potential value indicates that the surface of the adsorbent had a stronger positive charge, so adsorption for the anion metal was increased. The isotherm data was well described by Langmuir and Temkin isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 7.81 and 6.89 mg/g for As and Se ions from the Langmuir isotherm model at 298 K, respectively. The kinetic data was tested using pseudo first and pseudo second order models. The results indicated that adsorption fitted well with the pseudo second order kinetic model. The mechanism of the adsorption process showed that adsorption was dependent on intra particle diffusion model according to two step diffusion. The thermodynamic parameters(${\\Delta}G^{\\circ}$, ${\\Delta}H^{\\circ}$, and ${\\Delta}S^{\\circ}$) were also determined using the equilibrium constant value obtained at different temperatures. The thermodynamic parameters indicated that the adsorption process was physisorption, and also an endothermic and spontaneous process.\nNitrogen budgets in Sihwa-ho in 2010 were estimated using a mass balance approach. Major nitrogen fluxes sources can be divided into three sections: cities, agricultural area, and forest. Surplus nitrogen 2,030~2,214 ton/yr (2,123 ton/yr in average) was discharged to Sihwa Lake. 20% of the surplus nitrogen is removed from the wetland and 60% is removed tidal flats. Therefore net nitrogen discharge from Sihwa basin is estimated to be 650~708 ton/yr (679 ton/yr in average). Wet and dry nitrogen deposition and load from non-point sources ware estimated to be 97 ton/yr and 69 ton/yr, deposition is using CAMx model. So estimated total nitrogen discharge into Sihwa-ho was 817~875 ton/yr (846 ton/yr in average). The atmospheric load explains 11.1~11.9% (11.5% in average) of the total nitrogen load Sihwa-ho.\nThe present study was carried out to investigate the effects of spermine treatment on the growth, yield and quality in strawberry under low-temperature condition, and thereby develop a chemical method to minimize damages by low temperature in greenhouse cultivation. Spermine treatment significantly improved the growth of strawberry in terms of leaf number, leaf area, leaf length, leaf diameter, plant height and plant weight. The highest effect was observed in the 250 uM spermine treatment and the effect tended to be maintained during the entire growth period of 90 days. Fresh weight and dry weight were significantly different depending on the concentrations of spermine. Strawberry plants treated with 250 uM spermine showed higher fresh weight and dry weight compared to untreated control plants during the growth period. Fruit weight, fruit length and fruit diameter were relatively higher when treated with $100{\\mu}M$ spermine compared to other treatments. The fruit yield was the highest with 14 fruits per plant at $250{\\mu}M$ spermine treatment and the coloration of the fruit was the best at this treatment with the Hunter a and b values of 46.56 and 28.75, respectively. The hardness of strawberry fruit tended to increase higher than 2N at $250{\\mu}M$ and $500{\\mu}M$ 250 uM spermine treatment. The sugar content of strawberries treated with $250{\\mu}M$ spermine was $9.5^{\\circ}$ Bx which was $1.6^{\\circ}$ Bx higher compared to that in untreated control. However, spermine treatment did not affect the acidity of fruit and it remained 0.68-0.76% regardless of treatment concentrations. These results suggest that spermine treatment has a positive effect on the growth and productivity of strawberry fruit under abnormal low-temperature condition. The positive effect was the highest at $250{\\mu}M$ spermine treatment and gradually decreased in the order of $100{\\mu}M$, $500{\\mu}M$, and untreated control.\nFor this study, WRF numerical modeling was performed, using RDAPS information for input data on typhoons affecting the Korean peninsula to produce wind data of"

Diving into the reviews is usually a decent way to gauge an item's quality, but you're at the mercy of the people who leave the reviews.\nIn a sea of five-star ratings with no comments and one-star ratings complaining about an entirely different product, one woman's post stands out. Her review is so legendary that it may forever change how you test your Amazon purchases.\nEverything started on a fateful day in July when an Amazon user named Cory H. ordered a pair of Raypose leggings on the digital marketplace. While it may be pretty standard to leave a review if you enjoy a product, Cory's story went a bit differently. After receiving her new leggings, Cory decided to go on a hike, which truly tested the leggings' limits.\n\"Here is me rolling and sliding down a mountain because I was too scared to get up. My leggings did not rip not even a little bit and I got stuck on rocks and trees,\" read Cory's review. She also included two photos as proof, which showed Cory sliding down a cliff face in a less-than-graceful manner. This clearly showed off the indestructibility of the leggings, but we can't help but wonder\u2026 who took the photos?\nIt didn't take long for Cory's incredible review to spread across the internet, becoming an instant viral hit. To this day, over a year later, people are still discovering and sharing Cory's review. The review itself has over 18,000 commendations, while the oldest tweets sharing her misfortune have racked up over 400,000 likes and 26,000 retweets.\nOf course, social media users around the world fell in love with Cory. After all, who wouldn't love the sheer confidence it takes to post something like this? Comments like, \"I want to be her bestie,\" and, \"Can I please hang out with this person\" poured in, as well as thousands of people trying to locate the mountain-proof tights.\nAlong with those who adored Cory's vibe were people who saw themselves in her. Many Twitter users commented on how relatable Cory's hiking style was.\nOne tweeted, \"As a person who scoots down rocks when I hike, I would very much like to know what brand this is.\"\nAnd another posted, \"Ok but which leggings are these please because that is 100% how I hike\"\nIf you take a look on the Amazon page for the Raypose leggings, you'll see that other reviewers have gotten in on the fun. \"Mountain sliding legging lady was right,\" said one user, who added a photo of herself laying down on a slight slope, mimicking Cory's pose.\nOther customers gave shoutouts to Cory's original review, as well.\nAmazon user Megan Slaten posted, \"I ordered these after the review from the lady that slid down the mountain [laughing] I'm not going to attempt to follow her descent (I would break something) but she was right! These leggings are great!!!\"\nAnother stated, \"Ok so I bought these based on the viral review of the woman falling down the hill. As someone that's clumsy and loves comfort, I felt that review deep down in my soul!\"\nAnd a third added, \"I legitimately cannot think of a better way to advertise or review this. How do you get a more rigorous field test than this.\"\nAs it turns out, these leggings aren't just great for sliding down mountains, as one user attested: \"I decided to buy these pants because of the viral review. If they were good for sliding down a mountain, they must be good for aerials!\"\nAs if the reviews weren't enough, the questions and answers section is full of hilarity. One user asked, \"How well do these handle rolling down a mountainside?\" only to receive answers like, \"Absolutely. They don't call it space-dyed for nothing! (Tested in space presumably? )I would however suggest a helmet...for the trees and stuff. Safety first!\"\nHonestly, the fact that Raypose hasn't included \"mountain-resistant\" to the feature list of the leggings is a massive missed opportunity. As one Twitter user posted, \"I really hope the company gave her free leggings for life for that kind of solid endorsement. Bc how can you not be sold when you read that.\"\nIf Cory's harrowing hike and endearing testimony weren't enough to convince you to pick up a pair of these leggings, nothing could. As far as we're concerned, if leggings can't survive some hill-scooting, we're not interested.<|endoftext|>The Jeokmyeol-bogung (Silent Nirvana Treasure Palace) at Beopheungsa Temple in Yeongwol, Gangwon-do.\nBeopheungsa Temple, which means \u201cDharma Promotion Temple,\u201d in English, is located in Yeongwol, Gangwon-do. Specifically, Beopheungsa Temple is situated on the southern slopes of Mt. Sajasan (1,180.4 m), or \u201cLion Mountain,\u201d in English, just east of Chiaksan National Park. Beopheungsa Temple was first established under the name Heungnyeongsa Temple, which means \u201cProsperous Peaceful Temple,\u201d in English, by the famed monk Jajang-yulsa (590-658 A.D.) in 643 A.D. The temple was first established by Jajang-yulsa to house the sari (crystallized remains) of Seokgamoni-bul (The Historical Buddha). Alongside five other current sites, these sites are known as Jeokmyeol-bogung, or \u201cSilent Nirvana Treasure Palace,\u201d in English. After having returned to the Korean peninsula from his travels to China in 643 A.D., Jajang-yulsa helped spread Buddhism throughout the Silla Kingdom. The way in which Jajang-yulsa attempted to further this was by establishing Jeokmyeol-bogung temples.\nIn addition to Beopheungsa Temple, formerly Heungnyeongsa Temple, being a Jeokmyeol-bogung temple, it was also one of the Gusan Seonmun, or \u201cNine Mountain Meditation Gates,\u201d in English, which were the nine original Korean Seon (Zen) sects. Specifically, the Mt. Sajasan sect of Korean Seon Buddhism was established by the master monk Doyun (797-868 A.D.). Master Doyun studied under the monk Nanquan Puyuan (748-835 A.D.).\nThe temple was destroyed by fire in 891 A.D., but it was later rebuilt in 944 A.D. For centuries, the temple flourished, until it fell into disrepair during the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910). It wasn\u2019t until 1902, when the temple was reconstructed, that the temple was renamed Beopheungsa Temple. The temple was destroyed, once again, in 1912. It was later rebuilt in 1930. Sadly, older parts of the temple like stone pagodas, were lost in a landslide in 1931. Again, the temple was destroyed; this time, during the Korean War (1950-1953). Beopheungsa Temple was rebuilt, once more, during the 1970\u2019s. And this reconstruction continues to the present day.\nBeopheungsa Temple is home to one Korean Treasure. Additionally, Beopheungsa Temple participates in the popular Temple Stay program in Korea.\nYou first approach the temple grounds at Beopheungsa Temple up a road that\u2019s lined with beautiful, mature trees. Halfway up the road, you\u2019ll come to the temple\u2019s Iljumun Gate. The beautiful Iljumun, or \u201cOne Pillar Gate,\u201d in English, is adorned with dragon and elephant stone bases around the twin pillars that support the entry gate.\nHaving made your way up the rest of the road that leads to the temple grounds, you\u2019ll be greeted by the two-story Woneum-ru Pavilion. The first floor of the pavilion acts as an entry gate to the rest of the temple, while the second story houses the large temple drum. Having passed through the entry pavilion, you\u2019ll notice a collection of buildings to your right. These are facilities for the monks, as well as the temple\u2019s gift shop and visitors centre. To the left of the Woneum-ru Pavilion is the expansive temple courtyard. While the courtyard is largely unoccupied in its present form, it must have been something wonderful to see during Beopheungsa Temple\u2019s heyday.\nThe Geukrak-jeon Hall acts as the temple\u2019s main hall. The exterior walls to the Geukrak-jeon Hall are only adorned with the traditional dancheong colours. With that being said, there\u2019s a beautiful, but diminutive, stone lantern reminiscent of the historic one found at Beopjusa Temple, which can be found in front of the Geukrak-jeon Hall. Sitting inside the Geukrak-jeon Hall is a triad centred by Amita-bul (The Buddha of the Western Paradise). This statue is joined on either side by Jijang-bosal (The Bodhisattva of the Afterlife) and Gwanseeum-bosal (The Bodhisattva of Compassion). All three are beautifully adorned with"

Many depict that it only entails collecting a piece of evidence and running it through a computer to apprehend a suspect. In reality, investigations and law enforcement aren\u2019t simple. Investigations can take weeks, months, or years to tie the evidence to a specific person. But that doesn\u2019t mean that innovations aren\u2019t catching up.\nNow, innovations are transforming police work by introducing new categories of crime and new tools to fight them. One excellent example is deploying and using drones to fight criminal activities. Here\u2019s a list of the most critical technologies utilized by law enforcement agencies, allowing them to protect and serve further. It can include artificial intelligence, facial recognition software, body-worn cameras, and drones.\nUsing facial recognition software is one of the most controversial innovations. When law enforcement agencies started using this innovation, the public was worried others will also this for unethical reasons. Fortunately, that hasn\u2019t been the case, and this innovation is proven to be an efficient investigative tool.\nLaw enforcement agencies use this tool to improve security and safety in different circumstances. It\u2019ll help local officers apprehend a criminal within the shortest time possible. Because it\u2019s promising, the US government speculates that they\u2019ll use this innovation on 93 percent of travelers by 2023.\nOfficers\u2019 patrol cars also double as a command center, meaning they can use different tools and computers while on the road. However, safely multi-tasking can be challenging because there are numerous features available. One of the latest tools the police department incorporated into their patrol cars is voice command technology.\nIt allows police officers to control different functions while performing other duties and driving. Not all vehicles have the same function, but most can handle turning on a siren or running a license plate. It also allows officers to file reports more easily, in which they can dictate their notes before logging into their agency\u2019s RMS system.\nMany homeowners have already installed video doorbells to give them peace of mind and strengthen home security. But these innovative home features also help officers during criminal investigations. In 2020, US law enforcement agencies received nearly 20,000 requests for footage captured by video doorbells and other security cameras.\nIn addition, Amazon, a prominent distributor, signed nearly 2,000 agreements with law enforcement agencies, allowing them to automatically ask homeowners for footage if they leave near a crime scene.\nThermal imaging is another innovation that police officers use. It\u2019s beneficial in dark conditions. Thermal image cameras, which can come in small, hand-held units, use infrared lighting to detect heat emitted by animals or human beings and provide a heat map or heat picture of their surroundings. Law enforcement agencies also use this innovation to track suspects\u2019 movements in dark buildings.\nIt can also be helpful in life-and-death situations, including search and rescue missions and firefighting. For example, officers searching for someone in a blinding snowstorm.\nInnovations in police cruisers resulted in upgrades like fingertip access to Wi-Fi-ready in-dash computers, tablets, and laptops. It gives officers instant access to essential communication systems, information, and more. Innovative dashcam features are also helpful for accountability and evidentiary purposes, gathering information, and police surveillance. Other cruisers even feature next-generation safety features.\nIt was difficult to get footage of police officers doing their jobs in challenging situations in the past. But it has become accessible in this modern age, as noticeable in numerous high-profile incidents that have drawn intense media and public scrutiny. More and more communities and cities choose to equip their police officers with body-worn cameras.\nIt gave supervisors and the public access to a street-level view of on-duty offices, firing the debate about the impact and importance of this technology. In addition to being more durable, less cumbersome, and smaller, you incorporate body-worn cameras with in-car systems. It\u2019ll provide synchronized video of a situation from different angles.\nIt also includes other innovations like heightened resistance to environmental conditions, wider fields of vision, clearer audio, and higher resolution. Other related innovations now feature innovative holsters designed to activate the body camera the office draws or fires their weapons. Most gun insurance companies require their clients to use this innovation. It\u2019ll be helpful if they lose their firearms in the line of duty or are stolen by criminal elements.\nLocal authorities should learn about the pros and cons of using these innovations to make informed decisions on what their communities and departments should be paying for. Because police technology is rapidly changing, leaders should stay well-informed about these because it\u2019ll be helpful for the safety of their officers and the public.<|endoftext|>Wrap yourself in the warm and soothing energies of this Loving Kindness Tumbled Rhodochrosite.

I\u2019ve learned plenty of things. How has this experience opened my mind?\nI\u2019ve always believed that attending university is the best thing that you can do. Actually, I\u2019ve recently changed my mind. After four years of lessons and exams, I\u2019m impatient to put into action the things that I\u2019ve learned. Professors give us a lot of fundamental notions, but we haven\u2019t had the possibility of putting them into practice (at least in Italy, where I attended university). This is the reason why I chose to come here and starting my real professional life. I find out that I\u2019d rather be working instead of studying. It will be hard going back to study in Italy (I still have a few courses to finish up). I love ending my day: no studying, no heavy books and no names to remember.\nIt\u2019s unbelievable the amount of things that you can do for free in this city. I suggest you to visit the page Madrid Free to discover them all! Workshops, museums, cinemas, temporary expositions, theathers and so on! Don\u2019t miss them! Search on the web (Madrid Free is the best page, in my opinion, but there are more, check out Madrid Gratis and Freezity, for instance).\nIf you get the Abono Joven metro pass (for young people under 26), you can visit lots of towns in the surroundings of Madrid for free. Check out my article on the best places that you can visit here. Every day, free workshops are held, from yoga to English classes.\nDo you want to discover the city without paying? There are free guided tours, too. Don\u2019t miss the opportunity of enjoying everything that the city offers!\nAfter staying a year in Paris and having to live with the smell of the Parisian metro, I\u2019ve finally found the cleanest and most efficient metro I\u2019ve ever seen. Granted, I have not traveled everywhere in the world, so some of my readers may not agree with me here. But the 20 Euro metro pass is really unique! Get one.\nMadrid isn\u2019t as big as other capitals. (Again, I have not traveled everywhere, so please you can disagree with me!) You can go almost everywhere by walking. Even if you don\u2019t live in the city centre, you can reach it in twenty minutes thanks to RENFE trains.\nAnother perfect alternative is the bicycle, in my opinion. You can rent it! There are many bike sharing stations around the city.\nDuring my first days in Madrid, whenever I went to a shop I always"

Whether the activity to them \u2013 their personality \u2013 fits, even though it is less important whether very many positions available in each area.\nExactly what seriously concerns study regarding biology?\nThe definitive aspect is the awareness that a person is accountable for his learning regardless of recommended by doctors curricula. Just essential reports ought to use to amass the broadest potential foundation of knowledge and a wide variety of skills. If necessary to draw on knowledge that is outside the special area, on a broad basis you can then specialize very good and especially later in a changing labor market. Life time discovering is an issue of course for each biologists.\nWhat can you pass up in today\u2019s entrants?\nMercilessly demanded by the graduate students, although independent thought and action is unfortunately less and less taught in the relatively schooled courses. I would personally recommend to: Dear one semester can show too much under his belt, but real experience abroad or a longer internship. Companies want to seek the services of men and women, not robots.\nAre there techniques for the right occupation?\nPrimarily you need as being a biologist a job \u2013 the right one. Because of this you should not put on frantically all firms that occur to an individual. Without the need of concrete points, z. As through personal contacts at career events, today I would submit not only more unsolicited application.\nApplications will probably be partly examined by personal computers on buzzwords for the reason that it may be greater an excessive amount of than call a technical word too little. Not in the letter, since it is expected that can be summed up his application with maximum clarity on 20 lines.\nHow could you gain as a biologist a great deal?\nI will not mention any specific figures here, but you earn good money. From the chemical like and pharmaceutical drug industry is not really a distinction which reports have been finalized. The following is just essential in the starting off salaries, no matter whether you do have a PhD and no matter whether you may prove professional practical experience out of doors academia previously.\nYou can find obvious-tariff prerequisites which do not pertain to all firms. It\u2019s like actively playing supply, demand and football control the purchase price. In particular, nonetheless, additionally, it is vital that employees creation concept comes after the firm.

Regardless of the reason why you are in need of these services, it will be important that you find the right service provider whom you are going to work with. Not just any other company will deliver you with the kind of services you are looking for and thus you must go for the one that will offer you with highly reliable services. However, every business owner will ask themselves about which one will be the best company to select when it comes to transcription services. In case you have never been in the market before, then you might feel overwhelmed by the multiple options you are offered with. This is the reasons why before you start searching for the service provider you are going to select, make sure that you know what you are looking for and the necessary features to check on when making your decision. You must strive to find a reliable, reputable and also an experienced service provider who will deliver you with quality services that will match the price you pay.\nThere are a sheer number of transcription service providers that you will come across in the industry today and thus it won\u2019t be easy for you to make the right decision.

Not any other company will be right for you and you must find the one that will meet your needs and wants. There are a number of factors that one needs to check on when it comes to choosing a transcription service provider. The following are some of the factors that one needs to check on when choosing this service provider.\nOne factor that you ought to check for when choosing a transcription service provider is their accuracy and quality. It will be very important that before selecting any service provider, make sure you have assessed the quality of services they offer. A reliable company is the one that will offer you with a minimum of ninety nine percent. Every transcription service provider you come across will claim to offer high accuracy services but you need to know whether they can guarantee this. You can do so by talking with their past clients or even checking the reviews and feedback from past clients. Another factor that one needs to check on when it comes to choosing a transcription service provider is checking on their pricing. Price is one of the factors you ought to check on but not the most important one.

This bryophyte was previously reported near the Sangwangbong peak of Gayasan Mountain as an unrecorded species in Korea and has more recently been found in Jirisan Mountain, Hallasan Mountain, and Sobaeksan Mountain (Choi et al., 2012; Choi et al., unpubl. data).

Bethel also requires daily temperature checks, health status monitoring through a self-screening app, and individuals to wear face masks indoors and outdoors on the campus.\n\"Mandatory testing during reopening is an effective way to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 in our student and employee population at the start of the semester,\" said Bethel College President Jon Gering. \"Our efforts have provided valuable public health information and revealed important health information for students and their families.\"\nThe individuals have been able to self-isolate on campus or at their permanent residence. Bethel College's Emergency Response Team, along with the Health Department, will regularly monitor the health of the individuals, as well as follow up on all close contacts.\nStudents, faculty and staff, as well as community members, can consult Bethel's COVID-19 information clearinghouse on its website at https://www.bethelks.edu/coronavirus-information. The site includes a link to Bethel's COVID procedures, which outlines scenarios based on possible infections and infection rates.<|endoftext|>Happy Christmas from Honduras!\nThanks for dropping by this site over the last year.

On it, there was a photo of a great big casserole topped with melted cheese. And the title was something like: Casseroles for a crowd. I don\u2019t ever need a crowd to make a casserole. In fact, I could eat one of twenty-five cheesy baked casseroles rotated in succession every day for the rest of my life and be perfectly happy. Maybe a salad. With a side of bread. And dessert. Because it\u2019s delicious.\nBut it\u2019s not good for me or for any of us. If anyone is seeking truth, this might be a good truism: All the really good things are bad if you have/do it too much. Good food, alcohol, sex (I know, I said it out loud), sleep. You get the picture. So, in the scheme of what we like and want, we must use self-control, or often self-deprivation to stay healthy, both physically and mentally. Even then, our bodies and minds can go haywire. God, Karma, the Force, someone\u2013or something, is making sure we don\u2019t have too much fun or get too much sleep, lest we resemble Jabba the Hutt.\nAll of these things that humans love are motivators in healthy doses. And we so often want and need more. Our desire to feel good or better can be at the root of addictions of every kind.\nI\u2019m from a close Southern family where food has always been a celebratory glue that brings and binds us together. But I understand that there are others who only eat to live, not live to eat. It baffles me, but it has to better for long-term health. Fortunately, we live to be in our nineties, so there is that.\nMy love of cheese is legend, and the backside of middle-age and having to cut back is frustrating me, especially when I\u2019m hit with the beautiful casserole images all around social media.\nI\u2019m looking forward to Spring and home-grown tomatoes. Believe it or not, I love healthy things too.\nEdited: Here\u2019s the really delicious lasagna recipe. It\u2019s not a quick one, but if you have some time, go for it!! You use less cheese because of the white sauce.\nCombine beef and pork (or sausage) in pot and season with salt and pepper. Lightly brown and drain, then add white pepper, onions, celery, garlic, italian seasoning and carrot. Cook on med. heat until veggies wilt. Add milk and cook for about fifteen min. Add white wine and cook for another fifteen min. Add tomato paste or Ragu and cook for about ten minutes then turn heat down to simmer for about thirty min.\nAdd milk to separate pot and whisk in flour while cold. Add butter and heat on med/hi until mixture comes to a slow boil, then turn very low. Continue whisking the entire time so the sauce doesn\u2019t stick together or the pot. After it boils, turn off.\nSpoon 3/4 cup bechamel sauce into meat sauce to thicken. Keep both sauces handy for layering.\nI use no-boil lasagna noodles.\nLayer the noodles, meat sauce, bechamel sauce drizzle, and Parmesan cheese in four layers and top with the rest of bechamel sauce and Mozzarella.\nBake according to instructions on pasta box. Around 45 min. at 400 degrees.\nI do love cheese and cheesy casseroles.\nPrevious PostIt\u2019s Up For Pre-Grabs!<|endoftext|>Raffles Hotel in Singapore is a legendary property \u2013 it had only a few bungalows when it opened in 1887 but now offers 103 suites with 65 boutiques and stores as well as food and beverage outlets in the hotel\u2019s arcades.\nThe fabulous colonial-style hotel weathered difficult times from its inception, such as the Great Depression and WWII.

This dis-ease is compounded as the world plunges into the scary, anxious unknown of a global pandemic. Our well ordered, taken for granted worlds are not working. The narrative of liberal globalisation is unable to address this malaise and as it wanes, new questions are emerging. What takes their place? What\u2019s next? In what ways is God leading us and shaping Christian imagination for the sake of the Common Good in the midst of these massive shifts?\nOn 30 April we held a trans-Atlantic webinar to focus on these questions, with Guest Lord Maurice Glasman and Hosts Alan Roxburgh from the Journal of Missional Practice and Jenny Sinclair from Together for the Common Good.\nNinety-eight invited church leaders from across the UK, US, Canada and beyond participated in this live webinar via Zoom, along with many more watching via Facebook live.\nThe webinar took place thanks to a generative and generous partnering between Together for the Common Good and the Journal of Missional Practice. We are excited about the conversations we are having together about this period of seismic change, the importance of place, the implications for mission and the churches\u2019 role in the renewal of civic life.\nDownload Lord Glasman\u2019s notes here.\nTo explore Common Good Thinking, click here.\nWebinar Guest: Lord Glasman is a Labour Peer in the British Parliament, Director of the Common Good Foundation and founder of Blue Labour. His work has been influential across party lines. His engagement with Catholic social thought over more than twenty years has informed his political thinking and community organising work, both in the UK and internationally.\nMaurice\u2019s framing invited us into a conversation around the seismic changes taking place in western societies and the implications for our churches in the renewal of civic life. See this article published in the New Statesman: The coronavirus crisis has sounded the death knell for liberal globalisation.\nThe approach taken in this webinar was generated through five weeks of generative and energising conversations between the Journal of Missional Practice [Martin Robinson and Mary Publicover (from ForMission College) from Birmingham UK, and Al Roxburgh and Sara Jane Walker (from The Missional Network) from Vancouver, Canada], Maurice Glasman (Common Good Foundation) and Jenny Sinclair (Together for the Common Good) from London, UK.<|endoftext|>Somewhere in my first few months of learning Korean, I was listening to my usual grammar lessons when the speaker introduced an expression that I now often find myself inserting into English sentences \u2013 at least mentally.\nWhen I see or hear something for the first time and I have a positive reaction to it, I can say in English, \u201cI like it,\u201d whether it\u2019s music, clothing, food, or a place. In Korean, saying \u201cI like [something]\u201d indicates that I\u2019m familiar with it already, and yes, I like it. A first sight of a pretty dress, a first listen to a hit song, a first view of a beautiful place, all merit the uniquely Korean expression, \u201cIt enters my heart.\u201d For those who read Korean: \ub9c8\uc74c\uc5d0 \ub4e4\uc5b4\uc694. For those who can\u2019t: ma-eum-e dul-eoyo.\nLearning the Korean language is more than a self-inflicted mental challenge for me: I am privileged to be in South Korea, experiencing the beginnings of a small Bruderhof community of about twenty people ranging from five to eighty-five years old: foreigners and Koreans, families and singles. Initially, we lived in separate apartment buildings in the city of Taebaek. Earlier this year, we all moved to a countryside property in Yeongwol to better share a communal life and welcome visitors. With help from neighbors, we\u2019re learning which vegetables grow best, how much rain monsoons bring, how much one local rooster can crow, and more.\nMountains surround the Bruderhof community in Yeongwol, South Korea.\nBy now, days fly by quickly in Yeongwol, but they didn\u2019t at first. One April morning, I woke up to the sound of rain pattering on the carport roof below my window. I love that sound. April showers aren\u2019t assumed in Korea; springtime is a dry season complete with wildfires. Additionally, dust blowing in from China\u2019s vast deserts (not to mention the airborne import of \u201cmade in China\u201d pollution) makes rain a welcome air purifier and fire extinguisher.\nRaindrops spoke comfort but didn\u2019t wash away the nagging feeling that this wasn\u2019t home. I\u2019m a nature lover, so the imposing mountains, the river, the big sky, should have grabbed my heart, but their charms had only gotten detached mental acknowledgement from me. Evening jogs lacked their usual pleasure: I missed having large apartment buildings nearby, the sound of a train pausing traffic, the brightly lit little storefronts, the small, easy-to-climb mountains, and the people \u2013 those I knew and those I didn\u2019t. I knew my new home had to take root in my heart at some point. I just needed time and a catalyst.\nI got up to take a pre-breakfast walk in the pattering rain. I took a now-familiar route down the road, across the bridge, and back. Something happened. The white mist gently suspended near the tops of the dark gray-green mountains and the silver-highlighted river caught my heart. Ma-eum-e dul-eoyo. It enters my heart. I didn\u2019t know the place well yet and I wouldn\u2019t have thought a gray morning could have such bewitching beauty. But it did. Something clicked and my new home felt like, well, home.\nOnce more, the season pauses a moment, as if giving me a chance to catch up. Almost as if aware that their deep green summer look is getting old, the mountainside trees grab my attention again with autumnal brilliance. Yellows and oranges, dark pines and bright red maples match my memories of autumns in New York. With the spreading colors, my own sense of belonging is growing. The river, teeming with large birds (that everyone else can name), captivates me as much as each subtle sunset beyond the dusty blue mountains. At night, the stars seem closer than before.\nMy old home still holds a firm and special place in my heart, but it has moved over to share the space. I like this new home. It has entered my heart.<|endoftext|>Hammam is yet another popular Moroccan style used in home interiors. India Circus has taken inspiration from this design for the Golden Hamman Lantern.

Men are expected to pay all household bills and are not allowed to touch any funds with which women may have entered the marriage.  They have the right to spend their money in any way they see fit, even to contribute to the running of the household if they desire to do so. They may own property in their own name and invest or spend their own money as they choose.\nWhat is fiction and what is fact in this ideal world of female empowerment? We surveyed selected women nationals of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) living in Abu Dhabi and invited a small number to participate in focus groups to determine the extent to which they actually control their personal funds. The essential question governing the study was, \u201cHow do Muslim women handle their money?\u201d The purpose of the research was to examine the beliefs and culture of Muslim women with regard to acquiring, managing, and investing money. Do they have funds of their own? Are they totally controlled by the men in their lives? What freedoms do they enjoy? Are there areas of need that are common to all women that might be addressed through education? Results of the survey and an analysis of comments and perceptions from the focus groups are presented below.\nSubjects were volunteers including married and unmarried students at a women\u2019s university, female members of their families, and female teachers and staff in schools in Abu Dhabi.

Vinegar and baking soda are extremely powerful and also very inexpensive. You can clean your counter tops, toilet, and all of your appliances with them. Lets be honest, there isn\u2019t much these two can\u2019t do. We know they are amazing, but do you ever wonder what makes them so green and so effective? Keep reading for a brief explanation of both these products.\nBaking soda comes from a box, right? Well yes\u2026but how did it get in the box? A lot of science goes into making such a useful product. To keep it simple, sodium bicarbonate is created by separating soda ash in a centrifuge, introducing carbon dioxide, and processing it through a series of filters. Simple, right? Enotes.com provides this diagram to see exactly how the process works. We are not all scientists, but at least we know a little more about where baking soda comes from.\n Vinegar is produced from various fruits by two biological processes. The first process is called alcoholic fermentation, which happens when yeast changes sugars into alcohol. The other process uses bacteria to change the alcohol into acetic acid. Although acetic acid is a main ingredient in vinegar, they are not the same thing. Vinegar also contains many vitamins, minerals, and salts from the primary source.

With respect to CMSA, CCI noted that it undertakes commercial functions and is therefore, an enterprise under Section 4 of the CA02. Noting its own prior decisions on abuse of buyer power[2], CCI noted that the relevant market has to be delineated by applying \u2018demand side substitutability\u2019 inversely i.e. by assessing the availability of substitutes for suppliers and their ability to switch to alternative sales opportunities. Therefore, CCI decided the relevant market to be \u2018market for male condoms in India\u2019.\nCCI held that the market shares of CMSA identified by the informant did not reveal a true picture and hence failed to establish dominance of CMSA. CCI further held that having social objectives, CMSA did not have any incentive to influence the relevant market particularly when it procures 75% of its requirements from a single company. With regard to the allegation under Section 3(4), CCI held that the printing requirements of CMSA do not restrict the informant from dealing with other customers.

Lolli (on brief) of Beckett & Steinkamp, Kansas City, Mo., argued, for appellant; Theodore C. Beckett, Kansas City, Mo., on brief.\nCharles C. Shafer, Jr., Kansas City, Mo., for appellee.\nBefore BRIGHT, HENLEY and McMILLIAN, Circuit Judges.\nAppellant, Town & Country Estates, Inc., appeals from a judgment entered on a jury verdict in favor of appellee, Li Ren Fong, on Fong's claim that he was defrauded by Town & Country. The jury awarded Fong $14,400 in actual damages and $65,600 in punitive damages.\nIn September, 1974, Li Ren Fong entered into a lease agreement with Town & Country Estates, which managed the Windmill Square Shopping Center in Overland Park, Kansas, which was under construction and scheduled for completion in November, 1974. The five-year lease provided for a space in the shopping center at a minimum monthly rent of $534. As provided in the agreement, the retail space Fong rented consisted merely of bare concrete walls and floor. Fong installed drywalls, petitions, ceilings, plumbing, light fixtures and other improvements which were necessary to establish a retail gift shop. On December 7, 1974, Fong opened his shop.\nOn November 15, 1975, Fong instituted the present suit alleging that he was falsely induced to lease the space by Lee M. Fowler, vice-president of Town & Country, who represented that at the time Fong negotiated his lease, fifty percent of the shopping center was already leased. Count I of the complaint sought rescission of the lease agreement and $150,000 damages. Count II sought $150,000 actual damages and $500,000 punitive damages. On December 1, 1975, Town & Country sold the shopping center and the new owner released Fong from his lease obligations. In April, 1976, Fong vacated the premises. Because Fong had been released from his rental contract by the new owners of the shopping center, he dropped his claim for rescission in Count I prior to trial.\nhaving found the issues in favor of the plaintiff you must award plaintiff such sum as you believe will fairly and justly compensate plaintiff for any actual damages you believe he sustained as a direct result of the occurrence mentioned in the evidence.\nIn this diversity case Missouri law controls and appellant's statement of the Missouri law on damages is correct. Both the \"benefit-of-the-bargain\" and \"out-of-pocket\" damage awards seek to award a plaintiff damages for the losses proximately caused by the defendant's fraud. Cf. Kendrick v. Ryus, 225 Mo. 150, 123 S.W. 937, 939 (Mo.1909). \"Benefit-of-the-bargain\" damages are awarded when the defrauded party retains the property while \"out-of-pocket\" damages are awarded when the defrauded party rescinds the agreement and returns the property. Salmon v. Brookshire, supra, 301 S.W.2d at 54; Schroeder v. Zykan, 255 S.W.2d 105, 110 (Mo.App.1953). This is because the \"benefit-of-the-bargain\" measure of damages allows the injured party to retain the property and collect as damages the amount \"the property would have been worth if it had been as represented.\" Kendrick v. Ryus, supra, 123 S.W. at 939. This measure of damage is, by definition therefore, based upon retention of the property. Salmon v. Brookshire, supra, 301 S.W.2d at 54. In comparison, an award of \"out-of-pocket\" damages is premised upon the assumption that the injured party has returned the property and is entitled to the expenses which were incurred in accepting and then rescinding the agreement. Id.; Schroeder v. Zykan, supra, 255 S.W.2d at 110; Accord, Salter v. Heiser, 39 Wash.2d 826, 239 P.2d 327, 330 (1951).\nThe damage instructions here, which the parties classify as allowing \"out-of-pocket\" expenses, were proper because plaintiff was no longer in possession of the premises or even obligated to lease the premises when the amount of damages was assessed. Granted, rescission is generally sought simultaneously with a request for out-of-pocket damages, See, e. g., Miller v. Andy Burger Motors, Inc., 370 S.W.2d 654, 660 (Mo.App.1963); Schroeder v. Zykan, supra, 255 S.W.2d at 111, but by the time of trial Fong was not seeking rescission.4 However, as can be seen from Fong's complaint, he initially sought rescission simultaneously with his request for out-of-pocket damages. It was because of the peculiar events in this case, namely, the new owners of the shopping center released Fong from his lease after his complaint had been filed and before trial commenced, that it was no longer necessary for Fong to seek rescission by the time trial began. This failure to seek rescission simultaneously with a request for out-of-pocket damages does not negate the propriety of the out-of-pocket damage award in this case. The Sine qua non of whether out-of-pocket damages rather than benefit-of-the-bargain damages should be awarded is whether the defrauded party retains the property at issue. Here Fong no longer retains the property; therefore, out-of-pocket damages are appropriate.\nAppellant also contends that the award of punitive damages was erroneous. It advances two arguments: first, there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of legal malice which must be proven to obtain punitive damages, Ackmann v. Keeney-Toelle Real Estate Co., 401 S.W.2d 483, 489 (Mo. banc 1966); and second, appellant argues that, even if the elements for punitive damages were proven, the amount awarded was excessive. We reject both arguments. \"The question of whether or not punitive damages shall be awarded and, if so, in what amount rests peculiarly in the discretion of the jury.\" Wisner v. S. S. Kresge Co., 465 S.W.2d 666, 669 (Mo.Ct.App.1971); Accord, Northern v. McGraw-Edison Co., 542 F.2d 1336, 1349-50 (8th Cir. 1976), Cert. denied sub nom. McGraw-Edison Co. v. Soper, 429 U.S. 1097, 97 S.Ct. 1115, 51 L.Ed.2d 544 (1977). Appellant has not even attempted to produce evidence as to why the jury erred in finding legal malice or how it erred in assessing the amount of punitive damages. We therefore defer to the jury's determination.<|endoftext|>Da Nang Han Market is a traditional market with a variety of goods on sale, bustling dining area, souvenir and specialty stalls\u2026.has become an indispensable attraction of tourists whenever they visit Da Nang.

The district was referred to as Maesohol-hyeon, until it was renamed Soseong-hyeon after the unification of the three kingdoms, under the rule of King Gyeongdeok. At the time of King Sukjong (1095-1105) of the Goryeo Dynasty, this area, which was the place of origin of the king\u2019s maternal family, was granted a higher administrative status, and renamed Gyeongwon-gun. Subsequently, under the reign of King Injong (1122-1146), the place was again moved up the hierarchy of administrative division system, this time in honor of the Lee clan of Gyeongwon (Inju), the king\u2019s mother\u2019s family, and renamed Inju. Following the rebellion of Lee Ja-gyeom, the clan was severely weakened. In the 2nd year of King Gongyang (1390), Inju was discarded in favor of its earlier name, Gyeongwon-bu.\nThe region had a close tie to Goryeo\u2019s royal house over seven successive reigns, garnering the nickname \u2018Childaeeohyang\u2019 (meaning literally \u2018seven-generation royal homestead\u2019).\nThis day is today commemorated in Incheon as Citizens\u2019 Day.\nA gateway to Northeast Asia with both international port and international airport in its hand, Incheon is located in the mid-west Korea peninsula abutting the Yellow Sea. A city located 28km from the nation\u2019s capital, Seoul, lies at 126\u00b0 37\u00b4 of east longitude and 37\u00b0 28\u00b4 of north latitude. San Francisco, Washington, Madrid, and Teheran are found on the same latitude.\nThe Incheon area has a relatively dry climate. It is affected greatly by seasonal wind. The northwesterly wind hits the region in winter, while the southwesterly wind blows in summer. The average annual temperature is around 11.4\u00b0C, while the average temperature during the month of January is around 3.1\u00b0C below zero and that during the month of August is around 24.9\u00b0C. The difference over the year is 28\u00b0C.\nThe local GNP for Incheon is \\25 trillion 517.7 billion, 4.7% of the national GNP. More than 1.2 million people in the region are participating in various economic activities. Incheon displays an urban-type industrial structure, which is characterized with the tertiary industry relatively larger than the primary or secondary industry. There are seven industrial complexes in the region, including Namdong and Bupyeong, which host more than 7,400 companies altogether.\nIncheon was promoted to a city under direct government supervision on July 1, 1981. On January 1,1989, Gyeyang-myeon of Gimpo-gun and other districts of Gyeonggi-do Province, including Yeongjong-myeon and Yongyu-myeon of Ongjin-gun were merged into the city.\nIncheon was then changed to a metropolitan city on January 1, 1995. On the following March 1, the entire area of Ganghwa-gun and Ongjin-gun as well as Geomdan-myeon of Gimpo-gun was added to the Incheon Metropolitan City.\nThe current administrative unit covers a total area of 986.45km\u00b2, or 0.98% of the entire South Korea. It is made of eight districts, two counties, and 140 smaller units, including eup, myeon, and dong.\nAs of September 2017, the city has a total population of 3,008,552 with more than 1,183,886 households. Incheon is now rapidly developing into the third largest city in Korea, with Seoul and Busan being the first and the second largest, respectively.\nExcept for Mt. Manisan (469m) and Mt. Gyeyangsan (395m), most mountains in the Incheon area are not taller than 300m above the sea level. Since hilly mountains are well developed along the coast, there is only a limited size of flat landing the area.

They are classified according to purity, percentage of alcohol contained, whether or not distilled, and materials used. There are largely five types: yakju (refined pure liquor fermented from rice), soju (distilled liquor), takju (thick, unrefined liquor fermented from grains), fruit wines, and medicinal wines from various seeds and roots. Each type has dozens of varieties.\nFamous cheongju is a yakju and popular makgeolli is a takju. Acacia, maesil plum, Chinese quince, cherry, pine fruits, and pomegranate are some of popular materials to make fruit wines. Insamju is a representative example of medicinal wine, made from ginseng.\nWell-known examples of cheongju are beopju, sogokju and baekhaju.\nA milky liquor with low alcohol content, the traditional commoner's beverage enjoyed by farmers and laborers, but by business people as well. They are served at drinking houses around universities, at festivals, picnic areas, or anywhere people might enjoy a mild drink with a fermented flavor.\nComparable to vodka but less potent, soju is the most popular traditional Korean liquor among the general public. Soju was originally brewed from grains; today is mass-produced mainly from sweet potatoes.\nA distilled liquor brewed from wheat, millet and Indian millet. It is given the scent and flavor of the crab apple, which is called munbae. Its brewing skill is designated as an Important Intangible Cultural Property by the Korean government along with that of dugyeonju (azalea wine) from Myeoncheon, Dangjin-gun, Chungcheongnam-do and Gyodong Beopju from Gyeongju.\nKoreans offer glasses of liquor to each other as a gesture of camaraderie. When someone offers you an empty liquor glass, you are expected to hold it and receive a fill-up, drink it empty, and in likewise fashion return it to the person who offered it to you. This drinking tradition helps promote close ties around a drinking table.\nIt is a rule of courtesy for juniors to pour liquor for their seniors. The juniors have to keep paying attention not to leave a senior's glass empty. When a senior offers a junior a glass, the junior should receive it with two hands and drink with head turned aside, not facing the senior. It is also the custom to cup the right sleeve with the left hand when pouring drink for a senior.\nIn the past, Korean drinking houses used to prepare special soup to cure the hangovers of customers who had drunk the night before. This beef-bone broth fortified with dried outer cabbage leaves and clotted ox blood, called baejangguk, is still a morning-after favorite.<|endoftext|>Stacie Moss, owner of Etsy shop Penguin Yarns, has been knitting pink-hued \u201cpussy hats\u201d for up to 10 hours each day for the past several days, stopping every couple of hours to ice her sore wrists and stretch her aching joints.\nMoss is one of several Etsy owners who went into overdrive to meet high demand for the cat ear\u2013shaped knit caps, a popular accoutrement among participants of the women\u2019s marches that took place last weekend in protest of the inauguration of President Donald Trump.\nNow three days after the marches \u2014 which took place in cities around the world and convened an estimated one million people in the U.S. alone \u2014 there are more than 60,000 Instagram posts tagged with #pussyhat or #pussyhatproject, and an Etsy search for the hats yields 1,262 results. The pussy hat phenomenon has demonstrated not just the power of Instagram to promote grassroots social movements, but also the ability of fashion to catalyze activism.\nKay Baxter, owner of Etsy shop Kay Crochet Patterns, said despite the empowering nature of the term, several customers struggled with using the word in email requests for the hats, opting instead for an asterisk or simply \u201cp-word.\u201d Baxter has received 120 requests in the past two days from cities around the U.S., as well as from users in Australia, Canada, England and New Zealand. She also offers men\u2019s sizes, which she said have received significant interest.\nBoth Baxter and Moss said the hats have generated several first-time Etsy users and have been a significant boost to their businesses. Moss has generated more business this month alone than in the last six months of 2016, and Baxter said several stores in her community have completely sold out of pink yarn.\nFashion has long played a role in social movements \u2014 take the white dresses donned by members of the women\u2019s suffrage movement during marches and demonstrations for voting rights in the early 1900s. Hillary Clinton herself made a nod to this when she appeared in an all-white pantsuit at the inauguration, and she made a similar statement when she wore a purple jacket during her concession speech as an ode to bipartisanship.\nRachel Saunders, director of insights and strategy at the agency Cassandra, echoed Budson, and said social movements in the digital era have helped inspire a new demographic of young activists who use social media to showcase their activist fashions.\nAccording to data from Brandwatch, there were 49,000 mentions of pussy hat or The Pussyhat Project online. On January 21, the day of the marches, there were 22,000 mentions alone. While 79 percent of mentions were positive, Kellan Terry, analyst at Brandwatch, said the remaining 21 percent of negative comments were \u201cattack-like in nature,\u201d emphasizing the divisive nature of inauguration weekend.\nWomen comprised two-thirds of all unique mentions of the pussy hat or The Pussyhat Project.\nThough women were behind the majority of hat purchases and comprised most of the participants in the global marches, Kamerman said that moving forward, The Pussyhat Project will likely offer new iterations of the hat that will test other colors focused on wider inclusivity.<|endoftext|>Famous clowns Pencil, People's Artist of USSR Mikhail Rumyantsev in Gomel with a monument.\nRenowned artist has toured many times in the Gomel circus, in his letters he speaks with gratitude of the Gomel and its inhabitants.

In the human society of a bygone era, predominated by hard physical labor, and which thereby did not necessitate any weight loss diet, people needed a \u2018high carb\u2019 diet to function successfully. But today\u2019s sedentary life style does not require the same amount of carbohydrates and when a person sticks to the same type of diet, the extra calories get stored in the body as fat reserves.\nHowever, a diet completely devoid of carbohydrates cannot be part of any weight loss program. Even a very \u2018low carb\u2019 weight loss diet must have at least 40% of carbohydrates. It can even go up to 65% based upon the constitution of the individual as some are able to process carbohydrates better than others. Of this 65%, at least 55% should ideally be more complex carbohydrates and the remaining 10% sugars.\nAnd low carb or high carb, fruits and vegetables cannot be shown the door from any weight loss diet. Despite the fact that fruits and vegetables do contain a certain amount of starches and sugars, these are essential for body and have to be a part of the diet in any weight loss program. That much carbohydrate is necessary for the body.\nThe overall balancing equation of a low carb diet, as part of weight loss diet, is very simple. One has just to reduce the intake of more starchy stuff like bread or pasta and substitute it with fruits and vegetables and fat free dairy products so that there is less carbohydrates and more roughage and enough of proteins.\nHowever, the efficacy of any weight loss diet depends substantially on the body requirement of the individual. Some may require more carbohydrates than others, based upon the constitution of their bodies, or their level of activities. Reducing carbohydrates too much might turn out to be counterproductive in their cases. The progress of a weight loss program has to be monitored to adjust the calories to match the required energy level.\nIn the case of some people, their body requirement of carbohydrates is such that any form of a low carb diet may not work for them as part of a weight loss program.\nThen there is also the question of the fiber content in the diet. As fiber is essentially a carbohydrate, some feel that a low carb diet, by its very definition, might be one that is low in fiber as well. This is a very erroneous impression.\nFiber, needless to say, has to be an unavoidable ingredient in any weight loss diet, be it a low carb one or not. True, the enzymes of the digestive tract do not have much action on it. That is the essence of its power, because its caloric value is practically zero. At the same time it helps in digestion, and in getting the feeling of satiation, by contributing to the volume of the food.\nA little research into the proffered low carb diets might be ideal to find out a suitable one for a weight loss diet.<|endoftext|>That's actually very helpful.

This unique bi-national collaboration will create a gateway to the rich shared cultural and natural resources of the U.S.-Mexico Border.\nApproximately half of the funds will be used by 4Walls to create park space and a nature reserve in a canyon in Tijuana just south of the border fence known as \u201cLos Sauces.\u201d The park will make use of thousands of discarded plastic soda bottles stuffed with trash as fill material for the construction of park benches and other infrastructure. This innovative construction technique reduces the cost of raw materials, such as cement, while increasing the structures\u2019 strength.\n\u201cWe are proud to partner with the EPA and 4Walls International on this exciting bi-national project demonstrating the value of our shared environmental resources \u2013 air, land and water. This project will help make accessible a beautiful natural area along the border that most people don\u2019t get to experience. It is part of a network of stunning outdoor places for the entire region to enjoy,\u201d said BongHwan \u201cBH\u201d Kim, Executive Director of the San Diego Center for Civic Engagement at The San Diego Foundation.\nOn the U.S. side, 4Walls International will create an inviting, culturally relevant \u201cBorder Gateway to Nature\u201d by improving signage and access points to the park, and by creating artistic elements and park benches made of trash collected from the Tijuana River estuary. The Border Field State Park improvements are scheduled to be completed in October.\nMexico\u2019s Environment Ministry (SEMARNAT) is also contributing significant resources to the beautification of Los Sauces Park. Through the \u201cTemporary Employment Program,\u201d SEMARNAT is employing approximately 100 local residents for 12 weeks to clean the park and replace invasive vegetation with native plants. Phase one of the Los Sauces Park in Tijuana will be completed in September.\nThe Opening the Outdoors initiative at the San Diego Center for Civic Engagement will help reclaim the region\u2019s natural beauty and create world-class urban parks and gateways to nature. The initiative seeks to bring together business, government, and the community to build public awareness and support efforts to establish natural and urban spaces for families to recreate, learn and enjoy. This is the first project of the Opening the Outdoors initiative.<|endoftext|>Athens : University of Georgia Press, c2001.<|endoftext|>At work, safety is key.

Unfortunately, all too often countries protect some citizens at the expense of other citizens. That\u2019s when we get protected classes. For example, in the United States white people are a protected class. They don\u2019t get pulled over for being white. White job applications don\u2019t get thrown away because their names sound too white. Seriously try to imagine a country that culturally demanded Melania Trump and Laura Bush and all the other non-Michelle First Ladies cornrow, dreadlock or put their hair through a chemical curling process. White people are even protected from having to disguise how their hair naturally grows.\nDid you know that in July of 2016 a federal appeals court struck down a North Carolina voter ID law that\u2019s purpose was to \u201ctarget African-Americans with almost surgical precision\u201d? Yup. It\u2019s true. It is also true that there is not now, nor has there ever been, a law anywhere in these United States that attempted to specifically take white peoples\u2019 right to vote away \u201cwith almost surgical precision\u201d or otherwise.\nA consequence of having a protected class is that if the protection is good enough, it is invisible to the protected. This, of course, can lead to the protected class denying its own protection, an act that protects that protection. In other words, the people on top are allowed to believe that their lack of experience is actual experience, and so they become certain that anything that hasn\u2019t"

The boat trip on 3rd off from Daejin (Goseong County) was happily shared with Subhojit Chakladar, and through the help of Ha Jung Moon, with You Jin Sim, Kim Eojin and Koo Hye-In from the University Birding Club.\nHighlights among 135-140 bird and three mammal species logged during our five days together included two Siberian Crane at Yeoncheon, and an adult Steller\u2019s Sea Eagle and 5+ Scaly-sided Merganser on the Han River on the 1st; in Goseong County, a record-breaking count of Red-necked Grebe on 2nd and five Yellow-billed Loon, five species of alcid, a Harbour Seal and a mixed flock of Japanese and Bohemian Waxwings on 3rd; c.50 Hooded Crane, 12 Oriental Stork, an Amur Leopard Cat and a Snow Goose at Seosan and eight Swan Goose, a puzzling curlew and 3,000 Baikal Teal at the Geum on 4th; and c. 10 Yellow-bellied Tit, two Lesser White-fronted Goose, and close-up looks at four Baikal Teal and 40+ Daurian Jackdaw on the 5th.\nSnow Goose Anser caerulescens. An adult was at Seosan on 4th.\nSwan Goose Anser cygnoides. VU. Eight were in the Geum Estuary still on 4th.\nTaiga Bean Goose Anser fabalis. The largest concentration was of 800 on the Han River on 1st.\nTaiga Bean Goose \u00a9 Nial Moores. Note the massive, bulky look; the shallow lower mandible, more or less equal in thickness from the base to the orange bill-band; and the warmer tones to the lower neck.\nTundra Bean Goose Anser serrirostris. Low thousands were recorded in total, with the majority of these at Seosan and close to Gunsan and Saemangeum on 5th.\nGreater White-fronted Goose Anser albifrons. The most numerous goose encountered during the five days, with probably >10,000 scanned through in our search for Lesser White-fronted Goose.\nGreater White-fronted Goose \u00a9 Nial Moores\u2026A still unresolved taxonomic challenge.\nLesser White-fronted Goose Anser erythropus. VU. One First-winter and one adult were found in a flock of c. 2,500 Greater White-fronted in Gimje on 5th.\nBaikal Teal Sibirionetta formosa. It appears that very few birds reached Korea this winter (unless at sites largely unvisited by birders?). In addition to a couple of singles, we found only three thousand on the Geum River on the 4th (including one leucistic bird) and 4-5 on a small pond near to Kimje on 5th.\nCommon Pochard Aythya ferina. VU. At least 450 were on the Han River near Paldang on the 1st; and several hundred were on the Geum River on 4th.\nLesser Scaup Aythya affinis (?) A possible male was out on the Geum River on 4th, in a mixed flock of >1,000 Tufted Duck and Common Pochard. Unfortunately distance and a lack of time prevented us from studying or photographing the bird properly. In brief long-range views, the bird was obviously smaller (~10%) than most of the surrounding Tufted Duck and even more so than a couple of Greater Scaup; the head was peaked, with a small rear \u201cbump\u201d; the bill looked strikingly pale; and there was a suggestion of vermiculations extending onto the flanks.\nScaly-sided Merganser Mergus squamatus. EN. At least five were seen at close range on the Han River on the 1st, including a female swimming alongside a male with neck flattened \u2013 before the male climbed on top, gripping her neck tightly with his highly-serrated bill.\nYellow-billed Loon Gavia adamsii. NT. One or two were seen off Geojin on 2nd, and five were seen off the same coast on 3rd (including three from land and two from the boat). Based on counts (of 32+) made last year just north of the inner border of Korea \u2013 about 20km north of Geojin- it seems that early March is the time to see this species in Korea.\nPterodroma sp (?) At dawn on the 2nd, NM \u2018scoped two birds from land that were flying at long range from shore off a headland at Yangyang. The first was watched for about 30 seconds flying north in almost calm conditions, with a sweeping, undulating flight, rising from the surface up to 5m or more, and then back again, before being joined by a second bird flying in an identical manner \u2013 unlike any other birds that day and unlike any typical species in Korean waters (though a similar flight to that seen several times in overwintering dark shearwaters in windy conditions \u2013 all of which are considered most likely to be Short-taileds). During views of a minute or more in total, the first bird was initially considered most likely to be an odd-flying gull (perhaps a Kittiwake), but as the bird progressed north into better light and was joined by a second identical-looking bird flying in the same way, the perhaps default ID shifted to Streaked Shearwater. However, the flight was strikingly \u201cwrong\u201d; and both looked much more slender and agile and narrower-winged than Streaked Shearwater. They were too distant to see much plumage detail, but at 70X zoom both had white underparts (ruling out Short-tailed Shearwater) and pale underwings framed darker, with dark ("

He was unarmed and wearing the combat fatigues of a low-ranking soldier. He has not yet been named.\n\u201cCurrently, there are no unusual signs in the North Korean military, but we are increasing our alertness against the possibility of North Korean provocations\u201d, a South Korean military official said.\nFive hours later, a US citizen, who has been identified as \u201cA\u201d by South Korean police, but is reported to be 58 years old and from Louisiana, attempted to cross into North Korea. He arrived in South Korea on Friday and was detained shortly before 10am local time after crossing the Civilian Control Line just south of the frontier.\nA villager spotted the man in an area of the border district of Yeoncheon that is out of bounds to non-military personnel and informed local authorities of his presence, Yonhap news reported.\nThe man has told South Korean police that he crossed the Civilian Control Line as he intended to enter North Korea for \u201cpolitical purposes\u201d.\nLocal police, the South Korean Army and officials of the National Intelligence Service are questioning the man to get a fuller picture of his motivations.\nThe man\u2019s actions come less than five months after the death of Otto Warmbier, a US student who was detained on a visit to North Korea in January 2016 and sentenced to 15 years in prison with hard labour for attempting to steal a propaganda poster from a hotel in Pyongyang.\nReleased in June after 17 months in the North, he died less than a week after arriving back in the US.

I got an early start, so I only had to share the lake with two other people. I really enjoyed the setting of the lake and the stunning scenery around it. I contemplated taking a known spur trail up and around the lake for some better views, but I was feeling a little beat as it was and I wanted to save some energy for the first day of our backpack, so I just walked along the lake, enjoyed its brilliant reflection and snapped pics with the trusty Iphone. The hike down was quick, as one might expect. However, there was about a ten minute delay to watch a small black bear go about its routine. I passed a lot of people hiking out, confirming the trail's reputation, as a popular one.

Williams and Stewart blended for 2,250 yards and 17 touchdowns. Even with their most straightforward initiatives, Double Challenge had been not able toward contribute the Panthers toward the playoffs as the Panthers completed 3rd within just the NFC South with an 8-8 history.*The aftermathA mix of injury, education variations and offensive philosophies introduced an stop towards the magical work of Double Difficulty just after the 2009 time. Williams and Stewart battled harm off and upon for the remainder of their period inside Carolina, and both of those gamers ultimately moved upon versus the Carolinas. There are other excellent duos inside Panthers record, yet none of them had been as dynamic or as enjoyment in direction of keep track of as DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart. It actually a embarrassment that we simply just acquired 2 finish seasons of Double Difficulty, simply because they ended up a person of the great duos inside of NFL background and completely 1 of the optimum enjoyment in direction of check https://www.carolinafanstore.com/Foz...aker_Jersey-94. It an even more substantial humiliation that the Panthers couldn develop the unwind of their roster in close proximity to them in direction of deliver a accurate work at a championship, yet inspite of that we will normally consist of fond recollections of looking at just one of the great duos do the job alongside one another in direction of crank out a little something unique. I won communicate also substantially around it, nonetheless of class they choked their playoff activity absent within common Panthers design for the reason that we can incorporate pleasant factors.*Of training course they performed 8-8 within 2009 considering the fact that they completed 12-4 within 2008 Quin Blanding Jersey, and absolutely everyone is aware the Panthers are not able to contain back again-in the direction of-back again successful seasons considering that it versus the laws or just about anything which includes that.

May. 25, 2009 03:00 |||EMAIL_ADDRESS||| South Gyeongsang Province police yesterday said former President Roh Moo-hyun took his own life by jumping off Owl Rock at Mount Bonghwa in Gimhae. They also confirmed what Roh did before his death by questioning his bodyguard, who accompanied Roh to the mountain.\nBased on information obtained from Roh\u0092s computer at home, police found that he began typing his \"last words\" at 5:21 a.m. Saturday on his PC in the living room on the first floor of his house.\nHe first typed, \u0093I`ve caused too much pain to those around me,\u0094 and saved the note for the first time at 5:26 a.m., five minutes after he began writing it. He then made revisions and saved the 14-line suicide note at 5:44 a.m. The file was saved on the desktop.\nHe called his bodyguard on duty immediately after saving his note and said, \u0093I`m going to take a walk.\u0094 The bodyguard waited for Roh at the front gate of his residence with standard security equipment.\nAt 5:50 a.m. Roh appeared in a casual suit and hiking shoes. His bodyguard said he sensed nothing unusual though he said Roh looked a little tired that morning. Roh walked slowly one to two meters ahead of the bodyguard and said little.\nAround 6:00 a.m., Roh entered the hiking path of the mountain and headed toward the peak. He then went down the mountain toward Owl Rock. He had climbed the same course several times last year, but this was his first time this year.\nTwo riot police at the guard post of the residence saw Roh standing atop Owl Rock commanding a view of his residence and Bongha field, and reported his location to security headquarters at the residence.\nWhen the bodyguard turned to look at the climber, Roh took two steps forward that his bodyguard interpreted as an attempt to turn away from the climber.\nBefore the bodyguard could take action, however, Roh threw himself from a rock 45 meters high around 6:45 a.m.<|endoftext|>I just run live.

On the high ground, manageable problems lend themselves to solution through the use of research \u00adbased theory and technique. In the swampy lowlands, problems are messy and confusing and incapable of technical solution. The irony of this situation is that the problems of the high ground tend to be relatively unimportant to individuals or society at large, however great their technical interest maybe, while in the swamp lay the problems of greatest human concern. The \u201cleader\u201d is confronted with a choice. Shall she remain on the high ground where she can solve relatively unimportant problems according to her standards of rigor, or shall she descend to the swamp of important problems where she cannot be rigorous in any way she knows how to describe.\nNearly all professional practitioners experience a version of the dilemma of rigor or relevance, and they respond to it in one of several ways. Some of them choose the swampy lowland, deliberately immersing themselves in confusing but critically important situations. When they are asked to describe their methods of inquiry, they speak of experience, trial and error, intuition, or muddling through. When teachers, social workers, or planners operate in this vein, they tend to be afflicted with a nagging sense of inferiority in relation to those who present themselves as models of technical rigor. When physicists or engineers do so, they tend to be troubled by the discrepancy between the technical rigor of the \u201chard\u201d zones of their practice and the apparent sloppiness of the \u201csoft\u201d ones.<|endoftext|>YOOSHIN, which boasts enormous project experiences and world-class technical skill, makes an every effort to realize \u201cGreen Growth\u201d by pursuing the Environment and Socially Sustainable Development (ESSD) approach.

Instead, continue on with the same paragraph.\nConclusions The Icing on the Cake Begin your conclusion with a sentence or two that specifically echoes your thesis\u2014but be careful to not simply repeat it. Now ask yourself \u201cWhat is the bigger picture of my paper?\u201d. Take the time to guide your reader back through your essay, showing them how all the parts fit together. Warning: Do not repeat what you have already said. The reader has already read your essay. Show them the bigger picture. Finish your essay reflecting on the consequences of your thesis. Try to arrive at a new, or bigger idea. Why is your original thesis still important? What greater affect will it have?\nExample Essays Here are two example essays to examine. The Finch Family Raising a family well is perhaps the most important, yet difficult, of tasks. The idea of a \u201cgood\u201d family is a major theme of Harper Lee\u2019s To Kill A Mockingbird. In this novel, the main character, Atticus, is faced with having to raise his children alone after the loss of his wife. Despite being criticized by the community of Maycomb for being an irresponsible father, Atticus creates one of the most stable and loving families in the novel. Atticus is being criticized by everyone, including his sister. He says, \u201cSister, I do the best I can with them\u201d (81). Some people believe he does do a great job with his children by letting them go out and do things the way they want. They truly learn something that way when and if they make a mistake.\nExample 2 Continued arguments are not abnormal.

The webinars saw a global and a regional Asian/Pacific (APAC) audience.\nAsked \u2018What is your current rate of fuel substitution?\u2019, one quarter of the global cement professionals responded \u2018Less the 20%\u2019. On the same question, more than three quarters of their APAC colleagues responded the same.\nHowever, looking ahead five years on what is the \u2018desired\u2019 substitution rate, there was a dramatic increase among the APAC producers, with 50% stating they would like to be in the 20-40% bracket, 26% would like to be in the 40-60% bracket, while 13% would like to be in the \u2018greater than 80%\u2019 bracket.\nIn a recent analysis of the global alternative fuels adoption in cement, FLSmidth pyro experts Mads Nielsen and Robert Krist concluded that countries such as South Korea and Japan have taken the lead in the region, with adoption rates similar to Europe. This is causing a second-wave of alternative fuel adoption as places move towards 100% substitution rates.\nIn November 2020, Korean Sungshin Cement announced the purchase of two new HOTDISC Combustion Devices from FLSmidth to replace coal with alternative fuel in their kiln lines 3 and 6. The first device is expected to be commissioned in mid-2021 and the second at the end of 2021. After a recent installation at SsangYong\u2019s Yeongwol and Donghae plants this will be HOTDISC number 3 and 4 on the Korean peninsula.\nAlthough there is no lack of available alternative fuels, FLSmidth says that China for instance, has traditionally had a relatively low substitution rate. However, driven by acute concerns over air quality and waste disposal in many Chinese cities, the Chinese government now pays much more attention to sustainability issues and the transition has picked up pace. Cement companies that burn municipal waste as an alternative fuel are not subject to the same stringent production limits (brought in by the government to tackle overcapacity in the industry) as plants that use only fossil fuels.\nThis regulatory-driven approach has resulted in a focus on low-cost systems for alternative fuels handling systems, mostly from local Indian suppliers.\nIndian cement producer Dalmia has previously announced its commitment to achieving 100% substitution rates by 2030. To realise the ambition, the equipment and design of Dalmia Cement\u2019s new line at Rajgangpur was specifically curated to maximise the potential for alternative fuels.<|endoftext|>This morning around 6 I woke up and in that wonderful half-sleep just before I get up and feel the pain in my back wrenching me back to reality I thought about how many times I started the college term in the Fall of every year for the past 36 years with the same lecture. It\u2019s about how I teach sociology and how my students learn and don\u2019t learn. I teach sociology, but right now I want to focus on the teaching part of what I do and not the sociology part. I\u2019ve also taught 1st year (freshman) French, Canadian HIstory, Anthropology and Sociology, but over the last 25 years or so, pretty much exclusively Sociology. So I know that my teaching style is consistent across various subjects. I teach using humour (at least I think I\u2019m funny at least some of the time) and a highly critical approach to things. After teaching for so long I know that some of my students, at least, appreciate my teaching style. Funny thing is, I don\u2019t think I can teach people how to teach like I do. It\u2019s not a teachable skill. It\u2019s a skill that comes from a confluence of life happenings, genetics, upbringing and experience. To know when to chide a student or make a joke or criticize the textbook is something I\u2019ve learned over the years. Most of the time, it works. I don\u2019t use notes when I teach. Teaching for me is a dialogue between me, the text writers and my students. I don\u2019t think I could learn that at teacher\u2019s college. It depends on my personality as much as my knowledge. It helps that I love what I do, that I have a deep connection to what I know and study and that I have respect for my students and their struggles. Every year, with a new set of fresh students, I tell them that every one of them has the intelligence to make it through my course and do well.\nBut, I tell them, there are many reasons they might not do well. Personal troubles are at the top of the list. Disputes with family, friends and/or lovers can really sap energy and impair concentration. Struggles with beliefs, with what\u2019s right or wrong, good and bad although sometimes essential for learning can leave one confused and disoriented just at a time when there is a real need for concentrated activity in studying and listening in class. Overwhelming concern with what others\u2019 expectations are, whether articulated or not, push away the need to work on course material. Worry about work, finances, children, husbands, wives, parents and health all contribute to poor academic performance. This is fodder for another blog post in the near future, but for now, I just want to convey the reality that success in school is not just a result of hard work, nor is it the achievement of"

I remember everything that you said to me\".\nAnd that's so true until he can even create a dictionary to list the new words he heard she mentioned in front of him.\nKim Jung Hyun was not an actor that I particularly liked, but he is doing a great job in this drama and I will definitely continue see his work from now on. I can't say anything about Shin Hye Sun, she's always wonderful. I also read somewhere that drama is boring, I think everyone has their opinion, however they criticize the actors harshly, it's so sad.\nI am watching kdramas for almost 10 years and always was a silent soompi reader. But this drama made me sign up. As long as it makes me smile who cares what others think since i am here now, i want to write some.\nI think the best ending is so yong and bong hwan having the same soul. Then so yong can have both memory of past and future life. that means the future bong hwan can wake up and keep on his life.\nIf it is not, then i prefer the ending game as so yong and the king. Why?\nBecause bong hwan is a straight guy. \nThe show try to show us the feelings so bong has belongs to so yong. When they kissed it was so yong. They made it clear when she opened her eyes. Thats why he slapped her.\n What about bong hwan? When the king learn the truth of past, he will be a fake so young, too. He is not the one who saved the king. I do not want so yong being disappear, She deserves to be remembered by the ones she loved.\nThen, Bong hwan should go back to his life and take his revenge, fall in love and have his happy ending.\nWhat I think would work here is the merging of the 2 souls. If BH voluntarily gave up his memories from the future in order to stay with Cheoljong as Soyong (after having solved his issues in the future by doing something to Han in the past) that would make SY/BH one person and the story could work. Cheoljong wouldn\u2019t be staying with a fake SY, he\u2019d partially end up with the real SY who would be a combination of BH\u2019s personality and SY\u2019s personality, feelings, memories and body. Technically, BongHwan is in a vegetative state, so his life in the future can end any minute, and staying alive through SY is like a second life opportunity for him. Maybe the story will make him realize that he wasted his first life on superficial things and he\u2019s been given this life in Joseon as a 2nd chance to live in a different way? If he gives up his memories VOLUNTARILY he could adapt to Joseon and love Cheoljong without any problem. That\u2019s the most convincing solution I can think of.\nOMG. What a complicated story. It's funny because it's crazy but I kind of like not knowing how the writer will solve it.\n@Iceblue Hi and welcome to the thread!\nFor modesty's sake we will not be invited. Instead we will watch the royal chef craft a lady-in-waiting doll from bark and pine cones as a gift for his favorite lady while muttering about overbearing queens.\nHey I'm new But this drama is so amazing I needed somewhere to go and talk about it!!!\nFrom what I seen SY soul is gone, just her memories and feelings linger in her body, at least that what I get it's not like BH blacks out when he becomes attracted to the king or has a flash he seems to remain himself but just becomes consumed by her emotions or her memories even when he was kissing the king he tried to dominate him, if that was so young soul I don't think she would have done that from what we've seen she didn't seem like that type of person, but maybe she was. Also, when he returned to his vegetated body she did not return to her so either her soul is stuck somewhere or she's generally gone. At least that's what I gathered from my observation, it kinda like those drama's with heart transplant.\nHi @Some1ran and welcome to the thread!\nthinking about the part where she mumbled something like \"why? u always wanted a daughter..\" something lidat.. when she was in a vegetative state which prompted the king to say, \"yeah u missed your mom bla bla..\"\nSHS has a very cute face, so i sort of associated her with being petite but she's actually so tall! she's like almost the same height with KJH.. but yeah, she is an actress..\nYes, thank you soo much @selen4ever!\nPeoples can say whatever they want about this drama or Shin Hye Sun/Kim Jung Hyun pair here, but many drama productions can see queen Shin Hye Sun talent from this drama and her past dramas.\nThat's why they want her to work with them.\nI'm so happy for you, my queen!\nI'm sure it is the same with king Kim Jung Hyun and I'm wondering what kind of character he will tackle next. Since I don't know Korean language, I'm also rely the news about his drama through translation.\nI'm eagerly waiting for the news of his next drama. Fighting!\nI fall for him since School 2017 and I love him more here as the multilayer character, King Cheol Jong. His character is quiet, people think that is boring but in his head, he's like \"I'm willing to look dumb since right now I'm execute my plan about the way to kick yo a**\"\nAs I mentioned on my post before, with all the chaos in the real world, why we have to focus about people comments that only added our stress?\nI love Mr Queen, I love the royal couple, I really love Shin Hye Sun and Kim Jung Hyun performances and chemistry together here so let's enjoy this drama together, ok friends!\nI'm so glad that both of them get to work together in this drama! They are my happy pills!\nFighting Mr Queen!\nI just did some history backgroud of Queen Cheorin.\nShe was the daughter of Kim Mun-geun (Hangul: \uae40\ubb38\uadfc, Hanja: \u91d1\u6c76\u6839) and his second wife, Lady Heung-yang of the Yeoheung Min clan (Hangul: \ud765\uc591\ubd80\ubd80\uc778 \uc5ec\ud765 \ubbfc\uc528, Hanja: \u8208\u967d\u5e9c\u592b\u4eba \u9a6a\u8208 \u9594\u6c0f). As part of the Andong Kim clan's manipulation of King Cheoljong, she married Cheoljong in 1851.\nlove the tension of loving your legit wife and yet she's the one you can't have. just waiting for all the tension to explode like fireworks!\nWhat if the king is a woman in the modern time and so yong is bong hwan?

Because the ROCE was poor, the major fiscal problem was that the energy business is not competitive as an investment vehicle compared with other growth industries (such as computing, the Internet, and biomedicine). When the economics of time-lapse (4D) reservoir management are considered in a stochastic portfolio model of future cash now, various price scenarios can be considered quantitatively in terms of the relative contributions of each large field to the company's overall success. High recovery rates are required to balance risk and reward sufficiently. However, if cost-cutting models are used that exclude 4D reservoir management from future development scenarios for these fields, cash-now shortfalls result in all but the most optimistic future-price scenarios.<|endoftext|>\"Paradox Box\" seems easy at first.

To counter those tactics, the Pentagon since 2001 has been arming unmanned aerial vehicles to identify and destroy targets with missiles. The Defense Department is seeking weapons for UAVs that can strike enemies but limit collateral damage, especially in cities.\nThe Army\u2019s solution is the Autonomous Rotorcraft Sniper System (ARSS), a small, unmanned helicopter equipped with a powerful.338-caliber rifle. An autopilot system handles the tricky business of flying while the operator lines up the kill shot on a remote monitor.\nThe Army ground-tested the rifle\u2019s turret on a Vigilante unmanned helicopter to evaluate its accuracy. The turret-control hardware and flight-control algorithms will be refined to make shots more accurate before airborne testing begins in July. The program\u2019s heads say the airborne robo-sniper idea was put forward five years ago, but only became practical when Utah State University\u2019s Space Dynamics Laboratory designed a lightweight, stabilized turret. Users control it with an adapted Xbox 360 controller. The same turret could be used on unmanned fixed-wing aircraft such as the Predator or Reaper and could also allow ground robots to fire on the move.\nNote the \"Adapted Xbox 360 Game Console\" controller and there's a picture on the PM site.\nAlso note they want to \"Limit collateral damage\" (natch) - that ever-useful euphemism for those 'pain-in-the-arse innocent bystanders' (to use a favourite of mine from 'The Godfather') that they keep blowing to bits at a ratio in excess of 20:1 goodies:baddies or more.\nSurreal isn't it?\nTerminator 3 - Rise of the Machines.\nI make the sad prognostication it will NOT be long before we hear of an armed one firing on someone - some house or car in the USA not too far into the future.....they keep rachetting it up in one direction and the sheeple accept all the past horrors and only are agape at the last one...to accept it when supassed by new horrors.....just like in Germany in the later 30's...\nHere's my favorite drone story, although there's plenty of them around these days.\nA drone attack targeting a couple of Taliban leaders in the morning kills around 8 people. It appears the targets got away but it's hard to get a proper reading of the situation because journalists and other media types are barred from the conflict zones. In the afternoon a funeral gathering for those killed earlier is again attacked by drones, killing many more civilians.

Many pregnancy tests have a certain time frame they should be left to sit before they can be read accurately. This time frame can range from one to five minutes. If you don\u2019t wait the right amount of time, you may not get an accurate result.\nThe amount of time you should wait for the pregnancy test to sit will depend on the test you\u2019re using. Most tests come with instructions that detail how much time should be allowed to pass before you test. Generally, it\u2019s best to follow the instructions that come on the test you\u2019re using.\nTest type: Different types of pregnancy tests require different wait times.\nTesting environment: Some testing environments can affect the wait time of a test.\nTest sensitivity: Tests with higher sensitivity may require a longer wait time.\nRead the instructions carefully and make sure you understand the wait time.\nFollow the recommended wait time.\nDo not switch between different tests if you\u2019re uncertain.\nCheck the expiration date of the test before using it.\nUse a timer or watch to keep track of the time.\nWaiting can be difficult, especially when pregnant. However, it\u2019s important to take the time to wait for results. This can help ensure more accurate results so you can make informed decisions about your pregnancy.\nKnowing how long to let a pregnancy test sit is important for getting an accurate result. Different tests require different wait times, so make sure you follow the instructions carefully. In some cases, tests with higher sensitivity may require a longer wait time. If you need help with determining how long to wait, consult with your healthcare provider.<|endoftext|>Joop Homme Wild eau de toilette spray for men is described as a woody and sweet perfume, opening with top notes of pink pepper, which then blends into a heart of rum, all of which is finally rounded off with a smooth base of white tobacco and woody accords.\nHere at Fragrance Direct we have a wonderful selection of Joop perfumes and toiletries in stock, and this Joop Homme Wild eau de toilette spray for men is proving a firm favourite amongst our customers for its seductive yet masculine aroma.<|endoftext|>2600 pcs. available max.\nThis type B quick release connector can be used to make a right angle connection between two aluminum profiles.

Kathy Garcia, his manager, and co-trainers Max and Sam Garcia, refuse to share responsibility for the health and welfare of a boxer who won\u201dt be responsible for himself. Unprepared fighters can be badly hurt, or even killed, in the ring, and the Garcias won\u201dt back a boxer they cannot fully trust to respect the very real danger of the profession.\nPerez also will be under suspension by the Missouri State Boxing Commission (a ruling he has a right to appeal),and commissions in other states also could choose to suspend his boxing license.\nCEO Richard Schaefer of Golden Boy Promotions expressed concern over Perez\u201ds health, and wished him well, but notably made no statement about the fighter\u201ds five-year contract with the company. On the one hand, Golden Boy Promotions couldn\u201dt be blamed for terminating the agreement, especially in the wake of Perez\u201ds dismal showing against Broner. On the other, Golden Boy\u201ds public face, Oscar De La Hoya, has infamously battled cocaine issues of his own, and therefore may prove to be uniquely tolerant of this misstep.\nBut this story isn\u201dt merely about Eloy Perez \u2014 a point the fighter, himself, apparently failed to appreciate.\nA worldwide HBO audience saw some very real tears roll down Perez\u201ds cheeks as he recounted how his father, Eloy Sr., gave up a teaching career in Mexico to become a dirt-poor laborer in the U.S. and hopefully build a better future for his family. Perez remembered the holes in the floorboard of the dilapidated trailer that was their first family home in U.S. He spoke of the joy he felt when his boxing paychecks enabled him to allow his father retire.\nThe Perez family is a good one, a loving one. His parents and younger sister beamed with pride three weeks ago as they watched Eloy get the star treatment during the week leading up to the Broner fight.\nEloy\u201ds parents and sister were in St. Louis all expenses paid by the Garcias, who picked up the full tab for their airfare, their four-star hotel accommodations, their ringside seats.\nIndeed, the Garcias probably rank among the most-philanthropic people in the history of professional boxing, whose history is filthy with tales of managers who squeezed every dime out of their fighters, then, when those fighters could no longer produce, cast them aside like yesterday\u201ds garbage.\nThe amazing truth is that no boxer who has ever been trained and managed by Garcia Boxing has ever been asked for a penny in return until his payday reached the six-digit pinnacle. (Eloy\u201ds purse for the Broner fight was the first to reach that level.) The Garcias take nothing from their fighter\u201ds purses for training, management, dietary supervision from a professional nutritionist, a professional publicist, equipment or expenses.\nIn fact, the Garcias \u2014 who aren\u201dt wealthy people \u2014 dip into their own pockets to cover all training costs (including those at out-of-town venues such as Big Bear Lake), all sparring partners, all meals, all airfare and lodging. Perez and other fighters have actually lived rent-free in their modest Salinas home for months at a time.\nAll they expect (and demand) in return is total dedication to the sport, and respect for the reality that a fighter puts himself at mortal risk if he steps into the ring unprepared.\nIf Perez did, in fact, ingest cocaine before he fought Broner, how can he be trusted with that enormous responsibility? The Garcias are loving, forgiving, endlessly generous people. They\u201dve proved that by maintaining strong friendships with fighters they previously cut adrift for choosing to walk a reckless path. What they refuse to be isenablers.\nMeanwhile, the Garcias have declined to comment publicly about Perez\u201ds situation, other than confirm that he has been unconditionally released from all contractual obligations. They\u201dve made no on-the-record revelations about the results of the drug test"

Fruits of four species, namely Autumn sense (A), Chungsan (C), Daesung (D), and Green ball (Gb) were collected from five different areas of Gwangyang (G), Muju (M), Suwon (S), Wonju (Q), and Yeongwol (Y) in South Korea. The dataset for calibration and prediction was prepared based on each area, species, and in combination. Half of the dataset of each area, species, and combined dataset was used as calibrated data and the rest was used for model validation. The best prediction correlation coefficient ranges between 0.67 and 0.75, 0.61 and 0.77, and 0.68 for the area, species, combined dataset, respectively using partial least square regression (PLSR) method with different preprocessing techniques. On the other hand, the best correlation coefficient of predictions using the support vector machine regression (SVM-R) algorithm was 0.68 and 0.80, 0.62 and 0.79, and 0.74 for the area, species, and combined dataset, respectively. In most cases, the SVM-R algorithm produced better results with Autoscale preprocessing except G area and species Gb, whereas the PLS algorithm shows a significant difference in calibration and prediction models for different preprocessing techniques. Therefore, the SVM-R method was superior to the PLSR method in predicting soluble solids content of hardy kiwi fruits and non-linear models may be a better alternative to monitor soluble solids content of fruits. The finding of this research can be used as a reference for the prediction of hardy kiwi fruits soluble solids content as well as harvesting time with better prediction models.\n\n\nIntroduction\nFruits are manually or mechanically sorted based on size, color, shape, and surface defects, while internal quality parameters including soluble solids content (SSC), acidity (pH), vitamins, and phytochemicals are generally determined by destructive approach [1]. Regarding kiwi fruit production, the determination of internal quality attributes is a paramount concern to consume quality fruits. In recent years, the improvement of non-destructive technology has gained much attention for the application in measuring food quality, which is easy in operation, fast, and reliable than traditional methods [2]. Visible/near-infrared (Vis/NIR) spectroscopy is one of the promising nondestructive spaces efficiently, to manage noisy patterns and multi-modal class distributions, and their restriction on a subset of training data to suit a non-linear function [32].\nStudies carried out on hardy kiwi fruit with NIRS include heavy, equipped, complex, and lab-based NIR systems. Hence, a portable, user-friendly, and handheld NIR spectrophotometer is highly capable of in situ measurements that will help kiwi growers to check the pre-harvest maturity level and internal fruit attributes in a non-destructive way [33]. Based on the above discussion, this research was designed with an aim to compare the results of two different analyzing procedures PLSR and SVM-R with various preprocessing techniques for the prediction of SSC of hardy kiwi fruit from NIR spectra acquired using a portable handheld spectrometer.\n\nSample Preparation\nThe hardy kiwi fruit (Actinidia arguta) was used in this study and collected from ten different farms of five regions in South Korea. Table 1 shows the location of each farm in five areas as follows: In this study, hardy kiwi samples were collected from five areas (Gwangyang, Muju, Suwon, Wonju and Yeongwol) which include four species, namely, Autumn sense, Chungsan, Daesung, and Green ball. All samples were subjected to a post-ripening process under same environmental conditions of temperature (20\u00b0C), and relative humidity (65%) for three days. Datasets were prepared based on area, species, and in combination. Area dataset includes samples data of each area, species dataset includes different farms data, and combine dataset includes all data together. The classified dataset of each area, species, and combine set are presented in Table 2. Afterward, datasets were divided into two groups equally for each area, species, and combine set: the first group was used to develop the calibration models and the other for predicting quality and model validation purposes.\nA number of factors, such as geographical origin, temperature, season, cultivar, and fruit maturity affect the fruit cellular and optical structure as well as chemical composition and fruit internal quality parameters, such as SSC, moisture, and acidity [34]. Therefore, to establish a more reliable and robust model for the prediction of SSC, biological and physical changes in samples on the NIR spectrum should be considered. In this study, one approach was applied to develop models using individual area data. The individual area or origin model indicates more reliable prediction ability if the predicted samples were collected from the same area [35]. Furthermore, a prediction model depending on a variety or species is more appropriate than the multiple species [36]. On the contrary, multiple species or varieties-dependent dataset gives a more accurate and robust prediction model for the determination of harvesting time or fruit maturity [37]. By considering all these integrities, datasets and the models were developed for each area, each species, and in combination.\n\nSpectra Acquisition\nIn this experiment, spectra acquisition was based on interactance mode; each sample was scanned using a portable, handheld, and low precision near-infrared spectrophotometer (F-750 produce quality meter, Felix Instruments, Inc., 1554 NE 3rd Avenue Camas, WA, USA). The Vis/NIR spectrophotometer scans four times simultaneously to produce one average absorbance spectra by log (1/R reflectance) of the intact fruit between the wavelengths of 310 and 1100 nm at a data resolution of 3 nm, spectral resolution ranging from 8 to 13 nm. Xenon tungsten light source was used in this instrument to illuminate the fruit through a sampling window of 30 mm diameter. The device equipped with a Zeiss MMS1 VIS-NIR spectrometer (Carl-Zeiss-Promenade 1,007,745 Jena, Germany) placed just behind the sampling window to incorporate the light transmitted through the skin and flesh of the fruit. Furthermore, absorbance spectra were converted to second derivative spectra using F750 Data viewer (Felix Instruments, Inc., 1554 NE 3rd Avenue Camas, WA, USA) software, and spectra from 729-975 nm were analyzed while 310 to 728 nm and beyond 975 nm were eliminated because of the noise containing in this wavelength regions.\n\nReference Measurement\nReference measurement of SSC of hardy kiwi is the primary internal quality attribute that was measured using a portable digital refractometer (SCM-1000, HM Digital Inc. 2629 Manhattan Beach Blvd. Redondo Beach, CA 90,278 USA) with a measurement range of 0-55%brix destructively after spectra acquisition with the spectrophotometer.\n\nChemometrics\nThe most important chemical ingredient of fruits and vegetables is water which absorbs near-infrared radiation [38], and near-infrared spectrum consist of a large set of overtones and combination bands which are convoluted because of the complicated chemical composition of typical fruits and vegetables [20]. In addition, spectrums can be convoluted by complicated wavelength-dependent scattering effects, tissue heterogeneities, instrumental noise, ambient effects, and other sources of variability [39]. Therefore, chemometrics would be the compatible solution to extract as much information from the interpretive NIRS data [26].\n\nSpectral Data Preprocessing\nThe spectra data obtained from the spectrometer consist of background information and noise other than sample information, and it is very decisive to pre-process spectra data before modeling to obtain reliable, accurate, and steady calibration models [39]. Spectral preprocessing techniques are required to remove any irrelevant information, including noise, uncertainties, variability, interactions, and Foods 2020, 9, 1078 5 of 23 unrecognized features. In this study, original spectra were converted to second derivative preprocessing (SD), later several preprocessing methods such as normalization-multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), standard normal variate transformation (SNV), orthogonal signal correction (OSC), Autoscale, and combination of normalization preprocessing techniques were applied on second derivative spectra data to build calibration and prediction models. Second derivative preprocessing was used to remove background and increase spectral resolution and to remove slope"

It\u2019s the moment when a devotee glances at his place of worship, his spiritual guide for the first time. It\u2019s the moment when a thing of beauty comes to life in front of your eyes \u2013 like watching evolution give shape to the world, or looking into your firstborn\u2019s eyes moments after birth. I had a similar experience on Saturday night when I visited the shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in Sehwan.\nIt involved neither God nor evolution, but rather something more powerful that abides within us: love and peace. I have lived over two decades with the mind of a cynic, questioning and making sense of the nonsense around me and it has only happened a few times that I stop and just feel things as they are, without any judgment. It happened when I was kayaking in a lake surrounded by mountains in Yeongwol, South Korea. It happened in the mountainous Buddhist temple of Naksan where Buddha\u2019s spirit lived in the winter fog and watched over his devotees. And it happened again in the ethereal presence of Qalandar.\nA courtyard full of devotees who did not care that just over a week ago, a suicide blast had killed 88 people in that very place. I was there, moving to the rhythm of Lal, whose four lamps never extinguish. I was there to light the fifth one.\nWatching people go into a trance to the sound of dhamaal was a moving experience. What followed was a peace jam by Sounds of Kolachi and percussionist Abdul Aziz Qazi, marking the first time any band has performed inside the Qalandar shrine.\nThe heart-touching sound of Gul Muhammad\u2019s sarangi combined with Ahsan Bari\u2019s guitar, Qazi\u2019s caj\u00f3n, and Ahmed\u2019s vocals served as a call, an azaan of sorts. In no time, people gathered around to witness the manifestation of a peaceful gesture in the face of fear that had swallowed the world. In fact, it occurred to me that, apart from the tighter security at the entrance, the public did not even worry about the blast anymore. The power of peace had set into them so heavily that it wasn\u2019t going to stop them from visiting the pilgrimage site.\nEach musical note and each expression of the people in witness exclaimed, \u201cNo blasts or killings can conquer peace and love.\u201d The shrine was a canal, where musicians took inspiration from the people and gave them back through music \u2013 an ecosystem, a cycle of peace. It\u2019s even more interesting that no person objected to it. Music was a whole another prayer, similar to what the regular devotees did at the shrine. To top it, two local musicians joined in with nagaras of their own \u2013 like dervishes joining a group of dervishes in the dance of zikr.\nIt talks about love and mental peace where nothing, no worldly chatter and noise can touch you. One of the most important sutras in Buddhism, it talks of \u201cBodhi\u201d, which is awakening. If the entire experience of Qalandar\u2019s shrine can be summed up in one word, it\u2019s awakening.<|endoftext|>Neon Light - China Neon Light Manufacturers, Products...\nNeon Light directory, provide China Neon Light manufacturers, products and suppliers from China for worldwide Neon Light purchasers.\nNeon Light Instal Suppliers, all Quality Neon Light Instal...\nWholesale Solar Powered Neon Lights - Buy Cheap in Bulk...\nFor years, DHgate has been holding the title of one of the most affordable wholesale marketplace, bringing the highest-quality solar lightfrom China.

If you missed my first post, read it!\nThere has been a lot of interest lately in the daily ritual of artists and writers. I think it is a bit of a mystery how creative types manage to discipline themselves enough day after day to actually get their work done, while also indulging their creative whims that help fuel the work they do. And making your way in the world as an artist, which means doing your own thing on your own terms, takes lots of discipline and self-control.\nAll of us want to be in the studio, but many of us have a hard time getting in there consistently and as I pointed out in my last post, consistency is key to running a successful creative business. So many things to do to prepare ourselves properly before we step into our creative space, so many cute cat pics to look at first. The way to address this problem is with a daily ritual that will help you transition into your studio smoothly and without fuss, day after day.\nOne, it sets a daily pattern that alerts your brain to the fact that we are going to do some familiar and routine things, and then we are going to the studio. You're brain doesn't have as much of a chance to dream up exciting capers and out-of-studio adventures because you've given it notice that we are not doing that today, we're going to the studio and focusing on work.\nTwo, a daily routine eliminates the need to make decisions about petty things and uses that brain power for more important things. \nThree, the daily ritual is a weapon against procrastination. You're set with a routine that meets your needs, and over time it becomes a well-worn path that is easier and easier to follow. \nThe daily ritual is all about transition-- transition from the your regular life to your creative life in the studio. You start developing your daily ritual by looking at what time of day and from what place you transition to your studio. For me, I'm transitioning from my home in the morning to my studio to work all day. So my daily ritual encompasses an everyday morning routine-- personal hygiene, exercise, meditation, breakfast, computer time, etc. I include all of these things in my daily ritual because once I'm in my studio, I don't want to be distracted by anything such as needing to get exercise, racing thoughts, anxiety about responding to a customer, or feeling hungry. I've dealt with all of that stuff already and I don't have to think about it anymore.\nthat brings you comfort while addressing the things that may distract you once you are in the studio, so you can walk into the studio ready to focus. It must be something that you can look forward to so you don't mind doing it day after day. If your life is very chaotic with a lot of elements you can't always control, your daily ritual can be as simple as a cup of tea before doing your work. Or it can be very elaborate like mine, covering all of your basic needs.\nI developed my daily ritual by making a detailed list of everything my most ideal self would do every day to make a perfect morning. It's true that things don't always go as planned and there are interruptions that throw my day off. But for the most part, my daily rituals sees to all of my needs and protects me from the chaos of my own mind. I would love to hear from you about your daily ritual, or struggles you have while trying to establish one.\nMy next post in this series will cover more of the nitty-gritty on how I divide my time up between all my tasks, how I streamline things, and how I keep a lid on the chaos.<|endoftext|>Face masks on Muppets!

        "passage": " from home, we can also get quick, detailed answers on how to fix problems through social media.\nOutside of simply asking knowledgable friends how to fix something through a Facebook post, I recommend using one of the many subreddits dedicated to Apple products on Reddit. The most obvious one is r/applehelp, which serves as the Reddit counterpart of Apple\u2019s Support Communities page. Elsewhere, some of the more common subreddits for specific Apple products include those for the iPhone and Mac, but keep in mind that the iPhone subreddit prohibits support questions unless they\u2019re in the \u201cDaily Tech Support Thread\u201d at the top of the feed. If you\u2019re on any of the other subreddits, run a search out of courtesy to make sure your question hasn\u2019t already been asked and answered before.\nA glimpse at what you can expect to find on the r/applehelp subreddit.\nTwitter is also helpful\u2014especially if you use Advanced Search\u2014but to a lesser degree. Typically when I\u2019m looking for possible leads for a solution to a tech-related problem, I\u2019ll just plunk a few words into the search bar and then sort the results by \u201clatest\u201d if I don\u2019t see what I need at first. The problem with Twitter compared to Reddit or the Apple Support Communities, though, is that you\u2019ll often see questions from folks having the same issues as you\u2014but with no answers.\nSometimes just seeing a fix in action is more helpful than reading the most detailed text-based how-to, and that\u2019s where YouTube comes in handy. We have our own library of helpful how-tos and support videos on the Macworld YouTube channel, but there\u2019s also a good chance you\u2019ll find a helpful video for your issue through a simple search of the whole site.\nJust keep in mind that the quality varies. Some otherwise helpful videos have unnecessarily long introductions that drag on for minutes before giving you the information you\u2019re after. Some videos leave out crucial steps, and some of the best videos are based on outdated builds of iOS or macOS\u2014so be sure to check when the video was posted. Unlike with a text article, you can\u2019t simply update a video on YouTube with the new information.\nAs helpful as the internet is, it can\u2019t fix everything. Sometimes your iPhone\u2019s volume buttons won\u2019t work, and sometimes your MacBook is just dead. That means your next-best option will be to set up an appointment at the local Apple Store, and I can confirm that the one in Union Square here in San Francisco is at least scrubbing down surfaces and providing hand sanitizer.\nApple Stores tend to be crowded places.\nIf you don\u2019t want to take that risk, though, Apple will often let you mail your defective product to an Apple Repair Center, even if you live in a place like the Bay Area where it\u2019s easy to find either an Apple Store or an Authorized Service Provider. According to an Apple representative I spoke to, this option is usually available depending on the nature of the problem and your location.\nTo see if you qualify, start the process through the Apple Repair site by clicking Start a repair request toward the bottom of the page.<|endoftext|>The Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi, has sworn in new members of the Revenue Appeal Commission, Secondary Education Board, and Universal Basic Education Board.\nThe swearing-in ceremony took place at the Executive Council Chambers, Ochoudo Centenary City Abakaliki on Tuesday.\nThis was disclosed in a statement issued by the Special Assistant to the Governor on Media on Publicity, Francis Nwaeze on Wednesday.\nAddressing the Appointees, Umahi who spoke through the Honourable Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Chief Cletus Ofoke charged the appointees not to see their appointment as political patronage but a call to service for the continued transformation of the State.\nThe new members of the Revenue Appeal Commission included Honourable Ikechukwu Nwankwo, Mrs Sharon Umahi, Pastor Moses Anasi, Honourable Emmanuel Aleke, Princess Elemanya Ebila, and Sunday Joseph Nwonumaru.\nFor the Secondary Education Board, the appointees are Mr David Egbu, Honourable Ikechukwu Ogbu, Mr Sylvester Awam, Honourable Donatus Aja, and Dr Chukwemeka Okpara.\nThose appointed to the Board of State Universal Basic Education are Chief Sabinus Nwankwegu, Mrs Lucy Ofefe, Dr Gabriel Udu, Comrade Leonard Nkah, Princess Kate Elebe, Mr Nathaniel Matuh, Mrs. Grace Ngwu, Mrs Eucheria Offia Nwali, Mrs Adaeze Akochi, and Mrs Nnenna Otuonye.\nEarlier, the Honourable Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Chief Cletus Ofoke said the appointments followed due process and were necessary to fill vacancies in the Boards and Commission.\nOn behalf of the appointees, the Secretary of Revenue Appeal Commission, Right Honourable Ikechukwu Nwankwo thanked the Governor for finding them worthy to serve and assured of their determination to deliver on their assignment.<|endoftext|>Pretty cool news!

The helicity amplitudes of the electroexcitation of the Roper resonance on proton are extracted at 1.7 < Q 2 < 4.2 GeV 2 from recent high precision JLab-CLAS cross sections data and longitudinally polarized beam asymmetry for \u03c0 + electroproduction on protons. The analysis is made using two approaches, dispersion relations and unitary isobar model, which give consistent results. It is found that the transverse helicity amplitude for the \u03b3 * p \u2192 P11(1440) transition, which is large and negative at Q 2 = 0, becomes large and positive at Q 2 \u2243 2 GeV 2, and then drops slowly with Q 2. Longitudinal helicity amplitude, that was previously found from CLAS data as large and positive at Q 2 = 0.4, 0.65 GeV 2, drops with Q 2. These results rule out the presentation of P11(1440) as a q 3 G hybrid state, and provide strong evidence in favor of this resonance as a first radial excitation of the 3q ground state.\nPACS. 1 1.55.Fv, 13.60.Le, 13.40. Gp,14.20.Gk In this talk we report our results on the electroexcitation of the Roper resonance (P 11 (1440)) extracted from a large body of CLAS data on differential cross sections and polarized beam asymmetries for the process ep \u2192 en\u03c0 + in the range of invariant hadronic mass W = 1.15\u22121.69 GeV and photon virtuality Q 2 = 1.7 \u2212 4.2 GeV 2 with full azimuthal and polar angle coverage [1]. Combined with the information obtained from the previous CLAS data at Q 2 = 0.4, 0.65 GeV 2 [2,3] and that at Q 2 = 0 [4], these results give us knowledge of the Roper electroexcitation in wide Q 2 range and allow us to draw quite definite conclusions on the nature of P 11 (1440).\nIt is known that the structure of the Roper resonance has attracted special attention since its discovery, because the simplest and most natural assumption that this is a first radial excitation of the 3q ground state led to the difficulties in the description of the resonance. To deal with shortcomings of the quark model, alternative, as well extended descriptions of P 11 (1440) were developed: as a hybrid (q 3 G) state [5,6], that of a quark core dressed by a meson cloud [7,8], a dynamically generated \u03c0N resonance [9], and presentations that include 3q \u2212 qq components, in particular, strong \u03c3N component (see Ref. [10] and references therein).\nThe Q 2 dependence of the electromagnetic transition form factors is highly sensitive to different descriptions of the Roper state. However, until recently, the data base needed to measure these form factors at relatively high Q 2 was almost exclusively based on \u03c0 0 production, and was very limited in kinematical coverage. Also, the \u03c0 0 p final state is dominated by the nearby isospin 3/2 \u2206(1232) resonance, whereas the isospin 1/2 Roper state couples more strongly to the \u03c0 + n channel. The data [1] allow us to extract the \u03b3 * p \u2192 P 11 (1440) helicity amplitudes at Q 2 = 1.7 \u2212 4.2 GeV 2, and therefore to obtain complete picture of the electroexcitation of the Roper resonance in a wide Q 2 region.\nThe approaches we use are fixed-t dispersion relations (DR) and unitary isobar model (UIM), which both were successfully employed in Refs. [2,3,11] to analyze photoproduction and low Q 2 electroproduction of pions. These approaches were presented and discussed in Refs. [11].\nThe imaginary parts of the amplitudes in both approaches are determined mainly by s-channel resonance contributions which we parameterize in the Breit-Wigner form with energy-dependent widths [11,12]. The exception was made for the P 33 (1232) resonance which was treated in a special way. According to the phase-shift analyses"

Morphometric approaches of using the landmark and principal component analyses make it possible to differentiate P. sinicus from P. atavus with clarity: pygidia of P. sinicus have a relatively narrow M1, a transverse F2, and a weakly developed M2 tubercle, whereas those of P. atavus are characterized by a broadly arching M1, a chevron-shaped F2, and a prominent M2 tubercle. Recognition of P. atavus, for the first time in Korea, allows the determination of the base of the Drumian Stage in Korea and aids correlation with other parts of the world.<|endoftext|>Since at least May 2017, threat actors have targeted government entities and the energy, water, aviation, nuclear, and critical manufacturing sectors, and, in some cases, have leveraged their capabilities to compromise victims\u2019 networks.<|endoftext|>\ufeffusing System;\nusing System.IO;\nusing Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Text;\nusing Newtonsoft.Json;\n\nnamespace SourceExpander\n{\n    internal static partial class JsonUtil\n    {\n        public static JsonConverterCollection Converters { get; } = new();\n\n        public static string ToJson<T>(T infos)\n            => JsonConvert.SerializeObject(infos, new JsonSerializerSettings\n            {\n                Converters = Converters,\n                Formatting = Formatting.None,\n                StringEscapeHandling = StringEscapeHandling.Default,\n            });\n\n        public static T ParseJson<T>(SourceText jsonText) => ParseJson<T>(jsonText.ToString());\n        public static T ParseJson<T>(string json)\n        {\n            try\n            {\n                return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<T>(json, new JsonSerializerSettings\n                {\n                    Converters = Converters,\n                })!;\n            }\n            catch (Exception e)\n            {\n                throw new ParseJsonException(e);\n            }\n        }\n        public static T ParseJson<T>(Stream jsonStream)\n        {\n            try\n            {\n                var serializer = new JsonSerializer();\n                foreach (var conv in Converters)\n                    serializer.Converters.Add(conv);\n                using var sr = new StreamReader(jsonStream);\n                using var jsonTextReader = new JsonTextReader(sr);\n                return serializer.Deserialize<T>(jsonTextReader)!;\n            }\n            catch (Exception e)\n            {\n                throw new ParseJsonException(e);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    internal sealed class ParseJsonException : Exception\n    {\n        public ParseJsonException(Exception inner) : base(inner.Message, inner)\n        { }\n    }\n}<|endoftext|>Abstract: A search is presented for the pair production of heavy vector-like B quarks, primarily targeting B quark decays into a W boson and a top quark. The search is based on 36.1 fb(-1) of pp collisions at root s = 13 TeV recorded in 2015 and 2016 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Data are analysed in the lepton-plus-jets final state, characterised by a high-transverse-momentum isolated electron or muon, large missing transverse momentum, and multiple jets, of which at least one is b-tagged. No significant deviation from the Standard Model expectation is observed. The 95% confidence level lower limit on the B mass is 1350 GeV assuming a 100% branching ratio to Wt. In the SU(2) singlet scenario, the lower mass limit is 1170 GeV. The 100% branching ratio limits are found to be also applicable to heavy vector-like X production, with charge +5/3, that decay into Wt. This search is also sensitive to a heavy vector-like B quark decaying into other final states (Zb and Hb) and thus mass limits on B production are set as a function of the decay branching ratios.<|endoftext|>had someone tell me once \"The trick to reading faster is to read faster.\"  Made sense, and it works.  the problem is comprehension, and that takes time to glean and practice. \n\nStudying, for me, was all about process.  i had/have a stage by stage process - flash cards, vocabulary, note reviews from previous chapters, wrong answer correction, reading current chapter, practice questions.   *THEN* I would start in on homework.

Most major Cryptocurrencies departed from the all-time highs 6 months ago but just a month ago Terra set its all-time high of $119 and this proves that it was getting stronger each and every day. Of course, what goes up must come down but what happened to Terra shoe that there was too much violence and it was severely brutalized and just some minutes ago it fell and has set an all-time low of $0.00003644.\nWhen investors are taking off their profits from the table they sell their volatile coins and buy stable coins since they are stable in value and pegged at $1. Terra had its own stable coin called TerraUSD (UST) and it's so sad it was involved in this horrific turmoil.\nOn 9 May t was reported that Luna had emptied their BTC reserve wallet and at the moment the TerraUST was trading at 0.95 and Luna was now 32% down. This move triggered the emotions of traders and investors all of a sudden the TerraUST fell hard and was now trading at around $0.5. When the market is bearish investors find refuge in Stable coins, but imagine you are in a crisis and you are expecting someone to save you and you see that person struggling with his own troubles obvious you will be hopeless. This is exactly what happened w TerraUST, investors were supposed to find refuge there but it was crushing and it left them with no option except to sell Luna. From there it stopped raining and it was now pouring into the Luna Ecosystem and Luna fell like dominoes to its current all-time low.\nWhen things get out of hand we expect it to be improved with time but on LUNA it's getting worse each and every day and that is why I doubt it will ever recover from this blow. We know that too much supply will result in low demand and a drastic fall in the price. If you check terrasco you will see that the LUNA supply is always increasing and it's now sitting at 6,907,376,873,996, more like a meme token, and tomorrow we will have a new big figure.\nIt's now an inflationary token and in about 3 days it increased from 728 million to 6.9 trillion, everyone is just selling what they have and I think everyone who is holding LUNA saw his/her portfolio going to dust, and it's now just a worthless pennies in their wallets. The LUNA developers shut down their blockchain after validators agreed on that decision. Then Crypto.com suspended the trading of LUNA and any tokens operation in the LUNA ecosystem. Even if it happens that it's back online, they will lose a lot of investors because now people have lost faith in it because so much happened in a short space of time.\nIf you are a Trader interested in trading Currencies, Metals, Indices, and Crypto Currencies with small margins on Exness register here.<|endoftext|>On 20 April 2017, Malcolm"

As a result of the Chinese Energy Reduction Program, Factory shutdowns in China have compounded the supply and pricing situation.\nWith respect to petrochemicals, including UV, polyurethane, and acrylic resins and solvents, costs for these materials have been escalating since early 2020, with some of these having demand increases outside of normal levels.\nThe overall logistics situation also remains difficult. The industry continues to face shortages in steel for drums and High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) feedstocks used for pails and jugs. Increased eCommerce demand is driving a tight supply of corrugated boxes and inserts. Material allocation, production delays, feedstock Force Majeures, and labor shortages increase packaging costs. And then on top of this, the pandemic has been a catalyst for abnormal consumer purchase activity (both during and after shutdowns), causing unusual demand within multiple industries and straining both air and sea freight capacity.\nJet fuel costs, for example, have increased as high as 8-10 times the norm, along with shipping container costs, further exacerbated by unusual ocean freight schedules and freight carriers being stranded or challenged to find ports to offload containers. Ultimately, increased demand and ill-prepared logistics have caused a critical freight capacity shortage.<|endoftext|>Pattern Metric Combination Spanner35193 DRAPER Draper HI-TORQ 12mm Short, ManufacturerDraper Tools,Polished Draper HI-TORQ ring end offset at 15\u00b0, Jaw offset at 15\u00b0, Direct Fit, DIY Car Service Parts, Bosch Glow Plugs, Glow Plugs, Manufacturer Part NumberDraper Tools.Combination Spanner35193 DRAPER Draper HI-TORQ 12mm Short Pattern Metric,DRAPER Draper HI-TORQ 12mm Short Pattern Metric Combination Spanner35193, Business, Office & Industrial Supplies, Industrial Hand Tools, Spanner, Industrial Spanners.\nbelieve we must work hard to achieve your satisfaction.

This has resulted in a continuous rise in new daily cases from the 100 range to the 300 range and eventually to the 500 range in recent weeks.\nAccording to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA), the nation added 583 infections including 553 locally transmitted cases for Wednesday, raising the total caseload to 32,318. This was a sharp rise from 382 identified the day before.\nThe number of new daily cases surpassed 500 for the first time since early March when the country was hit by the first wave of infections.\nKorea experienced the first wave of infections centered on the Daegu branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in February and March, and the second wave of infections in August and September after a large-scale rally took place in central Seoul, Aug. 15.\nThe latest increase in cases that has caused the third wave of the pandemic is attributed to sporadic infection clusters that have continued to grow from human interactions related to everyday activities.\nAccording to the KDCA, the recent clusters have been traced to schools, private educational institutes, churches"

The two would seem to cancel each other out, but, we live in a world of fake news and alternate facts. People believe what they choose to believe until they experience something different. Right now many of us are experiencing a lot of large vehicles with darkened windows roaming through our streets like a foreign invasion.\nMany business reports are showing a decline in the tech and construction industries. (look it up for yourselves) At the same time, there is also an expected loss of revenues coming from the federal coffers over the next four years that could seriously impact many projects the city was planning to fund, including those proposed by the SFMTA. These issues are largely based on international financial chaos and political uncertainties.\nThe tech buses may not be needed much longer. If these uncertainties continue and there is a decline in ridership they should downsize the buses and fleets to reflect that change.\nThe corporations that run the shuttles on our city streets should be responsible for generating reports on the number of buses and passengers that use these shuttles, much as the short term rental services are being required to do now. As far as I know the reports are being generated by public volunteers.\nRequiring reports would be a good first step in solving this problem.\nThere is a capacity problem no matter how you try to move because the development policies are not in sync.

The developer fees do not cover the costs and they come too late.\nThere are too many forces driving the increase in traffic on all the modes.\nPeople moving here are pushing people who live and work here out to the suburbs forcing more people to commute in to work, while many new residents are commuting out.\nAdd all the contractors and others who have to drive in to work whose businesses were pushed out, by those moving in, and you have a lot more regional traffic than we had a few years ago. All it took was a shuffle or two of the housing deck to rack up the rents and property values to create this mess.\nThe public wants relief now SFMTA has its head in the future, planning ways to disrupt and rearrange traffic and buses instead of buying buses and hiring drivers to add capacity now. They are racking up tax dollars in studies and experiments while blaming everyone but themselves for the traffic they created.

These cells were then \u201creprogrammed\u201d into a stem cell-like state, otherwise known as iPSCs. The iPSCs were then turned into cells resembling placental cells in early pregnancy. This enabled the team to create the preeclampsia \u201cdisease in the dish\u201d model. Using this model, they were then able to study the processes that cause, result from, or are otherwise associated with preeclampsia.\nThe findings revealed that cellular defects observed are related to an abnormal response in the environment in the womb. Specifically, they found that preeclampsia was associated with a low-oxygen environment in the uterus. The researchers used a computer modeling system at UC San Diego known as Comet to detail the differences between normal and preeclampsia placental tissue.\nHorii and her team hope that these findings not only shed more light on the environment in the womb observed in preeclampsia, but also provided insight for future development of diagnostic tools and identification of potential medications. Furthermore, they hope that their iPSC disease model can be used to study other placenta-associated pregnancy disorders such as fetal growth restriction, miscarriage, and preterm birth.\nThe team\u2019s next steps are to develop a 3D model to better study the relationship between environment and development of placental disease.\nIn a news release from UC San Diego, Horri elaborates more on these future goals.\nThe full study was published in Scientific Reports.<|endoftext|>This town in Yeoncheon, Gyeonggido Province is near the inter-Korean border.

Born and raised in Brazil, she moved to the UK where she worked as a product designer and illustrator creating toys for the Walt Disney Company. After receiving her Masters of Arts degree from the London College of Communication, she moved to Germany where she currently resides with her husband.\nIn addition to being generally awesome, Cale was also a winner of our RB Sticker Redesign Challenge, has been a vegetarian for more than 7 years, and got her first tattoo at age 17.\nWhat is your creative tool of choice?\nA pencil and Adobe Illustrator. I always draw my ideas on paper first, then digitize them into vector. Illustrator allows me to correct or change lines, and using it for coloring is the best part as I can very easily change palettes and test different finishes.\nDescribe yourself in 7 words or less.\nArt, love, life, and nature.\nIf you could gain any artistic skill overnight, what would it be?\nI\u2019d love to know how to paint with colored pencil and watercolor on paper. I used to do it a lot when I was at university, but with technology becoming so heavily involved in everyday life I lost the skill. It is easier to color on Illustrator and correct it with a button, then to re-do all the entire artwork if you make a mistake while painting on paper.\n\"Love Mom & Dad\"\nWhat inspired your brand name, \u201cKiller Wolf\u201d?\nMy name is Clelia, but everybody knows me as Cale. My surname is Lobba (which originates from Yugoslavia, but my family comes from northern Italy and Brazil). Lobba sounds like \u2018loba\u2019 that in Spanish and Portuguese means \u2018she-wolf\u2019. It also refers to my favourite song \u2018Killer Wolf\u2019 by Glenn Danzig. It is a strong name, that is why I use Killer Wolf as my brand.\nShare with us a bit about where you live.\nI live in Herzogenaurach, a small village in Bavaria. I moved to Germany 2 years ago when I was offered a job at PUMA. It turned out really well. I always wanted to live in the countryside and be closer to nature. As a creative person, I thought it would be very unlikely to find a job outside of big cities and the metropolis. Moving here was like a dream come true. I ride my bicycle to work every day and spend my time walking through the woods or running when I am free. During the Summer I enjoy the beer festivals around Bavaria.\nIf you could go back in time, what advice would you give to your younger self?\nI would tell little Cale not to be afraid because life is beautiful. Trust more her intuition and continue developing her creative skills. Above all, enjoy life to its most and be patient.\nOf all your works on Redbubble, which is your favorite? Why?\nThe Shaman is very special because it reflects myself and my influences. In North America and northern Asia, a shaman is a spiritual person that has a connection to creation through nature. In my drawing, the shaman wears a bear over her head, that represent the animal spirit and the power of nature. It reflects my love and respect for nature as it inspires me in all aspects of my life.\nBorn and raised in Brazil, you\u2019ve lived in the U.K. and now Germany, how have these places and cultures influenced your art?\nI\u2019m influenced by bright colors, flowers, and plants. I guess I got that from growing up in Brazil. In Europe, I have access to museums, art galleries, and exhibitions. It all contributes to creating my set of references. One thing I have admired since I was a child is Byzantine art. I don\u2019t know if it comes down to geography or simply culture, but I love to visit churches and exhibitions of medieval and Renaissance religious art. Europe has plenty of that!\nI\u2019m looking forward to designing more animals and anything related to fantasy. I recently watched Beauty and the Beast and had an idea for an illustration.\nWhat inspires you? Share your favorite artists, writers, and musicians with our community.\nListening to my favourite songs always inspires me and makes my mind fly away. It fuels so much of my creativity that I need to put it out and express myself somehow. I do this through my drawings. The choice of music also depends on my mood. I\u2019m into rock \u2018n\u2019 roll but love listening to Depeche Mode, Danzig, Loreena McKennitt, Billie Holiday and HIM when designing. In terms of literature, I am a classic fan. I"

Only one can survive... Command the marine forces! Use deadly weaponery, setting traps and mines in corridors to defend the human race. Command the alien race! Use secret passages and ventilation ducts to launch surprise attacks and grow small aliens to take control of the station. Command the scientists! Use computers and technological devices to gather data and record information about other inhabitants of the station. Command the Greys race! Use their mind powers to control the enemy and use them for your own purposes. The fifth faction? It's a mystery. It's precisely why you made the trek to Theseus, and it's precisely why you will die... In Theseus: The Dark Orbit, players move their pawns around the space station and activate the abilities of different rooms. Every move you take changes the movement possibilities of your opponent. On your turn, you need to think about which room you want to reach and (in addition) how to mess your opponent's movement, which leads to great choices and meaningful decisions. Rooms abilities change during the game as players install trait cards that give rooms new abilities and skills. Players create Theseus during gameplay by placing traps, smart guns, secret passages and many other features. In every game Theseus looks different; in every game it's deadly for you in a new way... Rules for team play allow players to engage in incredibly emotional 2-vs-2 battles. With perfectly balanced factions, players will be able to fight engaging and deadly battles as a teams. Each faction has a unique deck of cards, and before the game starts, you discard ten cards from the deck. In basic mode you discard at random, while in tournament (master) mode you choose cards and build your deck.

Therefore, Hong-do-go-deul- ppae-gi has not yet been clearly identified taxonomically. Hybridization usually occurs in geographical locations where the parent species are sympatric. Hence, it is necessary to observe individuals in an area where C. denticulatum and C. lanceolatum co-occur. Therefore, Hongdo Island is unsuitable since only C. denticulatum is distributed in the region.\nMolecular markers such as the nrITS regions have been used extensively to investigate hybrid speciation. Although in some cases, the utility of nrITS is limited in plant phylogenetic inference (\u00c1lvarez and Wendel, 2003), the molecular marker has been very useful in identifying hybrid taxa progenitors due to its biparental inheritance nature (Sang et al., 1995; Li, 2006; Du et al., 2009; Les et al., 2009; H\u00f8ibov\u00e1 et al., 2011; Kokubugata et al., 2011). Since hybrid species originate by mixing genomes from two different species, detection of the parental genome in the putative hybrid taxa can be direct evidence of hybrid speciation. Furthermore, the addition of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) data can help the detection and indicate the direction of hybridization in plants (Rieseberg et al., 1993; Schwarzbach and Rieseberg, 2002). Hence, it becomes necessary to examine not only internal transcribed spacer (ITS) but also cpDNA.\nAdditionally, previous studies (Kitamura, 1955; Saito et al., 2006; Ohashi and Ohashi, 2007) have suggested habit, margins of cauline leaves, number of involucral bracts and florets as identification keys of Crepidiastrum hybrids. However, such identification keys are not adequate, and additional morphological traits need to be reviewed.\nIn the present study, to reveal the hybrid origin of Hong-do-go-deul-ppae-gi, its morphological traits were observed based on specimens collected from other regions along with Hongdo Island. One nuclear ribosomal ITS region and four chloroplast regions (trnT-L, trnL-F, rpl16 intron, rps16 intron) of the putative hybrid and its closely related taxa were analyzed. Finally, the morphological traits were described.\nTwenty-four individuals were collected from seven localities in Korea (Fig. 1). To compare the morphological traits of the putative hybrid and its closely related taxa, we examined living materials and herbarium specimens stored at the herbarium of the Korea National Arboretum (KH), National Institute of Biological Resources (KB), Inha University (IUI) and registered at the Korea National Biospecies Information System (http://www.nature.go.kr), the collection database of specimens and materials (http://db.kahaku.go.jp/webmuseum_en/). Morphological traits were observed visually and under a stereomicroscope and sizes measured using a Mitutoyo 500-196-30 Absolute Digimatic Vernier caliper (Kanagawa, Japan). Additionally, protologues, flora, and monographs were referred to.\nLeaf material from each individual was collected in silica gel for DNA extractions with voucher specimens (deposited in the herbarium of the Korea National Arboretum, KH). Total genomic DNA was extracted from dried leaf materials with silica gel using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted DNA was electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel to confirm the presence or absence of DNA. The concentration and quality of DNA were confirmed using a NanoDrop ND-1000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA).\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the ITS of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) and four noncoding regions (trnT-L, trnL-F, rpl16 intron, and rps16 intron) of the cpDNA was performed. The total volume of each PCR mix was 20 \u03bcL, comprising 15 \u03bcL of distilled water, 1.0 \u03bcL of each primer (50 mM), 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase master mix (Amplicon, R\u00f8dovre, Denmark). The primers used for PCR amplification and the PCR cycle conditions are listed in Table 1. In addition, primers ITS 2 forward and ITS 3 reverse (White et al., 1990) were used as internal primers for sequencing confirmation in both directions, particularly in the hybrids that showed nucleotide polymorphisms. The PCR products were visualized in 1% agarose gels and sequenced using an ABI 3730xl DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The determined sequences were deposited in GenBank (Table 2). Additionally, C, platyphyllum individuals deposited in GenBank were used for phylogenetic analysis. The analyzed nucleotide sequences were determined after checking the chromatogram using Geneious R 7.1.9 (Biomatters Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand). All sequences were aligned using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004). Polymorphic sites in the ITS region were identified by overlapping peaks on the chromatogram.\nMaximum likelihood trees based on the nrITS region and the combined four cpDNA regions (trnT-L, trnL-F, rpl16 intron, and rps16 intron) were constructed using the W-IQ-TREE Server (http://iqtree.cibiv.univie.ac.at/) (Trifinopoulos et al., 2016), based on user-friendly web servers for IQ-TREE 1.5 (Nguyen et al., 2015). Each aligned sequence dataset was tested to determine the best-fit model by using W-IQ-TREE with the Akaike criterion, and new model selection procedures. TIM3e was confirmed as the best-fit model for the selected nrITS and cpDNA regions. We evaluated the node supported by 1,000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates (UFBS) (Minh et al., 2013). Youngia japonica (L.) DC., which is most closely related to the genus Crepidiastrum, was used as an outgroup (Kilian et al., 2009).\nAs a result of observing the morphological traits, putative hybrid individuals were classified into three morphological types. All morphotypes had 10\u201312 florets but lacked basal leaves at anthesis. They grow on sunny slopes that were adjacent to mountains and coasts. However, Type 1 had herbaceous and erect stem branching in the upper part, mixed entire and serrate margins, 1.2\u20131.8 mm outer phyllaries, and achenes with 0.5\u20130.9 mm beaks. Type 2 had a suffrutescent stems with stout and short caudex, branched at the base, mixed entire and serrate margins, 1.4\u20131.6 mm outer phyllaries, and achenes with 0.2\u20130.5 mm beaks. Type 3 had a suffrutescent stem with stout and short caudex, branched at the base, mixed entire and serrate margins, 0.4\u20130.7 mm outer phyllaries, and achenes with 0.5\u20130.7 mm beaks. All three morphotypes showed that C. denticulatum and C. lanceolatum had mixed morphological traits (Fig. 2, Table 3). Type 1 and Type 2 were observed in Busan, Type 2 was observed on Somaemuldo Island, Type 2 and Type 3 were observed on Geomundo Island, and Type 3 was observed on Chujado and Hongdo Islands.\nThe sizes of the nrITS regions in C. platyphyllum, C. denticulatum, C. lanceolatum were 640 bp, 639 bp, and 638 bp, respectively. Size variation among the individuals within the same species was not observed. Four accessions of C. platyphyllum had identical sequences, while five accessions of C. denticulatum were grouped into three ribotypes (A, B, C) which differed at nucleotide position of 603, and five accessions of C. lanceolatum were grouped into three ribotypes (D, E, F) that differed at three nucleotide sites (200, 212, 434 bp) (Table 4). After alignment, a data set with a length of 641 bp was obtained. The length variation of the aligned sequence data was due to 1 to 3 bp of indels (insertion/deletion events). C. platyphyllum had 249 bp (1 indel) for the nrITS 1 region, 164 bp for the 5.8S, and 227 bp for nrITS 2 region. C. denticulatum and C. lanceolatum had 250 bp for the nrITS 1 region, 164 bp for 5.8S, but 225 bp (2 indels) and 224 bp (3 indels) for the nrITS 2 region, respectively. Excluding the gaps, the putative parental species showed sequence variation at a total of ten nucleotide sites. The pairwise-sequence difference between C. denticulatum and C lanceolatum was six nucleotide substitutions and one indel. C. denticulatum and C. platyphyllum differed by eight nucleotide substitutions and three indels. C lanceolatum and C. platyphyllum could be distinguished by six nucleotide substitutions and four indels. Therefore, the three taxa of Crepidiastrum were clearly distinguished in the nrITS regions. Among the putative hybrid types, Type 1 and Type 2 exhibited polymorphic ITS signals at those seven sites differentiating C. denticulatum and"

Sori orbicular, 1\u20134 per segment, located on the middle of veinlets. Indusia reniform, persistent, almost entire or somewhat serrate at margin, densely covered with hairs.\nHabitat: In rocks of limestone regions within forests.\nDistribution: Yeongwol-gun, Gangwon-do, Korea.\nSpecimens examined: KOREA. Gangwon-do: Yeongwol-gun, Hanbando-myeon, elev. 240 m, 24 Sep 2016, C.S. Lee & K. Lee 16092401 (EWH [4 sheets], KH [3 sheets], KB [3 sheets]; 28 Oct 2013, K. Lee & M.K. Lee 13102801 (KH [1 sheet]).\nTaxonomic notes: The newly reported taxon in Korea, Hypodematium squamuloso-pilosum is known as an endemic in China (Zhang and Iwatski, 2013) but was found first in Gangwon-do in Korea.\nThe new local name \u2018Huin-geum-teol-go-sa-ri\u2019 was given based on its having throughout long white hairy. It was firstly found with Cornus walteri, Fraxinus rhynchophylla, Celtis koraiensis, Lespedeza maximowiczii, Ulmus davidiana var. japonica, Juniperus rigida, Aster scaber, and Commelina communis in a forest in Hanbando-myeon, Yeongwol-gun, Gangwon-do.\nThis taxon is distinguished from H. glanduloso-pilosum (Tagawa) Ohwi reported as one species of Hypodematium in Korea based on scales in rhizome and stipe base linear to narrowly lanceolate, white long hairs throughout leaves, rarely reddish brown curly linear scales on stipe, and basal pinna oblong-lanceolate.\nThe chromosome numbers of H. squamuloso-pilosum and H. hirsutum have the same type as n = 41 (41 II) based on cytotaxonomic study by Wang et al. (2014). This taxon firstly described from Korea was most similar with H. hirsutum distributed in China, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, and Nepal based on rhizome, scale shape and size, sori position, and hairs in indusia (Iwatsuki, 1992, 1995; Wang et al., 2010; Zhang and Iwatsuki, 2013) (Table 1). Hypodematium fordii distributed in China and Japan was also similar with H. squamuloso-pilosum, but the former has different characters from the latter based on almost glabrous upward in stipe, densely glandular hairs in lamina, triangular ovate basal pinna, and sparsely glandular hairs in indusia (Table 1).\nComparative morphological characters between Hypodematium squamuloso-pilosum Ching, and related species distributed in China and Japan of Hypodematium (Iwatsuki, 1992; Wang et al., 2010; Zhang and Iwatsuki, 2013).\nFurthermore, it was distinguished from other taxa of the genus Hypodematium the distinct characters such as densely long hairs throughout the leaf and sparsely with glandular hairs and reddish brown curly linear scales, and basal pinna oblong lanceolate (Table 1).\nChing R-C. 1963;A reclassification of the family Thelypteridaceae from the mainland of Asia.

Why am I not surprised? Two different people with two different cultures and two different family styles just do not view things eye to eye....\nHonestly, I think it would be better off for my parents to go back home. I know about the fact that the medical facilities and services here are better, but if my mom is having this chest pains and headaches every night, what am I supposed to do? I can just ignore her and tell her it's nothing.. but what if throughout the course of it something really happens? What if it becomes the story of \"the boy who cried wolf?\"\nI know... I know that if an emergency truly happens, that if an attack truly happens, we can always call 911. But how am I supposed to know when it's really \"emergency\"?\nDid I tell you that when I called the MEDICAID here on Hawaii, I was informed that eligibility is after 5 years from the date of arrival? So, basically we'll have to pay for her medical expenses in cash for 5 years. I called Kaiser and there's no available help there either.\nWhat complicates this situation is my parents' immigration status. If they go back home and stayed there for more than 6 months, the immigrant status will expire. That would be a problem. The easy solution is for them to come back here for a couple months visits before it expires...except that we don't have the finances to buy another round trip ticket. we don't have the finances to keep on buying the round trip tickets every six months. If only my AD here on the blog would enable me to make an extra $2,000 dollars within the next six month, then that can go to purchasing their ticket. But I do not have the gazillion readers for my ad to make the money I need. My brother Relly said maybe we should start buying the lotto tickets - who knows, we might win! right? riiiighhhhhhtttt!\nI thought this week I would be having a lot of \"happy posts\"... I guess not....\nKeep praying... pray that we make the right decision....\nFirst of all I wanted to thank you for visiting my blog and secondly, I hope you find the strenght to do whatever is best for everyone. I understand your parents desire to go home. If I had the money and a job I wouldn't think about it twice, first thing tomorrow morning I'd be heading back home to Spain.\nI'll be thinking of you and praying for you to make the best decision for everybody involved!\nhi liza, thanks for visiting my blog. life really goes full circle, we will have our turn to watch over our parents. i know one day i will be doing the same. i hope you will find the solution that is best for all.\nSorry to hear about your family's predicament, Liza.\nMay the Lord guide you all as you make your decisions.\nLiza on Maui said...\nThanks ayogi, kristen, mixednuts and jayred.\nOh Liza, I wish there was an easy, clear cut answer, but I trust that God will take care of you all.\nMy parents went through a similar process when my nana wanted to move back \"home\". Currently, they are in the process of moving my uncle to Hawaii from the P.I.\nWill be praying...\nAw, I am praying.<|endoftext|>From March through November, the Government House Historical Society (GHHS) hosts Victorian Tea weekends once a month.\nHeld in the beautiful Government House Ballroom, a typical tea includes three sandwiches, a fresh scone and preserves, and a dessert, all served with an endless pot of specially blended tea.\nGo to the Government House Historical Society website for all things tea related.<|endoftext|>Born in Bonghwa (Korea).

The province reported nine more deaths and 1,265 new cases and the total of 13,719 active cases was the highest number yet.\nThe province is also dealing with outbreaks in acute-care facilities and announced new visitation rules Wednesday for affected facilities.

The global death toll stood at more than 1.4 million.\nIn the United States, president-elect Joe Biden appealed for unity Wednesday in a pre-Thanksgiving address, asking Americans to \"steel our spines\" for a fight against coronavirus he predicts will continue for months.\n\"Each of us has a responsibility in our own lives to do what we can to slow the virus,\" he said in remarks in Wilmington, Del.\nBut record hospitalizations and a surging death toll appeared did not seem to be keeping travellers at bay before for this weekend's American Thanksgiving.\nNearly one million passengers a day have been screened at airport security checkpoints for the past week, with Sunday's total of 1.047 million being the highest number since the early days of the pandemic in mid-March.\n\"We know we're taking a risk, but we want to see the family and it has been a long time... so we want to see them and have fun,\" said Daliza Rodriguez, a 33-year-old childhood educator, as she travelled to Texas from New York's LaGuardia Airport on Wednesday.\nAs California battles a surge, the state's health secretary is urging families to avoid gathering for Thanksgiving.

The Defence Ministry said in a statement the recruits had been taking basic training at an army unit in Yeoncheon, a town near the tense border with North Korea, at the start of their 18 months of mandatory military service.\nIt said more tests are underway to determine whether 860 other recruits and troops at the Yeoncheon unit have been infected with the virus, too.\nIn Europe, France will start easing measures to curb the virus this weekend so people will be able to spend the holiday with their families. The country said a vaccine could start being administered by the end of year if approved by regulators.\nBritain's government reduced its commitment to foreign aid on Wednesday, pledging to spend 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product on aid in 2021 as opposed to the normal 0.7 per cent figure, Finance Minister Rishi Sunak said.\nWhile expressing \"great respect to those who have argued passionately to retain this target,\" Sunak said that \"sticking rigidly\" to it \"is difficult to justify\" to people at a time when the economy has been so battered by the coronavirus pandemic.\nSpain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Wednesday that his government was considering limiting Christmas celebrations to six people in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus.\nHealth experts and scientists have advised that six is a sufficiently low number to help stop the virus, Sanchez said. The final details of the restrictions will be negotiated with regional authorities.\nIn the Middle East, Israel's central bank urged the government to approve a 2021 state budget as soon as possible to avoid further fiscal restraint when the economy needs stimulus to weather the crisis.\nIran registered on Wednesday a"

Most Western governments initially responded with indifference as the savagery spread throughout Rwanda, resulting in the massacre of between 500,000 and 1 million people in three months. The United Nations officially declared the attacks an act of genocide. Ms. Des Forges sounded early warnings about the violence before Congress and repeatedly called for international intervention. She pleaded with the Clinton administration's State Department, to no avail, to block the signals of Rwandan radio stations fomenting the massacre by urging Hutus to kill the Tutsi \"cockroaches.\"<|endoftext|>Whether it\u2019s the transition to e-mobility or the electrification of our heating systems: Batteries are a key technology in the fight against climate change. If we want to move away from dirty combustion engines and oil and gas heating, we need much more storage capacity. The global battery production will therefore rise sharply in the coming years. Critics of the rapid expansion of these technologies repeatedly cite the environmental destruction and human rights violations associated with the production of batteries. These arguments cannot be dismissed today, because the mining of raw materials destroys nature and livelihoods. The production of batteries consumes a lot of energy and batteries are still too rarely recycled at the end of their life.\nBut all this can be changed! Electromobility can become a real alternative to combustion engines if electric vehicle batteries are produced and recycled in an environmentally friendly and socially responsible way. In Europe, we therefore want to establish clear rules for the sustainability of all batteries. The European Commission has presented a legislative proposal for a new EU battery regulation. The recycling of batteries including sensitive materials like lithium and cobalt should be massively increased. And although many parts of the proposal are very good, there is still room for improvement. We Greens want to advocate for effective climate protection. Genuine recycling of every single battery must become mandatory in Europe so that our consumption of raw materials does not continue to rise. And for the whole supply chain of batteries we need binding due diligence obligations to end human rights violations and destruction of nature during production. We are already hearing about attempts by various lobby groups to water down the Commission\u2019s proposal.\nLet\u2019s set global standards for clean batteries together. If we limit the plundering of people, the environment, and resources, we simultaneously turn the new rules into an opportunity to massively increase battery production in Europe and thus secure competitiveness and jobs. This way we win twice.\nThe new EU Battery Regulation is another concrete legislative proposal within the framework of the European Green Deal. The European Parliament\u2019s Environment Committee will discuss the Commission\u2019s draft in the coming weeks and months. This is because the European Parliament, together with the Council of Member States, decides on the final text of any EU law. This is our opportunity to further improve the rules. I will be sitting at the negotiating table on behalf of the Green Group. Some areas are also the responsibility of the Internal Market Committee, where my colleague Anna Cavazzini is dealing with the issue.\nI therefore ask you for your support: send me concrete proposals and approaches to improve the legislative text so that we can ensure clean batteries in Europe.\nOf course, I will keep you informed about further steps \u2013 because the road to sustainable batteries is a long one.<|endoftext|>SEOUL: South Korea plans to launch its homegrown space rocket next week, after aerospace engineers replaced a malfunctioning part in the oxidiser tank sensor, which forced the country to call off the rocket launch this week.\nThe Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) canceled Thursday's scheduled launch of Nuri, also known as KSLV-II, after the sensor was seen malfunctioning during a final pre-launch checkup at the launch pad in Naro Space Center in Goheung, a southern coastal village some 470 kms south of Seoul, on Wednesday.\n\"We plan to hold a launch management committee to pursue the second launch (of Nuri) on June 21, \" Kwon Hyun-joon, an official at the science ministry, said.\nThe ministry has set the period through June 23 as the launch window, reports Yonhap news agency.\nNuri is scheduled to be moved back to the launch pad next Monday, the day before the launch, and it will be subject to constant inspections until Tuesday's planned liftoff.\nKwon, however, said the plan could change depending on weather conditions.\nKARI also said the launch date could be changed, as Naro Space Center is expecting a 60 to 70 percent chance of rain on the launch day.\nThe envisioned launch would be Nuri's second liftoff, following its maiden voyage in October.\nIn its first launch, Nuri successfully flew to a target altitude of 700 kilometers but failed to put a dummy satellite into orbit, as its third-stage engine burned out earlier than expected.\nSouth Korea has invested nearly $1.8 billion in building Nuri since 2010.\nThe country plans to conduct four additional Nuri rocket launches by 2027 as part of efforts to further advance the country's space rocket programme.<|endoftext|>Although time to event data is traditionally analyzed assuming independent responses, it is common to encounter correlated time to event data in the form of repeated measurements on subjects or clusters of subjects formed by genetic or social relationships. The objective of this research is to develop estimation procedures for clustered survival data that improve efficiency in estimating regression coefficients in Cox proportional hazards model without imposing overwhelming computational burdens;A commonly used method for clustered survival data obtains parameter estimates from the partial likelihood score equations based on a model that incorrectly assumes independent observations. This independent working model (IWM) approach provides consistent estimators with asymptotic Gaussian distribution and a robust covariance estimator provides a consistent estimator of the covariance matrix of the parameter estimates. The availability of the software in most statistical packages has led to the wide use of this methodology for correlated survival data. Because of the potential loss of efficiency when within cluster correlation is strong, we examine two alternative methods to improve efficiency;We first considered a simplified approach to estimate weights in the weighted estimating equations proposed by Cai and Prentice (1997). This approach reduces the computational burden of the Cai and Prentice methodology. We also consider a new set of weighted estimating equations obtained by inserting weight matrices into the IWM score equations in a different manner. Another set of estimating equations is developed by applying a generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach using approximate Poisson distributions for counting process differentials. The bootstrap procedure is used to estimate the covariance matrix of the parameter estimates;Simulation studies are used to assess bias, variance and relative efficiency of the proposed estimators. Results show that the biases of all of the estimators are small and comparable, but there may be substantial gains in efficiency by incorporating weight matrices into estimating equations when the within cluster correlation is strong and the censoring rate is low. Simulation studies confirm that the bootstrap procedure provides accurate standard errors for estimates of regression coefficients and confidence intervals with appropriate coverage probabilities.\nZhang, Xiaohong, \"Generalized estimating equations for clustered survival data \" (2006).

To identify the virus from G. procumbens, RT-PCR analysis was performed using several genus-specific primers sets. BBWV2-Gyp was identified from the amplified target product using Fabavirus genus-specific primers. BBWV2- Gyp had a similar host range pattern to BBWV2\u2013SN that has already reported in G. procumbens. BBWV2-Gyp induced systemic mosaic and BBWV2-SN induced systemic necrotic spots on Phaseolus angularis. To investigate the sequence specificity, BBWV2-Gyp RNA2 was sequenced and compared with other BBWV2 isolates. Sequence homologies and phylogenetic analyses clearly indicated that BBWV2-Gyp had the closest relationship to BBWV2-SN. Also, BBWV2- Gyp had 98.5%, 98.8% and 98.5% homologies with movement protein (MP), large coat protein (LCP) and small coat protein (SCP) segments, respectively, of BBWV2-SN at amino acid level. Although two BBWV2 isolates from G. procumbens have high nucleotide sequence similarity (99%), they have distinct biological properties.\nCarvalho, C. M., Wellink, J., Ribeiro, S. G., Goldbach, R.

Until five years ago when the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) constructed the Naro Space Center in June 2009 and successfully launched the first space launch vehicle, \u2018Naro\u2019, in January 2013, the County was known as an agricultural and fishery region consisting of many islands, producing mainly citrons, pomegranates, garlic, onions, ark clams and sea mustard, not to mention quality rice.\nIn support of the central government\u2019s policy of launching a moon exploration spacecraft by 2020, the County authority aims to develop its aerospace-related industries, including aerospace, renewable energy and commercial space tourism industry. As part of these programs, the municipal government will invest a total of 402.3 billion won (approximately $3.69 million) in this year in conjunction with the central government, KARI and other organizations. To expand infrastructure, such as the second stage expansion of facilities of the space center, a launch test pad, facilities for testing and evaluating flight, and a science rocket center, these organizations will invest 143.6 billion won (approximately $131.7 million).\nAnd the County government will attract investments of 240 billion won (approximately $220.1 million) from private sector for projects of constructing a specialized industrial complex, a space land and green energy facilities. It will build a space theme park, install facilities for testing and evaluating aerospace components, antennas of earth station for moon exploration space ships, gravity-free experience facilities, and smart grids, using government funds. Also it will construct a science rocket center and space land.\nWith the goal of generating renewable energy-based electric power in capacity representing 50% of its total annual power demand of 400 million kWh, the County government plans to build solar photovoltaic power generation plants in capacity of 40mW by the first half of next year jointly with Kossen Co. It will also develop wind power generation farms in capacity of 40mW.\nAs the most ideal region for growing citrons and pomegranates, the County government designated certain parts of the region as special areas for producing and commercializing the well-being fruits in total space of over 246,000 square meters. Leveraging its comparative advantages in producing these fruits, the County authority will develop and commercialize these fruits as high value-added products, while expanding distribution channels. These fruits have been processed simply as teas and fruit juices thus far. To promote citron as a world-class agricultural product, it will ensure safety of citrons, establish foundation for developing new products and sanitary production, and reinforce joint marketing activities in overseas markets. In addition, it will develop high value-added health and functional foods as well as beauty products using pomegranates.\nIn order to develop eco-friendly citrons and pomegranates as new growth engines and to enhance their brand value, the County government will build specialized farming complexes and research institutions. It will also train manpower specializing in export, processing, distribution and marketing of products as well as expertise in intellectual property rights. At the same time, it will promote publicity and experience of these products through events such as festivals in connection with tourism. It plans to invest 29.4 billion won (approximately $26.97 million) in these programs, expecting to gain 51.86 billion won (approximately $47.57 million) in"

B-11 NMR shift and linewidth are huge and strongly temperature dependent. In addition, both are proportional to magnetic susceptibility, indicating that the hyperfine field at the boron site originates from the 4f spins of Tb. The shift and the spin-lattice relaxation rate show high anisotropy for field parallel and perpendicular to the c-axis. Anisotropy of the shift and the relaxation rates suggests that the hyperfine field perpendicular to the c-axis is larger. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The victory saw them take home the Colours Cup, becoming the first Trinity team to win Colours two years in a row since 1996 and the first-ever DUFC team to win a Colours match in the UCD Bowl. Most importantly, however, yesterday\u2019s result means DUFC are within a hair\u2019s breadth of an AIL semi-final.\nThe magnitude of the game was reflected in the sizeable crowd that huddled under the stand of the UCD Bowl for the 67th meeting of the sides. With huge implications in the context of the AIL, alongside the bragging rights of a Colours victory, the sense of occasion was tinged with an undeniable tension that reverberated through the ground.\nAs the game got under way, one punter mused that Trinity\u2019s fine run of form surely made the win a foregone conclusion. Despite his measured prediction, however, it was the home side that set the pace early on in the game. The first half was a melange of heavy hits and handling errors, with both sides struggling to get to grips with the wet playing surface. An early penalty scored by UCD\u2019s top scorer Conall Doherty set the scoreboard ticking over for the men in blue.\nThis jolted DUFC into gear and they began to play something resembling their usual free-flowing rugby. However, complacent passing prevented them from making any telling headway and UCD proved better at adapting to the appalling conditions, focusing on kicking for territory and pressing high on the Trinity 22. Good work off a line-out resulted in a second penalty for the home side, which fly-half Doherty made short work of.\nAfter a gruelling passage of play, with both teams camped on halfway and exchanging possession, DUFC\u2019s Rowan Osbourne spotted a gap and burst through UCD\u2019s defensive line. With the try-line at his mercy, Osbourne offloaded to Max Kearney, but a handling error from the flanker denied Trinity a certain try.\nUCD had survived, but cracks were beginning to show. A burst of brilliance from Trinity,"

These nifty lightweight separators can do wonders for effectively filling every inch of space in your luggage. The best part about this packing hack is that you can effortlessly keep your things organized throughout the duration of your trip. You can purchase packing cubes in a variety of colors and sizes on websites like Amazon, or better yet, you can upgrade your luggage to functional bags and suitcases that come with built-in separators and packing dividers.\nPacking shoes is almost painful for the traveler who can\u2019t stand to carry more than he or she absolutely needs to. Just two pairs of essential footwear take up so much valuable room, leaving awkward patches of empty space in awkward shapes and sizes. Why not make the most of it? Pack what you can fitinsideyour shoes and wedge smaller articles of clothing in the empty space between pairs and the walls of your suitcase.\nPacking your things in smaller bags is a fantastic way to keep things orderly and in an agreeable shape. Instead of tossing all of your toiletries, electronics, and other oddball items into your suitcase, stuff them in Ziploc bags or small totes and wedge them into the empty spaces.\n Cram as much as you can in that carry-on bag (within the weight limits, of course) and keep your flight essentials in your personal bag that you can keep under your seat.\nShampoo, conditioner, bar soap, body wash, a razor, face wash, Q-tips, feminine products, the list goes on and on. Most hotels will supply these essentials for free upon request; all you have to do is ask.\nFor the items that don\u2019t come free at the hotel desk, consider buying them in small quantities at a nearby drugstore once you arrive.\nLast, but not least, one of the most effective packing hacks anyone has ever come up with: vacuum seal bags. These are such a game-changer and if you think you need a vacuum to operate them, think again! Many modern-day vacuum-seal bags require as little as you zipping them shut and applying pressure to force the air out. These are an instant space saver and definitely worth every penny.\nAs you prepare for your upcoming adventure, we hope you use these 10 packing hacks to pack light, travel smart, and enjoy your trip!<|endoftext|>Gageodo Island is the southwesternmost island in Korea, located rather close to China. The island has rough mountain ridges and consists of cliffs, making a magnificent scenery. Centered on Doksilsan Mountain (639m, the highest peak in Sinan-gun), the island is surrounded by cliffs making the area perfect as a mystery island. This place is also beloved by fishers as various fish like anchovy, croaker, hairtail, horse mackerel, sea bream, and others can be found in the surrounding waters, as well as a paradise of unusual migratory birds like the fork-tailed petrel, shearwater, and teal.\nKBS2 - Happy Sunday Variety Show \"2 Days & 1 Night\"\nAccommodation facilities, Songnyeon Post Box, Lighthouse, Restaurant, etc.\nTake a ferry from Mokpo Port Coastal Terminal to Gageodo Island.<|endoftext|>It seems strange to me that, for all the thinking I've been doing, I'm not making progress about the things I'm setting my mind to. Instead, I seem to make headway on things that I haven't thought about, or that have bothered me for a long time.\nToday I realized why I have so much trouble being a part of Crusade and fitting in. I thought for sure that Crusade would be a good fit -- I even had people telling me I looked like a \"Crusade-y kind of guy\". I might fit Crusade, but Crusade doesn't fit me, because the people in the group cannot be friends with me in the ways I need them to.\nI need friends that I can be around on a day-to-day basis. I also need friends I can talk with about things. In high school I had both needs satisfied by Eric. In college I've only found people to be around all the time, but I can't find people to share things with. The people in Crusade, however, can't meet even the day-to-day need.\nWith the Crusade mindset, I can't just get together with people. I can, however, see them at Bible study, or Real Life, or maybe we can evangelize on the corner in downtown Evanston, or have a praise and worship night, etc. I never receive invites to go out to eat without strings attached. It's always \"Come to Friday's PRAYER WALK! We'll be meeting at midnight and walking up and down the campus praying over every building, and then we'll go have ice cream and discuss how to share our faith!\" Otherwise, it's for some sport I'm not aggressive or athletic enough to play. \"Come to Wednesday's TACKLE FOOTBALL IN TECH. Four stories of the most intense, painful football you'll ever experience on God's Green Earth!\"\nThus, today I realized I can't call myself a member of Crusade anymore -- I'm disappointed that three years have gone by and it's taken me that long to figure out why I haven't made any headway towards developing friendships there.<|endoftext|>Guy (21m) suddenly stopped talking to me (20f) and deleted me from social media\n\nI (20f) have been talking to this guy (21m) who I met on Bumble for a few weeks now.

I though, no biggie, maybe he\u2019s just busy, although it did seem a bit odd because he\u2019s a fast texter. This morning I went to Snapchat him something and noticed that he un-added me on there. Then I went back to Bumble and noticed we were no longer matched on there either. \n\nI\u2019m wondering whether it\u2019s best to just cut my losses and forget about it, or if I should try to figure out what\u2019s up. I really like talking to him, and the feeling seemed mutual. \n\nNow I\u2019m just left confused and wondering if I did something wrong. This seems to be a common theme in my life and while I can deal with rejection, the not knowing where things went wrong is what hurts me the most.<|endoftext|>The police yesterday were investigating the death of a 1-year-old boy from Brooklyn, who died at St. Mary's Hospital after being taken there on Saturday.\nThe boyfriend of the boy's mother, Nicole Hamilton, called 911 on Saturday, and the baby died yesterday afternoon, the police said.\nMs. Hamilton's other children, a 4-year-old boy and infant twins, a girl and a boy, were taken from her apartment at 82 Marion Street in Bushwick and were awaiting placement in foster care, said Jennifer Falk, a spokeswoman for the Administration for Children's Services.\nMs. Hamilton came to the attention of the agency in March 1999, Ms. Falk said, because of a report that the oldest boy, the only child born at the time, had been neglected. An investigation found evidence of neglect, and counseling was provided, Ms. Falk said. No evidence of abuse was found, she added. Ms. Hamilton and her boyfriend were being questioned last night, the police said.<|endoftext|>The RFP is the first step for the city in finding a partner that can \u201cdesign, build, test and implement\u201d the \u201cbackbone\u201d operating system.\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to correct the timing and amount of the Smart City Challenge grant.\nThe brains behind any great device or process generally rest on a great operating system.\nOfficials involved in Columbus, Ohio\u2019s nationally-watched smart city initiative are moving forward with developing an operating system to support an ambitious coterie of applications to improve mobility, citizen engagement and equity for all the city\u2019s residents.\n\u201cWe see this as the backbone and the heart of the Smart Columbus portfolio of projects,\u201d said Brandi Braun, Columbus' deputy innovation officer.\nThe city has issued an RFP to procure services to \u201cdesign, build, test and implement\u201d the operating system.\nSubmissions are due Feb. 13. The city will then score the proposals and make a recommendation to the city council. The consultant is expected to be on board by April or May.\nIn 2016, Columbus was named the recipient of $50 million in grant money tied to the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s Smart City Challenge. The windfall brought with it some $90 million from local businesses and a sizable portfolio of hardware, software and support services from technology companies. The initiative puts Columbus at the forefront of a groundswell of smart city developments ranging from growing the adoption of electric and autonomous vehicles, revamping mass transit into a more multimodal experience and improving commercial truck traffic through the city.\nThat will involve setting up a lot of data-sharing capacity.\nThose who develop the operating system will not be starting at zero. At the end of December, the city wrapped up work on a data feed system. The city will release the system this month to app developers, who will review the data and offer feedback related to the various applications it could have.\n\u201cWhat this team will do is continue to work on that first iteration and grow it in a way to support the grant project,\u201d said Braun.\n"

President Moon Jae-in has signed a petition calling for their nomination.\nThe campaign dates back to 2005 when Marianne Stoeger, 82, and Margareta Pissar, 81, left home after ending their voluntary sacrifice caring for lepers for four decades at an isolated shelter on Sorokdo Island off the southern coastal county of Goheung.\nThe shelter was built in 1916 during Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule over the Korean peninsula, as a concentration camp for leprosy patients. South Korea later transformed it into a state-subsidized community center with a modern hospital, farmland and welfare facilities.\nAfter graduating from the nursing college of the University of Innsbruck, the two started working as volunteer nurses in the Sorokdo hospital respectively in 1962 and 1966. After their departure in 2005, they were respected as \"Angeles\" among community people or likened to Mother Teresa, known in the Catholic Church as Saint Teresa of Calcutta.\nIn 2006, the two nurses were offered given honorary citizenship. \"Marianne and Margareta,\" a film depicting their life, was screened last year at the government complex in Seoul.<|endoftext|>If you\u2019re looking towards the UK property market for the first time you could read a dozen websites, pick up a dozen newspapers and listen to a dozen people all of which are likely to give different opinions of the market going forward. There is confusion, uncertainty but the man known as \u201cMr Property\u201d, aka Mike Hussey of property developer Almacanter believes the UK is in the middle of a 15 year property boom!\nThis is the kind of positive forward-looking comment that UK property investors have been looking for and while some may see it as a little far-fetched, there are reasons for this particularly upbeat opinion.\nMike Hussey has made some very bold and ultimately very accurate predictions in the past having called similar property cycles at least twice in years gone by. He is adamant that the UK property market run will continue from 2010 towards 2025 and, unlike others who make bold claims, he has backed up his opinion with reasons.\nIt is perhaps ironic that the current situation of extremely low base rates across the world is to all intents and purposes a result of the 2008 economic crash. The ability for not only the banking community but also the investment world to borrow money at extremely low rates is obviously fuel to the fire of property investment. When you also bear in mind the rental incomes available in some areas of the UK there is scope to more than cover your costs from rental income while positioning yourself for long-term capital growth.\nWhen the Conservative Party was facing a difficult general election it was fair to say that all political parties seemed to pander to the need to tax the rich in some shape or form. All parties showed different levels of support for the so called \u201cMansion tax\u201d but now that the Conservative government is in place with a relatively slim majority it is unlikely they will be in a hurry to tax those who backed their party. We also saw an array of interesting plans to accelerate planning permission at local authority level with brownfield sites set to play a major role going forward.\nIn the hustle and bustle of the bid for votes ahead of a general election it is easy to fall into the trap of believing that all political parties will come down hard on the wealthy in society as a means of currying favour with the majority of voters. However, this may not be the case in real life.\nWhile there is evidence to suggest that UK-based property investors are banking some of their profit post the general election, there is also strong evidence to suggest that Chinese investors will target the UK in the future. A lack of sellers across the country will not only help to support prices but it could help to squeeze them higher in due course. It is also worth noting that while the UK government has promised to build hundreds of thousands of new properties during the next Parliament this is not something which will happen overnight.\nWhether or not we are actually in the midst of a 15 year property boom remains to be seen but there is no doubt that the UK market has benefited since 2010 despite the fact that other economies around the world are still struggling. Low interest rates, relatively positive economic performance, weakened political pressure and more overseas investors looking towards the UK do point to a more positive performance in the immediate future.\nWhy Buy In Egypt?<|endoftext|>SAVE YOUR CONCRETE.\nManitoba-based foam jacking repair service providing an affordable alternative to concrete slab replacement and mud jacking.\nFoam jacking is the best solution for concrete levelling and lifting.\nBoost concrete Lifting assists businesses and homeowners who have uneven concrete.\nOver time, concrete slabs like patios, sidewalks, and driveways, can settle unevenly causing the slab to dip or slant.

In 2016, the mandate extends to 95 percent of their employees, and also applies to companies with 50 to 99 workers.\nWhom it affects: Most employers will not be significantly affected. They already offer health insurance to some or all of their employees, or are too small to fall under the law. The beneficiaries: Citizens and legal residents who previously could not afford insurance, or were excluded because of pre-existing medical conditions.\nWhy it passed: The U.S. rate of uninsurance was chronically high \u2013 about one in six \u2013 before the law took effect, and many sick people were unable to get adequate medical attention. Hospital emergency rooms were often overwhelmed with patients who had no regular doctors or preventive care.\nHow it works: Employer coverage must be affordable: An employee\u2019s share of a single policy can be no more than 9.5 percent of his income. It must cover at least 60 percent, on average, of the group\u2019s medical expenses and provide such \u201cessential health benefits\u201d as inpatient hospital stays, ER trips, postnatal care, mental health, prescription drugs, pediatrics and free preventive services.\nSummary: Companies that use a subcontractor to supply workers are liable for labor law violations.\nWhom it affects: Workers hired by staffing or temp agencies and the businesses that use those agencies.\nWhy it passed: Hiring of contract workers has exploded in recent years into what\u2019s been dubbed \u201cthe perma-temp economy.\u201d One in five manual labor jobs are now temporary. Hotels, farms, construction firms, warehouses, retailers, and other companies have often been insulated from legal consequences when temp agencies fail to pay promised wages or compensate workers for injuries. The new law will reward \u201cthe use of responsible contractors, rather than a race to the bottom,\u201d according to the California Labor Federation.\nHow it works: Both sides are now liable \u2013 the \u201cclient employer\u201d as well as its third-party labor supplier \u2013 for payment of wages, accurate reporting of hours, benefits, tax deductions and insurance for victims of on-the-job injuries. The \u201cclient employer\u201d may not shift responsibility for workplace safety to the staffing agency. Companies with five or fewer temp workers, or with fewer than 25 employees overall, are exempt.\nSummary: Beginning July 1, California companies must provide at least three days a year of paid leave to ill workers.\nWhom it affects: All businesses, large and small. Part-time and temporary workers as well as full-timers. The law excludes 360,000 workers paid with government funds to provide in-home care for the low-income disabled and elderly.\nWhy it passed: Low-wage workers are often crippled by loss of pay when they must take time off to care for themselves or their families. As the California Catholic Conference noted, \u201cJust three unpaid days off can cost a family without access to paid sick days, on average, their entire monthly grocery budget.\u201d Nationwide, 39 percent of workers have no paid sick leave, including those in retail and restaurant jobs where they interact with the public. The California Medical Association called the law \u201ca public health strategy\u201d to avoid spreading disease.\nHow it works: Employees who work 30 or more days in a year may accrue paid sick leave at a rate of one hour per 30 hours worked. The employer may cap the leave at 24 hours per year. Workers may use sick days after 90 days of employment. They can use the leave to care for children and other sick family members.\nSummary: California agencies must compile an annual report naming employers with the most workers enrolled in Medi-Cal, the government-funded health care program for the poor.\nWhom it affects: The law is aimed in part at Walmart, which employs 80,000 Californians and has been the target of protests over the number of its workers on public assistance. Other retailers such as Target, along with large restaurant chains like Olive Garden and Cheesecake Factory, may also fall under the law. A UC Berkeley study found that big companies \u2013 those with more than 500 workers \u2013 employ more than 300,000 Californians who earn little enough to qualify for Medi-Cal.\nWhy it passed: As wages fail to keep up with inflation and employers cut back benefits, workers turn to government for health care subsidies. Medi-Cal now covers 32 percent of the state\u2019s population at an annual cost of $74 billion. \u201cLarge, profitable employers should pay wages and benefits that do not impoverish workers or shift costs onto taxpayers,\u201d Section 1 of the law declares. Some lawmakers have proposed penalties on large companies with many Medi-Cal-enrolled workers.\nHow it works: Beginning in January 2016, the Department of Finance will issue an annual publicly available report to the legislature listing the 500 employers with the most employees enrolled in Medi-Cal. The report would show the overall cost to the government of each company\u2019s publicly assisted workers. Employers will not have to submit data for the report. It will be compiled from existing state records.\nFor the full text of new laws, go to leginfo.legislature.ca.gov.<|endoftext|>Are EPC\u2019s are outdated and should they be scrapped?\nEPC\u2019s are outdated and do not support energy efficiency and low carbon heating measures. They should be replaced with Building Renovation Passports according to the Environmental Audit Committee, which is made up of MPs from all parties.\nAll this comes about from the Government\u2019s commitment to become net zero by 2050. Currently there are approximately 19million UK properties that would to be upgraded to meet the EPC band C. It is reported that on average it would cost \u00a318,000 per home to achieve this. This is a massive task and far greater than what was originally estimated.\nTo hit this task of net zero by 2050 it is being proposed that the government must front load schemes such as Home upgrade grants, social housing decarbonisation and phase two of the green homes grant to stimulate activity.\nThere are lots of recommendations from the committee, but the main focus will be on what support both financially and educationally the government can give to the industry to help this become a reality.\nIs the EPC outdated an impossible for people to hit?\nIs there a better way to ensure properties are being energy efficient?<|endoftext|>JAMBI REFERENCE BOOK is corporate entity registered with Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA), Singapore.

It is recommended to seek legal advice if in doubt as to the wording, appropriateness or legality of a proposed condition.\nNB: In particular, for a sanction to be effectively enforced sufficient evidence would be required to justify the claim or action. It is therefore important to have clear records for example of agreed service level, notice periods, reminders, communications, agreements etc.\nAny incentive or sanction must be enforced in compliance with the agreed terms and conditions of the contract or agreement.<|endoftext|>What is the divorce process in Texas?\na) Standing orders (IMPORTANT): Depending on where your lawsuit is filed, there may be standing orders for that county. These are actual court orders, signed by the presiding judges that are in effect immediately--for both parties--upon the filing of a lawsuit. It is very important that you read and understand the standing orders of your county. The courts will make you accountable for any violations of the standing orders, whether you were informed or not.\nb) Petition: The petition is the first pleading that is filed in a lawsuit. This is filed by the party who is starting the lawsuit. This document should be officially served on the other party and it will state the names of the parties, the type of lawsuit, and the various requests the suing party is asking for.\nA \"Waiver of Service\" is a document that the person who is being sued can sign before a notary, and it can then be filed with the court and will count as proof the person has been served. If you are being sued, be very careful about signing anything the suing party gives you. Some variations of waivers of service may contain statements that say you are giving permission to the court to go forth with trial without any notice to you. If you sign this and a trial takes place without you and orders are issued by a court that you think are unfair, it can be very difficult (if not impossible) to correct the situation. Always consult an attorney before signing a waiver of service.\nIf you have been sued, as the responding party you must file an \"Original Answer\" within 20 days of being served with a lawsuit. It is always advised that you consult an attorney when you have been sued. If you are unable to see an attorney within 20 days from the date you were served, you should draft a letter listing the cause number (the identification number found on the court document) of the suit that was filed, your name, address and phone number, and indicate that your document is your Original Answer. You should also state that you deny all that the suing party is requesting, and you demand that the suing party show proof for all they request. It is best to consult an attorney to make sure your rights are protected. If you are sued, you certainly will want to file an Original Answer immediately, but you may wish to file a countersuit as well. A countersuit can be used to reduce the amount of the original suit, or it may be a different claim.\nDivorces will take a minimum of 61 days, because the State of Texas has a minimum 60-day \"cooling off\" period. If the divorce is contested, it will likely take 4 to 7 months, on average. Once you file for divorce, you may need relief or a court order to provide you with assistance while the divorce is pending. In an Original Petition or Countersuit, either party or both may request that the court make temporary orders and setting a hearing is the way you will get the order unless an agreement can be made between parties. Courts may make orders for the following types of temporary relief: a) Custody: parties will likely be named Joint Managing Conservators, and rights and duties will designated to each party, including the right to determine the children's primary residence. b) Child support: child support will be ordered in most cases for the party who is maintaining the children's primary residence.\no All potential documentary exhibits and other evidence to support their case.\nYour attorney is best able to represent you when the documents are provided in a complete and organized fashion. A complete document file can be instrumental to negotiating and resolving divorce or custody case issues without litigation. Even more significantly, however, if settlement is not possible, your documents may be absolutely necessary to support your case at trial.\nOnce again, organization may help to reduce your legal fees.\nCollaborative Law is a newer concept when it comes to divorce. The idea behind collaborative law is that parties negotiate all aspects of the divorce, along with their lawyers. Hearings are not a part of Collaborative Law (although a final prove up hearing is required). This is a great idea for couples who want to make their own decisions without subjecting themselves to the uncertainties of"

        "passage": "aturally, the MCU has moved on from many of the characters it first presented in its early stages. However, Ant-Man remains a key component of Marvel\u2019s plans, and a third standalone film is about to be released. Of course, an exciting teaser for Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has already been published, and now fans could have just learnt how long the upcoming MCU film will go. According to Fandango, the latest Ant-Man instalment has a runtime of 2 hours and 5 minutes, making it by a very slim margin the longest Ant-Man film to date. Ant-Man and the Wasp ran for an hour and 58 minutes, while the first Ant-Man ran for an hour and 57 minutes.\nWith the hit Spider-Man: No Way Home, which had a runtime of 148 minutes, the situation with regard to the length of MCU films didn\u2019t get any better. Thor: Love and Thunder and Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness followed, both clocking in at relatively brief runs of 126 minutes and 119 minutes, respectively, in 2022. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, which lasted a whopping 161 minutes, completed Phase 4 after that.\nWith a runtime that, when compared to the MCU films fans have been treated to in recent years, may feel a touch on the short side, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania now launches Phase 5. But a shorter running length seems acceptable given where Ant-Man stands in relation to the larger Marvel universe. It would be absurd to make an Ant-Man movie the size of Wakanda Forever. Given the superhero weariness that some believe has already started to set in at the box office, it will be fascinating to watch if future MCU films likewise strive to keep things closer to the 120-minute mark.<|endoftext|>Hollie Mallet was going through her security footage when she noticed something unusual a little boy regularly sneaking into her garage to pet her dog.\nI wanted to find out who he was, Mallet said in an ABC News video.

Thanks and keep it up.\nHere's a minor tip. In your coverage, you must often refer to the site of the 2008 Olympics. For instance, in comparing how Michael Phelps is doing in London versus Beijing.\nYes, I know: place names and proper nouns never fare well when crossing language barriers. We don't say \"Venice\" or \"Paris\" the way their residents do; the Chinese pronounce the site of the 2000 Olympics as X\u012bn\u00ed.\nBut often these changes occur because the \"real\" foreign pronunciation is rare or awkward in your own language. It's the opposite this time. The right sound is closer to the familiar \"Jingle Bells\" one than to zh- style exotica. You can read more on the linguistics of the matter here.\nWhen I asked my in-house linguistics-and-Chinese-language expert why she thought American broadcasters liked saying Beizhing, she said that it was probably because people somehow felt that a foreign word should have a \"foreign\" pronunciation -- and because they've heard it that way so often. In fact, we heard it that way about 500 times on NBC today. Olympic announcers, you can make the difference! Just repeat to yourself, \"Bei-jingle bells, Bei-jingle bells, Bei-jingle all the way,\" and it will come naturally.<|endoftext|>In Philadelpia to see Tara, a friend and fellow artist I met in Seongnam 5 years ago, when we were both invited to show our artists\u2019 books at Seongnam Bookart Festival.\nTara is not only a wonderful host, she\u2019s also a skilled artist, a teacher and a book conservator, so Monday I met her at The Historical Society of Pennsylvania where she\u2019s in charge of the conservation of the books and documents.

One can not believe in a specific god, but still believe there is a god or gods, and be a deist. One can not believe in any specific god, and leave it at that, and be an atheist.\n\nFor instance, I am an atheist. I wouldn't say \"there is no god or gods\" because I don't necessarily believe that. I won't say otherwise either, because I have no reason to believe otherwise. I don't have sufficient evidence to make any sort of claim, so I don't. Because I don't believe in any god, I'm an atheist.\n\n[Not to be that guy, but for a reference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism)<|endoftext|>This case details a classroom-based research and development project facilitated with management approaches adapted from the software industry to the classroom, specifically a combination of the methods generally known as \u2018Scrum\u2019 and \u2018Agile\u2019.

For the oral acute toxicity test, Sprague-Dawley (SD) male and female rats were gavaged with two doses of D/DA (200 and 2,000 mg/kg body weight) and then observed for any toxic symptoms for 2 weeks. The LD$_{50}$ value for the rats was greater than 2,000 mg/kg body weight for both male and female rats, which indicates that there were no toxic symptoms induced by doses of up to 2,000 mg/kg body weight. For the subacute toxicity study, rats were treated with D/DA at doses of 2 and 20 mg/kg body weight once a day for 30 days. There were no significant changes in body weight and food intake observed during the subacute toxicity study. In addition, no differences were observed between the control and treated groups when urinalysis was conducted or when hematology and biochemical parameters were evaluated. Finally, histopathological examination of the organs did not reveal any lesions in the control or treated groups. Taken together, these findings indicate that D/DA is safe and non-toxic.\n(S)-(+)-3(3,4-dihydroxy-phenyl)-acrylic acid 2,2-dimethyl-8-oxo3,4-dihydro-2H,8H-pyrano[3,2-g]Chromen-3-yl-ester (Compound 6, C6) is synthesized from (S)-(+)-decursin and attenuates the pathophysiologic progression of asthma in a ovalbumin-induced asthmatic mouse model. In the present study, we examined the effect of C6 on spontaneous apoptosis of eosinophils and neutrophils of normal and asthmatic subjects. C6 increased the apoptosis of asthmatic eosinophils in a dose-dependent manner, but it inhibited neutrophil apoptosis. C6 has no effect on apoptosis of normal eosinophils and neutrophils. LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K, rottlerin, an inhibitor of $PKC{\\delta}$, Ro-31-8425, an inhibitor of classical PKC inhibitor, PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK, and BAY 11-7085, an inhibitor of NF-${\\kappa}B$, blocked the inhibitory effect on apoptosis of asthmatic neutrophils due to C6. These results indicate that C6 may be valuable as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of asthma.\nBackground: Angelica gigas Nakai, that belong to the Umbelliferae family, is one of the traditional medicinal plants in Korea. Its roots have been used to treat gynecological diseases. In this study, growth characteristics and index components were compared with the forest microclimate at several forest sites. Methods and Results: A. gigas was planted in three climatic zones according to the temperature (southern temperature zone - Hamyang, central temperature zone - Bonghwa, and northern temperature zone - Jeongseon) and growth characteristics were investigated in comparison with the forest microclimate. Our results indicated that the root diameter and length, and fresh and dry weight were the highest in Jeongseon. The total content of decursin was the highest in Jeongseon (9.52%), followed by those in Hamyang (8.07%) and Bonghwa (7.48%), respectively. Additionally, the yield of decursin (1.39 g) was the highest in Jeongseon. Conclusions: The yield and index components were influenced by the microclimate in the forests, and it was assumed that high altitude and low temperature affected the increase in growth and index components. These results will be useful as basic data to study the correlation among environmental conditions, growth, and index components.\nBackground: Angelica gigas Nakai is a perennial herb belonging to the family Umbelliferae. Its roots are utilized in traditional medicine. The aim of this study was to increase the yield of and the content of two indicator components (decursin and decursinol angelate) in A. gigas Nakai. Methods and Results: The roots of A. gigas Nakai were harvested 4-times from late August to late October in 2017. Two agents (trace element-TE, and plant hormone-HM) were applied 4 times at intervals of 2 weeks. The content of the two indicator components were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. The HM treatment showed the greatest increase in underground part yield and root diameter. The content of the two indicator components in the control (non-treatment) group was the highest in the underground part, but was higher in the aerial parts in the agent treatment group. After treatment with the agents, the content of the indicator components tended to decrease in the underground part. However, the total content of the indicator components in the two agent treatment groups exceeded the level of 6% set by the Korean Pharmacopoeia. Conclusions: The highest underground part yield was found in the HM treatment group, while the highest content of decursin and decursinol angelate were found in the control group. This study provides basic information for yield improvement in A. gigas.\nAngelica gigas Nakai (Korean danggui), a member of the Umbelliferae family, is a Korean traditional medicinal plant whose roots have been used for treating gynecological diseases. In this study, the growth characteristics and decursin contents of Angelica gigas Nakai were compared according to the difference of cultivation area. As a result, the root diameter of A. gigas Nakai was the highest in the Duil-ri, and the number of the root of A. gigas was the highest in Topdong-ri. The fresh weight and dry weight of Angelica gigas Nakai was the highest in the Topdong-ri. The soil properties of cultivation area was Sandy Clay Loam and the content of organic matter was the highest in Topdong-ri. The total content of decursin was 5.31% the highest in Duil-ri. And 4."

The fault surface can be vertical, horizontal, or at some angle to the surface of the earth. Add your answer and earn points. Normal faults are fault lines where the crust moves apart along the fault line, creating a void in between. 6.4. So when page fault occurs then following sequence of events happens : The computer hardware traps to the kernel and program counter (PC) is saved on the stack. Deformation may be largely restricted to the sedimentary cover sequence detached from the underlying crystalline basement (\u201cthin-skinned\u201d thrusting) or may actively involve the basement underlying the cover sequence (\u201cthick-skinned\u201d thrusting); the latter commonly involves compressional reactivation of basement-penetrating normal faults inherited from previous crustal extension. Current instruction state information is saved in CPU registers. These are fault-bend folds (Fig. The fault shows drag folding. Ok, so let\u2019s start with the basics. TG, Taebaek Group; YG, Yeongwol Group; BF, Bansong Formation. The thrusting was largely directed from west to east, with the frontal structures climbing up into strata of the foreland basin. a. upward b. downward c. horizontally d. stays the same. 7 years ago. However, thrusts rarely cut smoothly upsection. Thrust faulting likewise dominates the foreland and hinterland flanks of collision orogens. Strike-slip fault, in geology, a fracture in the rocks of Earth\u2019s crust in which the rock masses slip past one another parallel to the strike. Reverse fault scarps are often difficult to locate precisely due to widespread landslides which cover the fault trace. those that are physically linked, or hard-linked, to others) can have displacement contours that are either locally sub-parallel to the branch-line along which the throw is low or zero (Fig. The hanging wall occurs above the fault plane and the footwall occurs below it. Cowie and Scholz, 1992, McGrath and Davison, 1995). Dahlstrom coined the term \u2018duplex\u2019 for these buried systems, where imbricate thrusts entirely enclose slices of rock (termed \u2018horses\u2019) and recombine up-dip onto an upper detachment (\u2018roof thrust\u2019). Idealized representation of a fold-thrust system, illustrating the differences between emergent and buried systems. A reverse fault occurs primarily across lithological units whereas a thrust usually occurs within or at a low angle to lithological units.

Fault bend and fault propagation folds associated with a \u201cstaircase\u201d thrust system in layered crust (after McClay, 1992). Up-and-down motions in earthquakes occur over so-called \"dip-slip\" faults, where the ground above the fault zone either drops (a normal fault) or is pushed up (a reverse fault). Manuel Berberian, in Developments in Earth Surface Processes, 2014. It is also called Line-to-line fault. James A. Jackson, in International Geophysics, 2002, Earthquakes on active thrust and reverse faults on the continents show a much wider range of dips than do active normal faults. Table 15.5. Regardless of these uncertainties, which are typical for thrust belts formed on the edge of mountain ranges, the cross-section illustrates how considerable structural complexity can consist of individually rather simple elements \u2013 thrusts climbing staircases through strata and the stacking up imbricate slices. Below these depths, rocks are probably too warm for faults to \u2026 Figure 3.39. We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads. If you imagine undoing the motion of a reverse fault, you will undo the compression and thus lengthen the horizontal distance between two points on either side of the fault. Reverse Faults results from COMPRESSION forces that squeeze rock. TRUE OR FALSE? In a Reverse Fault, the hanging wall moves upwards relative to the foot wall. It occurs when two conductors are short circuited. In these examples, although the deformation in sediments at shallow depths is probably not connected to the basement by through-going faults, it is misleading to think of the system as \u201cthin-skinned\u201d in the same sense as it was in the Rockies or Appalachians, as the basement beneath the sediments is clearly deforming as well.

The province is also crossed by the 145-km-long Military Demarcation Line (MDL), which starts at 38\u00b045' north latitude, in Hyeonnae-myeon in Goseong-gun to the southwest, to a site at 38\u00b020' north latitude linking Hyangnobong Peak, Mondong-ri and Gimhwa-eup. Gangwon-do is 150 km wide, from east to west, and 243 km long, from north to south, and has an eastern coastline of about 314 km. The province is bordered by five provinces, three cities and 13 counties, including Singye-gun and Gimcheon-gun in Hwanghae-do; Yeoncheon, Pocheon, Gapyeong, Yangpyeong and Yeoju in Gyeonggi-do in the east; Chungju-si, Jecheon-si and Danyang-gun in Chungcheongbuk-do and Yeongju-si, Bonghwa-gun and Uljin-gun in Gyeongsangbuk-do in the south; and Anbyeon-gun and Deogwon-gun in Hamgyeongnam-do and Goksan-gun in Hwanghae-do in the north.\nThe total area of Gangwon-do is 20,569Km\u00b2 of which the area south of the MDL is 16,873.51\u33a2, which accounts for 82% of the province's total area and 16.8% of the national territory of South Korea.\nThe total area of Gangwon-do is 20,569Km\u00b2 of which the area south of the MDL is 16,873.51\u33a2, which accounts for 82% of the province's total area and 16.8% of the national territory of South Korea. The province consists of the mountainous areas covering 81.0% of the total provincial area, including 13,665.66Km\u00b2 and farming fields of 1,668.69Km\u00b2, which accounts for 9.9%, and land for other purposes covering 9.1% of the total area, with 1,539.25Km\u00b2.\nGangwon-do is a mountainous province, (a much greater part is occupied by mountains)and is usually divided into two areas, Yeongdong and Yeongseo, with the Taebaek Mountains, which form the backbone of the Korean Peninsula, in the middle.\nThe area east of the Taebaek Mountains is marked by steep slopes with few coastal plains, while the western area is marked by gentle slopes and mountains containing the headwaters of some of Korea's largest rivers, such as the Namhan and Bukhan Rivers.\nThe percentage of low land (less than 100 meters high) covers only 5.6% of the total area of Gangwon-do, which is even lower than that of Hamgyeongnam-do where the figure is 9.6%. Low hills between 100-500 meters in height cover 43.1%; mid-height land between 500-1,000 meters covers 43.4%, a larger figure than for all the other provinces in Korea; and, finally, highlands taller than 1,000 meters cover 7.7%. Flat, arable land for paddy cultivation is largely located along the eastern coastal area around Gangneung and Bukpyeong and is distributed around Cheorwon, Chuncheon and Wonju in the Yeongbuk area. The northern part of the river basins feature steep valleys.\nThe Yeongdong area is geographically narrow due to the steep mountains facing the East Sea, but it contains several high scenic passes, such as Daegwallyeong, Misiryeong, Jinburyeong and Hangyeryeong, and deep valleys. The Yeongseo area features mountains and sunken lands all running gently towards Seoul and surrounding Gyeonggi-do in the west, and expansive highlands that offer dry fields rather than paddies and contain headwaters that flow into many streams and two of Korea's largest rivers, the Han River and Nakdong River, that wet a large part of the Korean Peninsula. The upper streams of the Bukhan River provide habitats for various fish species, including some of the rarest Korean native fish, and form well protected healthy ecosystems. There are in the area several famous dams: the Peace Dam, Hwacheon Dam, Chuncheon Dam, Soyang River Dam and Uiam Dam that supply an ample amount of water for Korean industries and daily life.\nGangwon-do is located in the medium-latitude temperate zone between 37\u00b0 and 38\u00b0 north latitude.\nLocated in the medium-latitude temperate zone between 37\u00b0 and 38\u00b0 north latitude, Gangwon-do's climate is characterized by high temperatures and humidity during the summer and coldness and dryness in the winter. This is due to the high continental pressure which is low in temperature and humidity.\nGangwon-do is geographically divided into two areas, Yeongdong and Yeongseo, by the Taebaek Mountains as they stretch from north to south along the east of the Korean Peninsula. Both areas feature remarkably different climatic conditions.\nAs for the general characteristics of the province's climate, the Yeongdong area, in which steep mountain slopes are directly connected with the coasts, displays elements of an oceanic climate whereas the Yeongseo area, located in the middle of the Korean Peninsula, shows characteristic elements comparable to those of a continental climate. Meanwhile, the highlands of the Taebaek Mountains exhibit characteristic features of a mountain climate.\nThe Yeongdong area has a few paddy fields because of the steep mountain slopes running downwards and directly into the sea, thus leaving only a limited area of paddy fields lying along some parts of the coastline. Such geographical features of the area create a comparatively warmer winter and cooler summer, with a low annual temperature range.\nThe annual mean temperature in the Yeongdong area is higher than that of the Yeongseo area by 2\u00b0 C. The annual precipitation rates in the two areas are 2,058.5mm and 1,690.3mm, respectively, showing that Gangwon-do's eastern part, including Gangneung, Sokcho and Samcheok, has more rainfall (by about 370 mm annually) than the western part, which includes Chuncheon, Wonju and Cheorwon. In the winter and spring the province tends to have stronger winds than in other provinces. There is also more snow in winter. In January and February the Yeongdong area, in particular, tends to have a much heavier snowfall than the rest of the entire country.<|endoftext|>SciVal solution trial access is open at TalTech until 30th November 2018.\nAccess is granted from TalTech`s IP addresses, but in order to log-in you have to create an account with SciVal according to the guidelines.\nIf you have already an account for accessing Scopus, ScienceDirect or Mendeley \u2013 it will work here as well.\nSciVal enables you to visualize research performance, benchmark relative to peers, develop collaborative partnerships and analyze research trends.

        "passage": "iating its was wonderful vista.\nThe scenery from the Observatory was next of my favorite because of the overlooking view I had while I was there which allowed me to peek the whole village itself.\nWe did walked around the village because we wanted to see as much as we can with so little time that we had, we still bought the ticket even we knew most of the shows were finished.\nBefore reaching the top most area of Observatory, we have to climb a little so we got a chance to observed what the village look like from the top.\nIn summary, all of us enjoyed the village because of its colorful place that offered visitors with great atmosphere, fun and exciting experience. We were aware that other buildings offers a lot of things that we still haven\u2019t seen yet but because the village is closing, we never witness other exciting stuff. As for what we had seen so far, we were already satisfied in the village. If I will be given another chance to come back to this village I will spend one day of it so I can watch other shows and see other exhibits available in the place.\nWhen South Korean drama entitled Winter Sonata was aired in my country, more than 10 years ago, the drama has been hit to the TV viewers maybe because Filipinos can relate to the story as it depicts love and life story which can happen to anyone. I never watched Korean Drama before but when Winter Sonata started airing in my country, I was curious why a lot of my countrymen watch it. I tried to tune once and I watched it again and again. The said drama is one of the non-historical drama that I knew by heart, main reason aside from the story was because of the main actor Bae Yong Joon. I was a fan of him.\nAside from historical places that I wanted to visit in South Korea, we did a side trip in few places where some of the famous drama was held. One of the place was Nami Island (or Namiseom) where some of remarkable scenes of Winter Sonata series which remembered by the viewers. For what I learned, the island become a tourist destination in South Korea because of the said drama.\nWhen we arrived in the island, I never expect historical information to discover, but I did learned something. The island was named after General Nami, who died because he was falsely accused of treason during the reign of King Sejo. At the island, I read some information about the said General and it seems that the treason case against him was removed during King Sunjo (son of King Jeongjo / Yi San). That piece of history is quite interesting to know.\nFrom our hotel we took Line 7 again and started our journey from Nonh-yeon station to Sangbong. There was a comedy experience we did, as we understood instructions incorrectly and from Sangbong, we went out in Mangu station as we thought we need to transfer the train going to Gyeongchun, but to our discovery, the train in Sangbong also goes to the station we intended to do, we did an unnecessary switching of train. Well that was one of our moments of experience to laugh at while touring in South Korea.\nAfter we took train in Mangu station, it was almost an hour before we reached Gapyeong station. During that travel, I just realised how far the scope of Seoul Metro Train. Because for me Gapyeong station distance is really far from metro. And I also witnessed along the train line the residential buildings besides hills and mountains which made me feel awe for what I saw. I can sense Seoul was not enough to accommodate South Korean metropolis that is why residential buildings are nowadays can be seen even its far in Seoul.\nWe went out in Gapyeong station and from there I found some tourist brochure to know more about how we can go to Nami Island. There is a regular bus that goes through all tourist spot in Gapyeong area. But we still decided to take a cab as we have limited time to visit all the places that the bus is offering. After taking a cab, we just surprised that terminal to Nami Island was just nearby, since it is near from the train station, the fee was minimal and we had saved time.\nWe walked to the terminal and some people probably recognised that we are Filipinos and they greeted us in our language which made us feel at home. We bought our ticket and then walked to the docking area or what they call Gapyeong Wharf where the ferry that will bring us to the island was waiting.\nWhile waiting for the ferry to leave the terminal, we saw a zip line tower (Zip Wire Tower) which is another option to go to the island instead of a boat. Since we already bought tickets, we don\u2019t have a choice to cancel the trip even my sister and I wanted to try zip line.\nWe enjoyed the trip and in few minutes we arrived at Nami Wharf is Nami Island. People started to disembark the ferry and we did the same. Near the entrance gate, there were information centre, restaurants and other stores to enjoy. We started our walk in the island park. First, we passed the Tourism Bureau. Next thing we saw was the Tomb of General Nami. We walked along the famous Central Korean Pine Lane where there are lanterns hang on one side. Along the lane we also found different flags and we found my country\u2019s own flag.\nAnd from the said lane, we either turn left or right to see more of different things in the island park. First stop was at the Ostrich Fence. Then, the nearby site of Yeoncheon Jeongok-ri Site.\nNext thing we saw was the famous Winter Sonata First Kiss site which showcase the bench used of the main character of the drama where the first kiss happened. Then it was followed by the First Kiss Bridge where you can see the Glass Sequoia, Eco Farm and Yeonryeon Pond.\nWe continued our wandering in the island park until we were back in Korean Central Pine Lane. Then we saw the UNICEF Sharing Stage and UNICEF Hall. Next to the area were restaurants, galleries and stores. Next stage we saw was Youth Stage Belgrade.\nWe stopped for a while to take a break near at the playground. Then after the lunch, we walked to the famous film site of Winter Sonata which called the Metasequoia Lane. Here we saw different stuff related to the drama such as the huge photo of the main character along the Metasequoia Lane, their statues, bicycle used in the shooting and event the woods were also displayed. There is Winter Sonata store as well. Every romantic moments in the drama has been showcased.\nAfter enjoying the Winter Sonata Site, we started to walked back from where we came from as we still plan to visit another drama site near the island. We walked in the same lane that we took while enjoying the island park.<|endoftext|>Do I need to request a course extension if I am an international student transferring to a different course?\nIf you have applied for a course transfer and are successful, then you will receive a new offer letter and contract, which you need to accept and return if you wish to commence in the new course.

        "passage": " that management works first and foremost for shareholders. While such a view is overwhelmingly favored by independent experts in corporate governance, it is by no means without some legal, management and even some academic dissent. The alternative view is stakeholder centric - that management must consider the well being of all of its stakeholders when making decisions. Stakeholders other than shareholders include employees, bondholders, customers, and even the community in which a firm operates.\nStakeholder centric requirements in the United States vary with State Law and Corporate Charters. Different countries around the world take different viewpoints with some (Ireland) being more shareholder friendly and others (The Netherlands) being more stakeholder centric.\nFirst, companies that could be run more efficiently under new management are protected under existing management. It can be cost advantageous - and beneficial to society as a whole to have the company acquired. In some cases it is beneficial to society as a whole to lay off employees and focus the company in more efficient ways. Companies protecting employees may resist such change.\nTo be sure, communities can be harmed when companies close plants, lay off employees and perhaps move their location. But community or state or country protectionism is harmful in the long run. Subsidizing inefficient operations may prolong the inevitable, but it avoids the obvious - uncompetitive companies will ultimately die and shareholders and ultimately all stakeholders will suffer. Protectionism and cross-subsidization will ultimately fail. The employees, companies and communities that thrive are those that embrace change and continually adapt - keeping themselves competitive in a global marketplace.\nSecond, situations that can benefit shareholders - the residual claimants in a company can be rejected. Not only is this unfair to the owners of a company, it is again ultimately destructive. Few investors would invest in a company that doesn't look out for their own best interests.\nTo be clear, stakeholders are important and they deserve every consideration by management. Even under a shareholder centric view, the best companies are conscious of the needs and obligations of their stakeholders and fulfill these claims in consideration of the competitive marketplace. Usually the claims of stakeholders are also defended by other means including contracts, union, and laws. Shareholders are not provided the same contractual certainties that stakeholders enjoy. They are the residual claimant of a firm's profits. They are entitled to everything that is left after all other expenses and claims have been paid - if there is anything left. Shareholders are not guaranteed a profit, but have the benefit of knowing management and the board are looking out for their best interests.\nThird, boards that take a stakeholder centric approach are answering to more than one master - not an optimal situation. It is never clear whose interests should be pursued or which direction to follow. The typical result is stagnation.\nTo be sure, laws that permit boards to reject takeovers based on stakeholder theory can also insulate management from needed change.\nThus, Mylan's shareholders have lost the opportunity to sell their shares at a substantial premium. Share prices fell 14%.<|endoftext|>Cuba will participate for the second consecutive year in the Can-Am Baseball League, based in Canada, a tournament in which for the third season its clubs will face foreign teams during the regular stage.\nMiles Wolff, Can-Am commissioner, announced that this year the contest will take place from June 8 to 29 and will include the six usual squads of the league plus the Cuban national team and the Yeoncheon Miracle, an independent club from South Korea.\nWe hope to welcome the Cuban side to Canada and the United States, and this year we will also see a South Korean team for the first time, said the executive.\nThe squad from the Caribbean Island will make its second raid in that event, after having last year a balance of 11 wins and 9 losses, according the digital site www.radiohc.cu.\nOn that occasion, the Cuban side included in its roster 13 players who are currently part of the team to attend the 4th World Baseball Classic (WBC), which starts on March 6 in Seoul, South Korea.\nThey are catchers Osvaldo V\u00e1zquez and Yosvani Alarc\u00f3n, as well as infielders Guillermo Avil\u00e9s and Jefferson Delgado.<|endoftext|>The evergreen beauty of Pakistan Ayesha Omer has been working in the fraternity for a number of years and stealing millions of hearts with her looks.\nShe has consistently appeared in some of the highest Pakistani grossing movies and dramas and people just couldn\u2019t stop adoring her.\nRecently, the actress was honored with Tamgha-e-Fakhr-e-Pakistan\u201d and the \u201cGlobal Women\u2019s Award\u201d from the Warsi International Foundation for her hard work and efforts in the past 10 years and her contribution to the progress of the Pakistani television/media/film industry.\nI hope I can continue to do my country proud, internally and internationally.

It did not specify what military measures it would take.\nPresident Park Geun-hye convened an emergency meeting of the National Security Council at the Blue House at around 6 p.m. to discuss the North\u2019s latest provocation.\nThe suspected projectile from the North is thought to have been aimed at speakers that have been blaring propaganda broadcasts. The military resumed psychological warfare in retaliation for recent land mine blasts in the demilitarized zone that maimed two patrol soldiers.\nThe North protested the resumption of the broadcasts and vowed to strike the loudspeakers. It has been reported that the North Korean army was beefing up its offensive posture along the borderline in recent days.\nThe North\u2019s suspected firing across the border on Thursday marked the first such action in almost five years since it shelled South Korea\u2019s western-most Yeonpyeong Island, Gyeonggi, in November 2010, killing two Marines and two civilians.\nA military source said while further analysis into the suspected shell would be conducted, it was likely to have been a 122-milimeter rocket.<|endoftext|>can deliver products faster and more efficiently than ever before.\nBuild your career with a company that develops and appreciates ambition.\nWe\u2019re growing fast, with great brand recognition, supporting regional and national customers throughout the United States.\nJ.W.

A dietitian or nutritionist can also help you assess your diet and make necessary changes.\nA new study has found that dieters may overestimate the healthiness of their eating habits. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Arizona, looked at a group of participants who were trying to lose weight. The participants were asked to rate the healthfulness of their diet on a scale of 1 to 10. The researchers found that the participants who rated their diet as being healthy were more likely to be overweight or obese than those who rated their diet as being unhealthy.\nThe study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Amy Loughridge, said that the findings suggest that dieters may need to be more honest with themselves about the healthfulness of their diet. \u201cIf you\u2019re not being honest with yourself about how healthy your diet really is, you\u2019re not going to be able to make the changes you need to make in order to lose weight,\u201d she said.\nThe study\u2019s authors say that the findings could have implications for public health messages about diet and weight loss. They say that public health messages should avoid giving dieters the impression that their eating habits are healthier than they actually are.<|endoftext|>Material \u3002 \u2764 Necklace Type:Pendant Necklaces, Gender\u3002\u2764 is_customized:No. Gender \u3002 \u2764 is_customized:No. Chain material \u3002 \u3002 \u3002.

PACITO GARCES JR., Accused-Appellant.\nPacito Garces Jr., also known as \"Bolingot,\" appeals the Decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Dumaguete City (Branch 32), which convicted him of rape and sentenced him to reclusion perpetua.\nIn a Complaint dated May 16, 1995, Rosalie Ganaganag charged herein appellant with rape. During the preliminary investigation, he failed to appear or to adduce any evidence for his defense. Finding sufficient ground to establish a well-founded belief that he had committed the crime, Circuit Trial Judge Tirso F. Banquerigo subsequently forwarded the records to the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor. Because appellant had escaped from the Municipal Jail of Jimalalud, Negros Oriental, warrants 1 for his re-arrest were also issued.\n\"That on or about 11:30 o\u2019clock in the morning of May 14, 1995, at Barangay Bangcal, Jimalalud, Negros Oriental, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with the use of a deadly weapon and by using force and intimidation, did then and there wil[l]fully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of one Rosalie 3 Ganaganag, against her will, to the damage and prejudice of herein offended party.\nAn [a]ct defined and penalized by Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.\nAttached herewith to form an integral part hereof is the Criminal Complaint dated May 16, 1995, signed by complainant Rosalie Ganaganag.\n\"WHEREFORE, premised considered, the court finds accused PACITO GARCES JR., A.K.A.\u2019BOLINGOT\u2019 GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of RAPE penalized under Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to R.A. 7659 and hereby sentences him to the penalty of reclusion perpetua together with all the accessory penalties provided for by law, to pay offended party Rosalie Ganaganag the sum of P200,000.00 as moral damages, and to pay the costs.\n\"At about 11:30 o\u2019clock in the morning of May 14, 1995, private complainant Rosalie Ganaganag was left alone in their house while her parents Santiago and Amparo Ganaganag went to the market in the poblacion of Jimalalud, Negros Oriental. Appellant Pacito Garces, Jr., also known as Bolingot, barged into the house of private complainant and embraced her. Suddenly, he poked a knife at her chest and forced her to lie on the ground. Appellant then went on top of private complainant, raised her skirt and removed her underwear. After appellant succeeded in having sexual intercourse with private complainant, he threatened to kill her and her family if she would report the incident to anyone.\n\"Thereafter, private complainant proceeded to the house of their neighbor Pacita Garces. Private complainant approached Pacita, hugged her and cried after telling that she was raped by appellant. Pacita noticed that the hair of private complainant was disheveled. She also noted a scratch caused by two fingernails at the lower part of the cheek of private complainant.\n\"Pacita and private complainant went to the house of Barangay Councilor Wilson Garces to whom private complainant reported in tears that she was raped by appellant. Wilson Garces noted that \u2018at the time her hair [was] disheveled.\u2019 He also \u2018saw some hematoma around her mouth.\u2019 Wilson accompanied Pacita and private complainant to Barangay Captain Felicito Torres.\nIn disposing of this case against the appellant, we shall consider the following issues: the sufficiency of the prosecution evidence and the proper damages.\nQ\tNow, on May 14, 1995, at about 11:00 o\u2019clock in the morning, can you please tell us where you were on that date and time?\nA\tI was in our house.\nQ\tWho was you[r] companion in your house in Bangcal, Jimalalud on May 14, 1995, at about 11:30 in the morning?\nA\tI was alone.\nQ\tHow about your parents, where were they at that time?\nA\tThey were in the poblacion of Jimalalud because that was a Saturday.\nQ\tCan you recall if there was an unusual incident that happened on May 14, 1995, at about 11:30 in the morning?\nQ\tAnd what was this unusual incident which you said you can remember?\nQ\tWhen you said Pacito Garces, Jr., you are referring to Pacito Garces, Jr. also known as Bolingot in this case?\nQ\tYou said that you were raped by Pacito Garces, Jr. also known as Bolingot, the accused in this case on May 14, 1995, at about 11:30 o\u2019clock in the morning[;] where did this incident happen?\nA\tIn our Barangay.\nQ\tYes, but you did not get my question[;] in your residence?\n\nA\tHe hugged me upstairs, and while he was carrying a knife he ga[gg]ed my mouth then covered it with a cloth"

A lot of houses created on a crawl room structure are experiencing wetness concerns. These crawl areas consist of the consolidated waste products of human beings as well as pets that have actually been living in close proximity with each other for many years without any approach of ventilation. Additionally, these areas sustain really reduced levels of temperatures, even in summertime, as a result of building restrictions as well as the visibility of insulation. This develops a breeding ground for the growth of microbial microorganisms that release hazardous spores and can cause severe illness for people that occupy these areas often. Thankfully, there are several approaches for encapsulating a crawl room that includes using plastic sheets, fiberglass fit together, paperboard, or sheathing, which all use various approaches for providing an extra layer of insulation and waterproofing against moisture and the development of mildew as well as mold. While these numerous products might be utilized successfully in securing as well as encapsulating various parts of the crawl room, wood rot is one location that has actually proven to be immune to many products. Wood rot is caused by the degeneration of the cellulose product that creates the base of the roof covering and also wall surfaces in crawl areas. Sealing and also enveloping this area will prevent moisture as well as the growth of mold while protecting against the growth of microorganisms that generate foul odors and are dangerous for the owners. Properly enveloping a crawl space will additionally enhance indoor air quality due to the fact that it allows entraped heat as well as moisture to escape through the encapsulated wall surfaces and flooring.  If the air top quality in a residence is poor, it can have a destructive result on health and wellness and also the immune system. It can also add to inadequate power performance by triggering temperature control issues and extreme humidity. Encapsulation considerably improves indoor air high quality as well as is an essential step for minimizing the amount of time needed to cool a home in the summertime as well as to make sure comfortable indoor air top quality throughout the year. Furthermore, encapsulatiing a crawl area secures the passengers from numerous types of accident and also building damages. As an example, if damp conditions are found in a residence, such as pipes or showers listed below the ground level, enveloping the location will protect against extreme damage from occurring. Water leaking into the crawl room can allow germs, mildew, and mold to expand unattended. Additionally, the presence of wet or wet conditions in a home increases the chance of the existence of rodents, bugs, as well as other bugs that can be hazardous to wellness. In order to secure their wellness and also the health and wellness of their family, homeowners ought to make certain that crawl space encapsulation is done. One more benefit of enveloping a crawl room is that it will offer the essential security for insulation within the area. Lots of houses that do not have this kind of securing done will ultimately require insulation. Nevertheless, the visibility of wet dirt or condensation on pipes and also ductwork can make insulation work more difficult in these locations. On top of that, the existence of mold and mildew or mold on insulation product can create the product to degrade gradually, making repair work required. An expert firm needs to be sought advice from if a house owner begins to observe problems with their heating and cooling as a result of creep area encapsulation. A foundation wall surface is frequently the initial point of call in between the outdoors setting as well as the home\u2019s foundation. Foundation wall surfaces are typically the first factor of water call, and also they should be sealed against the entry of excess moisture, in addition to against the entry of possible insect problem as well as mold and mildew development. Regrettably, the visibility of a wet crawl space or basement might create the requirement for added structure wall surface fixings. When this occurs, the home owner might also need to consult with a crawl room fixing expert to identify what alternatives might be offered to them because of their crawl space encapsulation.

Our artisans study and create works from nearly every type of craft from the Middle Ages. Collectively, we call the study of the various production, research, and performing crafts, \"arts and sciences.\" At many Society events, you will be able to watch artisans recreating these crafts and often take classes and workshops where you can learn to do them yourself. Some of our events are entirely dedicated to demonstrating and learning medieval crafts!\nConstruction crafts play a big role in our activities. Many of the pieces of armor that you see our combatants wearing were handcrafted by those same combatants or other artisans in the Society and the handiwork of the construction crafts adorn nearly every facet of Society life.\nLeathercraft is a very common activity, both those projects that end up in completed pieces of armor and other more artistic endeavors such as leather costume components, pouches, and other accessories.\nMetalwork and casting are also common crafting pursuits, from the platesmithing and mailsmithing that results in metal armor to beautifully cast jewelry and coins made of pewter and silver to ornate coronets and crowns worn by our nobility.\nWoodwork in the Society creates a multitude of useful and beautiful items, from simple and functional chairs and boxes to hand-tooled medallions and signs, to intricately fashioned thrones and even full castle facades and buildings.\nMany Society members explore a varied list of sciences as they recreate the Middle Ages. These sciences include botany, astronomy, stillroom crafts, cartography, siege engineering and physics, mathematics, languages, and many more. Some of the most fascinating classes and workshops found at Society events are on topics as varied as charting the heavens with an astrolabe to creating your own tallow candles.\nThe fine arts and more are also well represented in the SCA. Many Society members take up painting and drawing as their chosen pursuit and produce beautiful works of art from Renaissance-style portraits to triptychs portraying medieval life. Members study stained glass and glassblowing, sculpture, wirework, and more as they recreate every aspect of the Middle Ages.\nThere are literally hundreds of arts and sciences you could take up in the SCA. Even more than watching others perform these crafts, the highest importance is placed on sharing the knowledge behind them with others who want to learn. If you see someone doing or working on something that interests you, just ask!\nIf you're interested in learning more about crafting activities or trying them out, contact the Arts and Sciences Officer of your nearest branch to find out when and where classes and workshops are held!<|endoftext|>Owning a business is a beautiful dance while juggling lop-sided chainsaws and bowling pins engulfed in flames. It\u2019s a spectacle for sure, but keeping your head (literally and figuratively) requires a special art. And artists are only as good as their paintbrushes.\nEvery good business owner needs a good computer. It\u2019s the tool that\u2019ll keep track of your accounting, schedule, and system of operations. Businesses, tiny or grandiose, need a proper computer.\nFor those firms that are striving for growth, this is how you choose your small business computer.\nFirst thing\u2019s first: are you always on the move or chained to a desk?\nThere are two types of business computers. There\u2019s the laptop, and there is this desktop computer. Both have achieve similar functionality, but one offers mobility.\nLaptops are for the business owners that travel a lot or operate from different locations. It\u2019s very useful for entrepreneurs that freelance or go from city to city.\nDesktops are bulky, but they\u2019re powerhouses. It\u2019s not feasible to tote these daily; they\u2019re heavy and require an external monitor.\nDesktops trade off mobility for their sheer power. Components in desktops are vastly superior to those in laptops, and thus, they require a big case.\nGet a desktop if you need the power: accounting firms, video editors, CAD designers. Opt for a laptop if you can work from anywhere: writers, web developers, photographers.\nThis part might be intimidating, but the parts inside of a computer aren\u2019t complex. At least, not their purpose.\nThe CPU is an acronym for the central processing unit. There are two predominant processor manufacturers \u2013 Intel and AMD. Intel being the most prominent.\nProcessors should be rated 2.0GHz to 4.5GHz. The higher, the more powerful. Depending on your tasks, it\u2019s recommended to get anything above a dual-core CPU (the Intel i5 or i7 or the AMD Ryzen 5 or 7).\nNext is memory. It\u2019s not used to store data, but temporarily cache program data. Memory (or RAM) keeps background processes running.\nWe\u2019d recommend 8GB of RAM or more.\nStorage is what stores data. This is where files and programs are downloaded and installed. There are two types: SSD and HHD.\nAn SSD is superior, but more expensive. Get a drive at least 1TB in capacity.\nA GPU is a graphics processing unit. It\u2019s mainly used for gaming, so unless you\u2019re developing games, an integrated GPU is fine.\nWhich OS for Your Small Business Computer?\nThere are three operating systems that are typically used. There\u2019s Windows, MacOS, and Linux.\nWindows is used vastly in business and personal use. MacOS, Apple\u2019s proprietary UNIX distro, is great for creative firms. Linux OS is a tool used by software developers.\nYou should install an operating system based on those guidelines. Or purchase an Apple product.\nWindows is far and beyond the most popular computer OS. To get the best range of compatibility, Windows is suggested.\nBut be careful. The wide pool of computers operating on Windows is enticing for malicious attacks. Hackers develop harmful software mainly for Windows because of this.\nSmall businesses need computers to function and streamline their growth. It\u2019s tough juggling everything with an analog system. Upgrade it with a small business computer.\nGet a computer based on your mobility. The computer should also have an OS that suits your firm\u2019s business. Pick the computer with the most powerful parts.\nCheck out the others posts on business cybernetics.<|endoftext|>Andrew Kim Jong-han, better known as \u2018Gye-won` among Catholics, was born in Solmoe, Myeoncheon, Chungcheong-do (now, Songsan-ri, Ugang-myeon, Dangjin-gun, Chungnam). In his family register his name was recorded as `Hanhyeon.` He was the son of Pius Kim Jin-hu who was martyred in 1814, the father of St. Teresa Kim, and the granduncle of St. Andrew Kim Dae-geon, the first Korean priest who died a martyr in 1846.\nA few years after the Catholic Church was introduced into Korea, Andrew Kim Jong-han learned the catechism from his elder brother and became a Catholic. Prior to that his elder brother had become a Catholic with the help of Louis Gonzaga Yi Jon-chang, whom people called the `Apostle of Naepo` and proclaimed the Good News to his family.

This makes Korean beauty products quite overwhelming. This serum is probably already well-known to many people who adore Korean skin care products, but due to my hectic schedule, I\u2019ve only had the chance to evaluate it now.\nYuja Niacin Serum from Some by mi, is a serum which contains Yuzu extract and niacinamide to diminish the appearance of blemishes in just 30 days. According to them, they only use Yuja (citron) sourced from the clean and natural area of Goheung, Korea from where warm sunlight and fresh breeze from the sea can be found.\nWhat is Yuja?\nAccording to wikipedia, Yuja is a citrus fruit and plant in the family Rutaceae of East Asian origin. It is believed to have originated in central China as a hybrid of mandarin orange. The fruit looks somewhat like a small grapefruit with an uneven skin, and can be either yellow or green depending on the degree of ripeness.\n\ud83c\udf38A dual functional product: Whitening + Anti-wrinkle.\n\ud83c\udf38Contains 82% of Korean Yuja Extract for brightening and moisturising.\n\ud83c\udf38With 5% of Niacinamide to brighten up skin.\n\ud83c\udf38Prevents the forming of melanin with Glutathione and Arbutin.\n\ud83c\udf38Revitalises dull skin and ease off skin stress with 12 types of Vitamins.\n\ud83c\udf38It has a lightweight texture that let the skin absorb easily and leaves skin without sticky feeling.\nApply an appropriate amount on the face evenly and pat gently for further absorption.\nDespite the fact that niacinamide is currently quite popular, at first I was a little hesitant about this product since I didn\u2019t know what the name \u201cYuja\u201d meant. I thus stored this item in my cabinet and actually forgot it was there.\nAfter a while, I observed my friend\u2019s complexion had cleared up. She gave me this product recommendation when I inquired what she was using. When I got home, I used this one right away after taking it out of my cabinet. I was really struck by how gentle this stuff smelled. A lot of the reviews I read were favorable, which peaked my interest in the effects this product might have on my skin.\nThe serum did not leave a sticky feeling and was light enough to be quickly absorbed. I have just used the serum, but I believe the entire set will produce results that are pleasing. The imperfections from my acne are beginning to diminish, and my coworkers have also noticed that I am becoming fairer.\nThe results weren\u2019t immediately apparent, but with continued use, your skin will improve. As you can see in my photo (which I zoomed out so you would notice), on the before photo, you can clearly see my pores, but on the other photo, you can tell that my skin went smoother after using this product for two weeks. I still have oily skin, so I\u2019m not sure how that will resolve, but other than that, I\u2019m quite pleased with what I saw in the mirror.\nI heartily suggest it to anyone who suffer acne-related dark spots and blemishes. This item works wonders, in my opinion. Without a doubt, I\u2019ll purchase it once again.\nNext postHow To Boost Our Immune System?<|endoftext|>[US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice] met human rights activists and said she wanted to help them build institutions to protect people from the \u201carbitrary power of the state\u201d\u2026 wait for it\u2026 in Russia.\nTurns out the Republic of the Congo is not the same country as the Democratic Republic of the Congo\u2026 And some disturbing reports from the DRC :/.\nPeak oil is so last"

I\u2019m doing good.\nIt\u2019s been almost a year now since I had the thyroid surgery to remove cancer and everything seems to be OK on that front. They have scheduled me for another full body scan in a few months time to check if there is anything to worry about but they are not expecting to find anything as far as I know.\nI am refusing to take the high dose of thyroid medication they want me to take because the side effects make it too hard to function. The dose I am taking is keeping me at \u201cnormal\u201d levels but I don\u2019t feel normal.\nI\u2019m pretty much waiting to die physically because I have no energy to do anything else. It takes everything I have just to make a trip to the shopping center and bring the groceries up the stairs. I don\u2019t have enough energy to do anything much at all these days although I can still manage to go out for dinner if I get invited provided I don\u2019t have to do anything else the same day like go to work.\nI\u2019m only working three days a week now and, by the third day, I am so worn out it takes me two days to recover and things are only getting worse on the health front!\nMy blood pressure always used to be good but the day I was due for release from hospital after the radioactive iodine treatment they said my blood pressure was high. It has not come back down since then so they have put me on medication for that.\n The right eye is so bad it would be classified legally blind for driving purposes but the other eye is still good enough to allow me to continue driving for now. I am on the waiting list to have eye surgery which looks like it won\u2019t happen for about another year.\nI get the feeling one or two of the people I work with think I have been given a really tough road to walk. I have been called a \u201creal trooper\u201d and an \u201cAussie battler\u201d and the past year has been referred to as my \u201cannus horribillus\u201d and sometimes they look so sorry for me I fear they are about to burst into tears on my behalf but that isn\u2019t how it seems to me at all.\n Depression and anxiety were way harder to live with than cancer has been! My gambling addiction was much more distressing for me to cope with than going blind is!\nIf you want my honest opinion \u2013 I feel truly blessed and extremely lucky!\nI\u2019ve been making lousy health choices for a very long time now yet God has seen fit to let me escape with the one form of cancer that is the easiest to treat! I have cataracts but they are the kind that can be removed and they are not developing at the same rate in both eyes so I can still see well enough to read and use the computer.\nI always feel tired and run down but God has brought me to the perfect job in preparation for this stage of my life. I earn the same amount of money from three overnight shifts per week as I would make if I was working full time in a day job. If I was in any other job I most likely would have been forced to quit or I would have been sacked for not being able to keep up with my duties. The company is even looking at letting us work from home which will mean I could keep working even if I do lose my sight and can no longer drive!\nMy depression, anxiety, and gambling addictions have been overcome and I have two adult kids who love me very much and will help me out any time I need them.\nGod loves me and He is looking out for me and it doesn\u2019t matter how it looks to the rest of the world \u2013 I am blessed and I know it!\nI\u2019m content to keep living for as long as God lets me keep my independence. I will continue to pray that God will take me home to Him before I become a burden on anyone but I will go on knowing, without a shadow of a doubt, that whatever happens will be Gods will. If God wills it then I know for certain it\u2019s for the best.\nAll I really need is God\u2019s love and I have that.

Updates of the 2022 Premier League match on April 21st 2022. Kick-off start time is 7:45pm BST.\nBe sure to check VAVEL for post-match content and for coverage of the remainder of this season, it is going to be exciting at both ends of the table.\nMy name is Luke Williamson, I hope you have enjoyed tonight's commentary!\nFULL TIME. That's just about all from me tonight, thank you for joining me.\nA very entertaining game, plenty of chances and a great atmosphere too.\nBurnley deserved it in the end. Despite Romeu's first half headers, they had the better of the chances and should have been out of sigh at half-time.\nSaints didn't really show up, it was hardly their best performance of the season but, as I said yesterday, they are safe and can't feasibly get in to Europe so their season is all but done.\nConnor Roberts stood out for sure, but Dwight McNeil looked like his old self.\nHe hasn't had a great season, maybe the rumours of big money moves got in his head, but he looked to be enjoying himself out there tonight.\nThe big question is, who is in charge of Burnley at home to Wolves on Sunday? Mike Jackson and his interim team have done a good job at settling the ship.\nSouthampton travel to Brighton next.\nFULL TIME. Turf Moor erupts at full time as Burnley claim a much needed three points.\nAfter starting on the back foot, Connor Roberts gave Burnley the lead with a fine left-footed strike from outside the area.\nThe Clarets could have doubled and trebled their lead shortly after with Forster denying Weghorst before the Dutch striker then hit the post.\nThe hosts did get their second before half-time, Nathan Collins - who looks a class act and the future of that back-line - rose highest to head home from a corner.\nThe second half was tense, with Southampton more of the good opportunities - Che Adams seeing his powerful volley tipped over the bar by Nick Pope, before the England shotstopper pushed away a James Ward-Prowse free-kick.\nThe result takes Burnley to within a point of Everton and five of Leeds United, albeit playing a game more than The Toffees.\nSouthampton miss the opportunity to go into the top half, and stay 13th.\nFULL TIME. That is that and a massive win for Burnley!\n90+3. My man of the match tonight has got to be Dwight McNeil.\nFantastic to see him back at his best, whether it is the start of a run of form will be seen soon enough, but nonetheless a fantastic performance.\nSpecial mention to Connor Roberts, who is a close second.\n90+1. Into five added minutes now.\n89. The game is coming to a slow end now.\nBurnley fans applaud as \"There's only one Sean Dyche\" rings around the Turf.\n86. Handball appeals from The Clarets.\nTarkowski's volley hits the arm of Ward-Prowse, but VAR have a look and say nothing doing.\nMcNeil then curls an effort wide, his best game in a long time. He is then replaced by Matt Lowton.\n84. Six minutes to go and the ol\u00e9s come out from the Clarets faithful.\nLennon wins Burnley a corner.\n83. Final change for Southampton.\nTino Livramento is on for Walker-Peters.\n80. A lovely set piece move by Burnley.\nRoberts slides it down the line for Rodriguez, the striker fizzes it across the six yard box behind both Vydra and Collins.\n80. Perraud is the latest name into the book.\nHe brings McNeil down, after the winger got by him on the halfway line.\n76. Brownhill gets the delivery horribly, horribly wrong.\nBurnley are going to make a change here: Weghorst is off and Matej Vydra comes on in his place.\n75. 15 minutes or so left to play and the atmosphere is tense at Turf Moor.\nBurnley have been breached a couple of times recently but Pope has only had one save to make.\nFree kick for The Clarets in a crossing position for a foul by Perraud on Roberts.\n72. Taylor makes a definite goal-saving block from Adams.\nCollins goes down with a head injury and the Southampton players don't like that and a skirmish occurs.\nBednarek and Tarkowski receive yellow cards.\n71. Pope gets two strong hands on it, behind for another corner.\n70. Southampton get out of trouble and find themselves high up the pitch.\nRodriguez fouls Redmond and it is in definite James Ward-Prowse territory.\n69. Rodriguez flicks it on, but Tarkowski can not get on the end of it.\n69. At the other end, Lennon wins a corner with his first action since coming on.\n67. What a reaction save from Pope!\nThe cross is floated in for Adams, and the Scotland striker hits a volley straight at Pope who gets a strong palm to send it over the bar.\nBurnley deal with the set piece.\n65.

        "passage": " front-line units \u201cshould enter a wartime state to be fully battle ready to launch surprise operations,\u201d it added.\nThe Kim regime has frequently issued bellicose statements, claiming that the divided Korean Peninsula was \u201con the brink of war\u201d whenever the United States and South Korea conduct one of their joint annual war games, which it called rehearsals for invasion. But the latest threat followed a highly unusual exchange of artillery shells across the two Koreas\u2019 land border.\nSouth Korean military radar detected what appeared to be a North Korean rocket landing in Yeoncheon County, near the border north of Seoul, at 3:52 p.m. Thursday, the Defense Ministry said in a brief statement.\nTwenty minutes later, the North carried out another attack, said Col. Jeon Ha-gyu, a South Korean military spokesman. The South Korean news agency Yonhap quoted unnamed military sources as saying that the second attack involved several rounds from a 76.2-millimeter direct-fire weapon.\nSouth Korea responded by firing \u201cdozens\u201d of shells from a 155-millimeter artillery unit, targeting the rocket\u2019s launching point in the North, the ministry said.\n\u201cOur military raised its vigilance to the highest level and is closely watching the movement of the North Korean military, ready to respond strongly and decisively to any further provocations from the North,\u201d Colonel Jeon said.\nAbout 220 people from two villages in Yeoncheon were evacuated into underground shelters, said Hong Seong-beom, a county official. Mr. Hong said there were no immediate reports of damage.\nNorth Korea said the South fired 36 artillery shells across the border, some of them falling near its guard posts but not causing injuries, the headquarters of the North\u2019s military, known as the People\u2019s Army, said in a statement carried by the Korean Central News Agency.\nNorth Korea denied the first rocket attack but did not comment on what South Korea said was a second attack. \u201cThis reckless provocative mania should never go unpunished,\u201d the North said, reporting the emergency meeting of its Central Military Commission.\nThe North\u2019s attacks followed repeated threats to attack the loudspeakers that South Korea had turned on along the border last week to broadcast propaganda.\nPresident Park Geun-hye convened an emergency meeting of the South\u2019s National Security Council on Thursday and ordered the military to \u201cdeal resolutely with any North Korean provocations,\u201d said her spokesman, Min Kyung-wook.\nThe exchange of fire was the first serious armed clash between the countries since North Korea carried out an artillery attack on a South Korean border island in 2010, killing two marines and two civilians. At the time, South Korea retaliated by pounding gun positions in the North.\nIn recent years, the two sides have exchanged minor fire, mostly harmless warning shots, across their border. In May of last year, a North Korean patrol boat fired two rounds of artillery, which fell 490 feet from a South Korean Navy ship in waters near a disputed western sea border. The South\u2019s ship responded by firing several rounds of its own.\nTensions have been on the rise along the countries\u2019 heavily armed 155-mile border since Aug. 4, when two South Korean border guards were seriously wounded by land mines that the South said were planted by the North. North Korea has denied planting the mines.\nIn retaliation, South Korea last week began using loudspeakers along the border to broadcast propaganda messages into North Korea, a tactic dating from the Cold War that had not been used in 11 years. The North turned on propaganda loudspeakers of its own, and it threatened to attack South Korea\u2019s.\n\u201cThe fact that the North only launched one rocket without hitting any South Korean loudspeaker indicates that the North meant it as a warning,\u201d said Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Dongguk University in Seoul.\nMr. Koh said that the North was unlikely to escalate the exchange of fire into a major skirmish, given the large-scale joint military exercise \u2014 called Ulchi-Freedom Guardian \u2014 that the United States and South Korea kicked off this week.\nThe Koreas are technically at war, the 1950-53 Korean War having ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty.<|endoftext|>March 6, 2017 (Press Release) -- With more than 30 years of experience, Ron Ehlers, an enterprising and award-winning Top Information Technology Executive with a broad range of experience in leading highly productive IT and business teams, is now available for engagements.\nBringing extensive business and technology knowledge and experience to the table, Ron built teams that took two retail organizations from systems infancy to fully integrated technology infrastructures while those companies were achieving significant profitable business growth.

I was so happy up to Monday this week because he was falling asleep within 5-10 mins of putting him in the cot with a bit of singing and rocking and was sleeping 2 and sometimes even 3 hour naps. Now he just cries and cries really loud (not a whiney tired cry anymore) and takes up to 25 mins to settle for a crummy 30 minute nap. I shouldn't have been so cocky about my success last week!!!\nAny advice from those who have been here and come out the other side?\nI think this is shaping up to be a 5 month old thing! Mine has started being a bit difficult to get down over last couple days.\nWe went through something similar. Didn't cry for a long time but did cry a lot when being swaddled and rocked for her nap. Once asleep she was ok. It lasted about a week from memory and suddenly she stopped doing it.\nI could have written this myself. Same here.\nHere too! Varies day to day. Yesterday was a shocker!\nYep yesterday was appalling! He's been resisting naps all week since Monday but yesterday he was even resisting bedtime. So frustrating!! Thanks for your reply. I'm not happy that you're going through the same thing but I'm glad I'm not the only one!\nThanks for your reply, I'm really glad it's not just us!\nThanks for your comment. I'm sure it's just one of those things that just get better by themselves. Hoping it's only a week like your experience with it!\nIt must be. There seem to be a few of us going through it at the same time. I hope it gets better for us all sooner rather than later!! Thanks for your reply.<|endoftext|>1.

It is qualified as major because it is the larger of the two. The major seventh spans eleven semitones, its smaller counterpart being the minor seventh, spanning ten semitones. For example, the interval from C to B is a major seventh, as the note B lies eleven semitones above C, and there are seven staff positions from C to B. Diminished and augmented sevenths span the same number of staff positions, but consist of a different number of semitones (nine and twelve).\nThe easiest way to locate and identify the major seventh is from the octave rather than the unison, and it is suggested that one sings the octave first.[2] For example, the most commonly cited example of a melody featuring a major seventh is the tonic-octave-major seventh of the opening to \"(Somewhere) Over the Rainbow\".[2] \"Not many songwriters begin a melody with a major seventh interval; perhaps that's why there are few memorable examples.\"[3] However, two songs provide exceptions to this generalisation: Cole Porter's opens with a descending major seventh and Jesse Harris's,(made famous by Norah Jones in her 2002 debut album, Come Away with Me), starts with an ascending one. In the refrain of \"Bali Hai\" in \"South Pacific,\" the third tone (\"Hai\") is a major seventh to the first (\"Ba-\").\nAnother piece that makes more dramatic use of the major seventh is \"The Hut on Fowl's Legs\" from Mussorgsky's piano suite Pictures at an Exhibition (1874).\nAnother is the closing duet from Verdi's Aida, \"O terra addio.\"[9] During the early 20th century, the major seventh was used increasingly both as a melodic and a harmonic interval, particularly by composers of the Second Viennese School. Anton Webern's, opens with a major seventh and the interval recurs frequently throughout the piece.\nUnder equal temperament this interval is enharmonically equivalent to a diminished octave (which has a similar musical use to the augmented unison).\nThe major seventh chord is however very common in jazz, especially 'cool' jazz, and has a characteristically soft and sweet sound: think of the first chord in \"The Girl from Ipanema\".[citation needed] The major seventh chord consists of the first, third, fifth and seventh degrees (notes) of the major scale. In the key of C, it comprises the notes C E G and B.<|endoftext|>- Main Ingredient : Ginseng berry extracts 95%, Ginseng leaf extracts 0.5%, Mixed fruit concentrate 1.5% etc.\n- Amount of intake : Please eat a ginseng berry 1 pack daily before each meal.\n- Manufacturer : Korea Genetic Pharm Co., Ltd.\n- How to Store : Store this product at room temperature.\nWe are wholesale store in the South Korea.

Leaves are bud on the ginseng tree by March and come into bloom between April to May.\nLooking into the flower bottom, green berries begin to appear and you can see red berries by July.\nGinseng berries are known to contain 10~15 times saponin compared to ginseng roots or red ginseng.\nSaponins are at maximum level in ginseng berries during their initial several days when they bear berry and show solid green color for 3 to 4 days.\nHigh-quality ginseng berries can be obtained only if ginsengs are more than 3 years old and are cultivated during these 3 to 4 days until their pick level.\n*Do you know the saponin?\nSaponin, antioxidant found in ginseng, may also help in reducing levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.\nSapona means soap in Greek and originates from fine bubbles from soap in water solution. Since saponin generally reduces surface tension in water, it easily makes bubbles while showing hemolytic action.\nSaponin component is found various parts of the plant: roots, stems, leaves, skin and seeds. With strong heart stimulant or diuretic functions, it has been widely used as herbal medicine for a long time.\nReacting to cell as an active surface agent, some saponin is known to destroy the structure of cell membranes while increasing its penetrability. Among other plant saponin, ginseng saponin has mild property as a medicine, almost zero toxicity and hemolytic action. In particular, ginseng saponin shows quite a different chemical structure compared to other saponin components found in other plants.\nTo distinguish ginseng saponin from other plant saponin, it is called Ginsenoside, standing for ginseng glycoside.<|endoftext|>Description: Karate for ages 3 to adult.

The employed PWV results calculated from the radiosonde data were the data provided by the Department of Atmospheric Science at University of Wyoming through the internet (http://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/sounding. html).\nThe radiosonde measurement is carried out for two times per day (4 times depending on the weather condition) at 0000 UTC and 1200 UTC in the Sokcho meteo- rological observatory. The GPS observatory operated by KASI is located inside the meteorological observatory. In the Sokcho meteorological observatory, the 1524 Model of Jinyang Engineering had been used before 2000 and then the RS80-15L Model of Vaisala, Finland, was used. It was replaced by the DFM-06 Model of GRAW, Germany, from 0000 UTC, May 1, 2007. Since 0000 UTC, June 1, 2009, the RS92 Model of Vaisala has been employed until now.\n\nChoice of events and analytical method\nRadiosonde is floated usually at the elevating speed of 5-8 m/s by a balloon charged with hydrogen or helium gas. At such elevating speed, it takes about 40 minutes to reach 16 km of altitude and 1 hour and half to reach 30 km of altitude (World Meteorological Organization 2008). Thus, 30 minutes after the initiating the observation, a radiosonde is elevated to 12 km of altitude under which most of the atmospheric water vapor is contained (Mc-Millin et al. 2007).\nThe radiosonde error and bias are divided into random error and systematic bias that are quantitatively expressed as root mean square error (RMSE) and mean bias, respectively. Reference data is required to calculate the radiosonde random error and systematic bias by comparing the radiosonde PWV; the GPS PWV data calculated by KASI in 30-minute interval were used in this study.\nThe analysis was carried out in this study for the period from 0000 UTC, June 1, 2007 to 1200 UTC, May 31, 2009, when the DFM-06 Model was used, including the events when over 0.5 mm per hour of rainfall continued for more than 30 minutes in Sokcho. To analyze the difference between the daytime and nighttime rainfalls, the GPS PWV data calculated at 0000 and 1200 UTC, the radiosonde observation times, were respectively compared with the radiosonde PWV.\nTo choose the rainfall events, we employed the onehour precipitation accumulation data observed by the automatic weather system to which a 0.5 mm tippingbucket rain gauge is installed. Since a weak rainfall generally refers to the rainfall less than 0.2 mm of precipitation per hour (http://www.hrfco.go.kr/html/flood/ floodClass_5.jsp, accessed October 1, 2010), the events in which the rainfall over 0.5 mm of precipitation per hour continued for more than 30 minutes from the radiosonde observation time were chosen in this study. Table 1 shows the number of radiosonde observations at Sokcho Observatory used in the analysis, for daytime and nighttime and for each season. The total number of floating in the two years was 650 times in daytime (0000 UTC) and 677 in nighttime (1200 UTC) and the number did not include the cases when the radiosonde observation was failed or the necessary GPS PWV data was lacking. Table 2 shows the number of radiosonde observation events in each month when the rainfall over 0.5 mm of precipitation per hour continued for more than 30 minutes from the radiosonde observation time. It can be known from Tables 1 and 2 that the number of rainfall events is relatively small when compared with the number of non-rainfall events, which is because there was only two times per day when the GPS observation and radiosonde observation were carried out at the same time since the radiosonde observation was performed two times a day although the GPS PWV data were generated at every 30 minutes. In addition, choosing the events when the rainfall over 0.5 mm of precipitation per hour continued for more than 30 minutes, the cases when there was even one minute of non-rainfall moment in the 30 minutes duration were all excluded from the choice.\n\nCOMPARISON AND ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS\nThe GPS and radiosonde PWV pairs calculated in the events corresponding to Table 2 are denoted as WET and the pairs in other time period were denoted as DRY. Table 2. Summary of radiosonde monthly profiles in the event of 1-hour rainfall (>0.5 mm) maintained more than 30 minutes for two years.  Based on this, the difference of the GPS and radiosonde PWV between the daytime and the nighttime was analyzed depending on the rainfall events in the two years from June, 2007 to May, 2009. To investigate the difference of PWV depending on the time of radiosonde observation, the scatter diagram of the radiosonde and GPS PWV is shown in Fig. 3 for the daytime and nighttime. Here, the entire observation data mentioned in Table 1 were used. The Figure shows that the slopes of the regression lines of the daytime observation and nighttime observation are 0.965 and 1.044, respectively. As known by the previous studies, the dry bias was found in the daytime radiosonde observation. The nighttime observation showed the wet bias in the radiosonde observation and the correlation coefficient with the GPS PWV was higher in nighttime than in daytime.\n\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Total\nDry bias can take place by the sun because the radiosonde sensor is exposed to the outside as shown in Fig.  1. To investigate the difference of the daytime and nighttime radiosonde PWV depending on rainfall occurrence, the GPS PWV was compared with the radiosonde PWV and the analysis results are shown in Figs. 4-6. In each Figure, the top part shows the change of the (radiosonde PWV)/(GPS PWV) ratio in the daytime observation depending on the GPS PWV and the bottom part shows the change in the nighttime observation. The analysis excluded the data that were assumed to be outlier as the radiosonde PWV was less than half of the GPS PWV or 2 times more than the GPS PWV.\nExcept the nighttime rainfall events in Fig. 4, the trend was found that the radiosonde PWV was changed from overestimation to underestimation when compared to the GPS PWV as the GPS PWV increased, which was similar to the analytical result by Kim et al. (2009). In addition, the difference between the daytime and nighttime observations showed that the trend shifting from overestimation to underestimation was more distinctive in daytime than in nighttime regardless of rainfall occurrence. Such a tendency can be also verified by the comparison of the slopes of the regression lines in Table 3. For the next, we performed the analysis of the daytime and nighttime data depending on the rainfall occurrence. With respect to all the rainfall events in Figs. 4-6, the tendency that   the wet bias of the radiosonde PWV increased as the GPS PWV decreased and the dry bias of the radiosonde PWV increased as the GPS PWV increased was significantly less distinctive in nighttime than in daytime. This result may be because the variation of the radiosonde PWV relative to the GPS PWV was decreased as the humidity sensor heating was reduced by cloud and water drops due to the solar radiation. Cady-Pereira et al. (2008) also showed that the radiosonde dry bias can be affected by the elevating speed and the appearance of cirrus and aerosol.\nFor the quantitative analysis of the radiosonde PWV bias and error, we calculated the mean bias and RMSE with the GPS PWV and presented the results in Table 4. The systematic bias that represents the degree of the sensor bias can be calibrated. The random error represents the range of the values irregularly varying within the uncertainty and thus small random error means high sensor accuracy (Kim et al. 2009). It was found that the mean bias was decreased in the second year regardless of rainfall occurrence both in the daytime and nighttime, which was also found in the study performed in the similar period by Ha & Park (2008). Since the maker of the radiosonde sensor updated the software in the spring of 2008 (Lee 2010), a further accurate analysis may be required. However, the RMSE was decreased in the nighttime, while it was increased in the daytime. The increasing rate of the RMSE was particularly high in the daytime during the rainfall events.\nIn a previous study, Ohtani & Naito (2000) reported that the RMSE between the GPS PWV and the radiosonde PWV was 3.7 mm using the six months of the observation data from ten radiosonde observatories located in the Japanese Islands. Compared to this result, the RMSE of our study was similar to that of previous studies in non-rainfall cases, but it was somewhat larger in rainfall cases. A long-term comparative study with more data is required to produce more objective results.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nIn this study, we compared the PWV data derived from the radiosonde observation data at Sokcho Meteorological Observatory and the PWV data at Sokcho GPS Observatory provided by KASI, from 0000 UTC, June 1, 2007 to 1200 UTC, May 31, 2009, and analyzed the radiosonde bias between the daytime and the nighttime. Through this, we investigated the characteristics of the daytime and nighttime radiosonde water vapor observation data depending on rainfall occurrence.\nThe time series show"

Therefore, the focus has been put on creating job opportunities for the vulnerable in society, including young people, women, the elderly, the \u201cnew middle-aged\u201d and people with disabilities.\nA subsidy for additional youth employment has been greatly increased to 700 billion won. The number of beneficiaries will increase to 188,000, including 90,000 new beneficiaries this year. When a business hires a new young person, it is possible to receive up to nine million won annually for three years.\nThe number of people eligible for the youth reserve funds has more than doubled to 230,000 from 110,000. If one lands a job at an SME or a middle-market company, it is possible to collect a maximum 30 million won over three years.\nNew middle-aged workers who want to find new jobs or re-enter the workforce after quitting a job will be provided with tailored training. Jobs for the elderly will increase to 610,000, and the number of jobs taking care of young children, senior citizens and people with disabilities will be increased to 136,000.\nBy newly creating 2,500 jobs for those with disabilities, the number of available jobs will be expanded to 20,000. The supported employment programs that link on-site training for severely disabled people with their employment will benefit an additional 2,500 people, bringing the total number assisted to 5,000.\nSecond, the budget for innovative growth has been significantly increased. The Government will foster competitive SMEs and business ventures, which will be conducive to economic growth and job creation. The total R&D budget stands at 20.4 trillion won, exceeding 20 trillion won for the first time in history. Investments in basic research, far-sighted investments in future original technologies and investments in R&D closely linked to citizens\u2019 everyday lives have been increased by large margins.\nTo further promote innovative growth, a total budget of 5.1 trillion won will be injected into three strategic areas, namely data, artificial intelligence and the hydrogen economy as well as eight pace-setting industries, including smart factories, self-driving cars, drones and fintech.\nInnovative startups are the basic foundation for innovative growth. As of August, a total of 70,000 new corporations were created this year, and a new venture investment of 2.2 trillion won was made.\nIn the face of difficult economic conditions, record highs have been accomplished in all regards. In particular, new venture investments have increased significantly. These are promising indicators not just for innovative growth but for the nation's economy as a whole.\nMy Administration will help an increasing number of young people harbor a dream to start a new business. They will be able to receive a maximum of 100 million won in the form of vouchers for their production of prototypes and marketing activities.\nCustomized support for different stages such as the foundation of a business, growth and relaunching a business will be strengthened. Funds for the facilitation of job creation will be newly established, and support through a startup success package will be expanded, thereby providing assistance to revitalize the ecosystem for starting a business.\nFor the sake of innovative growth, my Administration will accelerate deregulation. So far, deregulations have been carried out in the sectors of medical equipment, internet banks and the data economy. The Korean-type regulatory sandbox system will support the swift release of new business technologies and products.\nThird, the budget aimed at increasing household income and strengthening the social safety net has been greatly increased.\nThe Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), an incentive for working low-income families, contributes to income-driven growth and is a key policy for building an inclusive state.\nThe budget for the EITC has been greatly increased to 3.8 trillion won from this year's 1.2 trillion won. The age limit has been eliminated, and criteria concerning the income and assets have been eased, so the number of eligible households has greatly increased to 3.34 million from 1.66 million. Among them, 1.15 million self-employed will come to enjoy these benefits. The maximum financial support will be raised to 1.5 million won from 850,000 won for single-person households, to 2.6 million won from 2 million won for single-earner households and to 3 million won from 2.5 million won for double-income households.\nThe budget for guaranteeing basic living related to livelihood, healthcare, housing and education has been increased to 12.7 trillion won from this year's 11 trillion won.\nThe monthly basic pension and the pension for those with disabilities will be increased earlier than scheduled so that a total of 1.5 million senior citizens in the lowest 20 percent income bracket and 160,000 people with disabilities who receive the allowance for living and healthcare will receive 300,000 won a month starting in April next year.\nUp to now, several areas have not been given the Government\u2019s appropriate attention.\nThe childrearing allowance for single-parent families has been increased to 200,000 won from 130,000 won. The limit on the age of the children targeted has been raised from 14 to 18, thereby increasing the number of beneficiaries. Notably, the child-rearing allowance given to a household headed by a single young adult who is younger than 24 has been increased to 350,000 won from 180,000 won.\nOne out of four youths discharged from orphanages after their eligible care ends winds up in poverty. In addition to support from local governments, 300,000 won will be provided every month to help them stand on their own feet as a way of fulfilling the responsibility of the state.\nA comprehensive plan customized for the different stages of life for people with developmental disabilities has been established this year. Related expenditures have also been allocated.\nMicrobusiness and other self-employed business owners are important members of our economy. To help them overcome hardships caused by an increase in the minimum wage, a 2.8 trillion won job stabilization fund has been reflected again in next year\u2019s budget.\nTo reduce the burden from credit card processing fees, a simple payment system for microbusiness owners will be set up to cover one million businesses initially next year. A total of 2 trillion won will be offered in low-interest special loans, and credit guarantees will be expanded to 2 trillion won. The number of self-employed individuals owning a one-person microbusiness entitled to employment insurance subsidies will be drastically increased, and the duration of subsidies provided will be extended to three years from two years.\nFourth, budget expenditures designed to improve the people\u2019s safety and quality of life have been meticulously prepared.\nA total of 2.2 trillion won has been allocated for three major projects to protect the lives of the people: suicide prevention, industrial accident prevention and traffic safety reinforcement. Infrastructure related to everyday life will improve the living conditions and quality of life. A total of 160 neighborhood gymnasiums will be created, and at least one small library will be opened in every district, city and county. The facilities of 450 traditional markets will be modernized, and parking lots will be expanded. As part of the Fishing Community New Deal 300 project, modernization assistance will be provided next year to the first batch of 70 fishing communities and ports. Urban regeneration as well as assistance for improving basic living conditions in farming and fishing communities will help revitalize old city centers and farming areas.\nTo this end, 8.7 trillion won, a 50-percent increase from this year\u2019s budget, will be provided next year to build infrastructure pertaining to everyday life.\nThe number of children eligible for state-funded in-home care services will be doubled, and the number of service hours will be raised to 720 hours from the current 600 hours a year.\nThere is still a severe shortage of national and public daycare centers and kindergartens. An additional 450 national and public daycare centers will be opened next year. The date for adding 1,000 classes to national and public kindergartens will be moved up to next year. In addition, a child\u2019s right to learn will be guaranteed, and working conditions for teachers will be improved to ensure the provision of a better education. Extended after-school daycare programs for elementary school pupils will be drastically expanded.\nTogether with inclusiveness, another important pillar supporting a sustainable Republic of Korea is peace on the Korean Peninsula.\nIn the past year, three inter-Korean summits and the historic North Korea-U.S. summit have taken place.\nThrough the agreement reached in the military domain, South and North Korea have completely eliminated the risk of inter-Korean military clashes on the Peninsula.\nResidents on the five northwestern border islands in the West Sea will be able to safely sail further out to catch blue crabs. The border area that includes Paju, Yeoncheon, Cheorwon and Goseong will be transformed from a danger zone into an area for exchanges and cooperation.\nNow, South and North Korea and the United States will achieve complete denuclearization and permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula based on steadfast trust.\nThe second North Korea-U.S. summit is right ahead of us. Chairman Kim Jong Un\u2019s visit to Russia and Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s visit to North Korea are expected to take place soon. There is also the possibility of a North Korea-Japan summit. Chairman Kim Jong Un\u2019s reciprocal visit to Seoul will also likely happen in the near future.\nRight ahead of us lies a historic starting line"

And there\u2019s more to come: the museum will expand further in 2020, with an additional 13,000 square feet dedicated to new permanent collection galleries.\nAfter almost a year of construction in the historic Pioneer Endicott buildings, the Minnesota Museum of American Art (the M) recently opened a brand new facility to the public on Sunday, December 2, 2018. This new, permanent home is a project that has been years in the making. Since 2013, the M has organized touring shows and presented nationally recognized exhibitions and programs in its Project Space gallery, also housed in the Pioneer-Endicott complex originally designed in large part by famed architect Cass Gilbert. Behind the scenes, civic leaders, community supporters, trustees, and M staff have also been fundraising, planning, and mobilizing city and state support to realize the dream of building a permanent home for the M in this historic location.\nLike its smaller Project Space gallery, the new M is located in the Historic Pioneer Endicott, but its front entrance has moved. Note: the museum now has a new street address: 350 Robert Street North, St. Paul, 55101. Admission to the new M will remain free.\n100 Years and Counting: Selections from the Minnesota Museum of American Art features dozens of works from the M\u2019s collection of American art, from 100 years ago to today. It invites viewers into the breadth and depth of this remarkable collection: sculpture, paintings, drawings, photography, mid-century studio craft, early 20th century paintings, works by Paul Manship and George Morrison, as well as recent acquisitions by outstanding artists like Wendy Red Star, Alec Soth, and Teo Nguyen.\nThe M also commissioned New York-based artist Sheila Pepe to create a site-responsive installation for the new Henrietta Schmoll Rauenhorst Court. Sheila Pepe: Softly\u2026Before the Supreme Court refers to architect Cass Gilbert, who designed the Endicott building housing the new museum, as well as the Minnesota State Capitol and the U.S. Supreme Court building in Washington D.C. Her crocheted shapes offer a soft, gestural rejoinder to two landmark buildings by one of America\u2019s most famous architects.\nThe M will animate the streetscape with its new Window Gallery facing Robert Street. For the first installation in the Window Gallery, David Bowen: wave line, Duluth-based multimedia artist David Bowen is capturing real-time wave videos from locations all over the world, and then channeling the data into large screens lit by thousands of LEDs. Passersby can see the virtual undulation of water washing up on shorelines all over the globe \u2013 a view on distant shores, as seen through the M\u2019s windows in St. Paul.\nThe museum\u2019s Josephine Adele Ford Center for Creativity\u2014named for the St. Paul woman who ran 3 to 7 Playways, a company that created play and teaching materials for preschoolers\u2014also opens with the M in December. The M began as a school of art, and the museum is reviving that legacy with 4,000 square feet devoted to arts education. The new M will offer a variety of studio classes geared for adult learners including: drawing, oil painting, Hmong embroidery, rope-stitch jewelry, weaving, ceramic Mesoamerican flute-making, and more. Instructors include local artists at the top of their game: Xilam Balam, Leslie Barlow, Suzanne Thao, Maggie Thompson, Megan Vossler, and others. The M will also offer summer youth workshops in 2019.\nIn addition to studio art and craft classes for adults and youth, the Center for Creativity will be home to community convenings, drop-in art-making, family activities, and rotating Artist Takeovers. The M\u2019s new Artist Takeover residency program empowers artists of all disciplines to shape the M\u2019s learning spaces as makers, teachers, and creative catalysts. The M\u2019s first Artist Takeover is being led by Rebekah Crisanta de Ybarra, a local artist and co-founder of Electric Machete Studios. She\u2019ll be involved in both class instruction and her own art-making on-site, working in Latinx and Indigenous art forms. For the M\u2019s March Artist Takeover, poet and multimedia artist Moheb Soliman will take up residence in the Center for Creativity.\nThe Minnesota Museum of American Art is one of the oldest visual arts organizations in Minnesota, with roots stretching back to the 19th century. Based in St. Paul, the M currently holds more than 5,000 artworks that showcase the unique voices of American artists, guided by the belief that art should reflect the constantly shifting landscape that defines the American experience. The new M opened in December 2018 with16,000 square feet of exhibition, learning, and gathering spaces. In 2020, the museum will expand further with the opening of its permanent collection galleries. Upon completion of this second phase of construction, the new M will cover 36,000 square feet of space on the first floor of the Pioneer Endicott.\nFor details about the new M\u2019s upcoming events, exhibitions, and classes, look for updates on mmaa.org, or follow @mnmuseum on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\nGeorge Morrison (1919-2000) Cube, 1988 Wood 11 \u00be x 11 \u00be x 11 \u00be inches Sylvia Brown, Dr.<|endoftext|>package com.example.android.bonghwa.GroupInfo;\n\n/**\n * Created by sheep on 2016-11-26.\n */\n\npublic class GroupFile {\n    public String path;\n    public boolean isDirectory;\n    public long time;\n\n    public GroupFile(){\n    }\n\n    public GroupFile(String path, boolean isDirectory, long time){\n        this.path = path;\n        this.isDirectory = isDirectory;\n        this.time = time;\n    }\n}<|endoftext|>Secret Moonshine Be My Romeo is an import of Finland from lines which are uncommon in America.

Surprisingly, cholesterol was not significantly different in the eggs obtained from the different age groups. In contrast, the fat quality indices, including the lowest atherogenic index (AI) and thrombogenic index (TI) values and high hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic (h/H) fatty acid ratio, indicated the health-beneficial potential associated with fat intake from the eggs of intermediate and late-age laying hens. Overall, the results of the present investigation suggest that eggs from early-age laying hens can be recommended for a higher intake of antioxidant carotenoids and tocopherols, while the eggs from intermediate and late-age hens can be recommended for the intake of good quality fats.\n\nThe intense golden yellow pigmentation of the yolk, low levels of cholesterol, and higher n-3 PUFA content determine the commercial value (consumer acceptance) of eggs [7][8][9].\n\nAnimals, Diets, Sampling, and Sample Preparation\nFor the experimental purpose, a total of 90 Lohmann Lite Brown laying hens of early (24 weeks, n = 30), intermediate (42 weeks, n = 30), and late age (74 weeks, n = 30) were maintained at a commercial farm located in Yeoncheon-gun, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea. Laying hens of these age groups are used for the commercial production of eggs. The experimental protocol was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at Konkuk University (KU20169). The main ingredients and the nutrient composition of the experimental diets are shown in Table 1. All eggs were laid in the same period from different laying hens in August 2020. The egg samples (n = 30) obtained from each age group were brought to the laboratory, divided into six subgroups (five eggs in each subgroup), the egg yolk was separated from the respective egg white, homogenized using a food blender, and stored at \u221220 \u2022 C until analysis. The eggs obtained from early, intermediate, and late-age laying hens weighed an average of 53.9 \u00b1 0.49, 56.7 \u00b1 0.60, and 56.9 \u00b1 0.66 g, respectively. Similarly, 20.1 \u00b1 0.55, 24.1 \u00b1 1.14, and 25.1 \u00b1 0.78% egg yolk (% in weight) was recorded in the eggs obtained from early, intermediate, and late-age laying hens, respectively.\nA fraction of (15 g) the egg yolk samples from the homogenized samples was used for the extraction of major lipophilic compounds. For each group, the analytical parameters were determined in six independent experiments (one determination from each subgroup of five eggs).\n\nExtraction of Major Lipophilic Compounds\nThe major lipophilic compounds, including fatty acids, tocols, and sterols, were simultaneously extracted following the previous method [16][17][18][19] with minor modification. The detailed procedure is illustrated in Figure 1. The extracted crude lipids were aliquoted into three fractions, as illustrated in Figure 1, and utilized accordingly. Tocols and carotenoids were analyzed before hydrolysis as hydrolysis may cause significant degradation of carotenoids and tocopherol [16,20]. Moreover, in the preliminary studies, no esterified carotenoids were detected in the egg yolk and, thus, hydrolysis was avoided. However, for the analysis of sterols, crude lipids were hydrolyzed before GC-MS analysis [16].\n\nHPLC-DAD Analysis of Carotenoids and Tocols\nTocols and carotenoids were analyzed using an Agilent HPLC system (Model 1100; Agilent Technologies Canada, Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada) equipped with a DAD, autosampler, dual pump, and a YMC C30 column (250 \u00d7 4.6 mm 2, 5 \u00b5m; YMC, Wilmington, NC, USA). The solvent system was composed of methanol/water (95:5; mobile phase A) and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE)/methanol/water (90:7:3; mobile phase B). A gradient elution program was followed (0-100% B) for a total of 45 min of analysis time with a 5-min post-run at 0% B, at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Samples were scanned (180-800 nm) with a 0.05 min (1 s) response time at detection wavelengths of 295 nm (for tocols) and 450 nm (for carotenoids). The bandwidth and reference wavelengths were used as previously optimized [21].\n\nHPLC-DAD Analysis of Carotenoids and Tocols\nTocols and carotenoids were analyzed using an Agilent HPLC system (Model 1100; Agilent Technologies Canada, Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada) equipped with a DAD, autosampler, dual pump, and a YMC C30 column (250 \u00d7 4.6 mm 2, 5 \u00b5m; YMC, Wilmington, NC, USA).

The injector and detectors were precisely maintained at 250 and 260 \u00b0C, respectively. The inlet flow was 2 mL/min with a constant pressure of 54 psi. The FID parameters of airflow, hydrogen (H2) fuel flow, and make up flow (nitrogen, N2) were set to 400, 30, and 25 mL/min, respectively.

The column was equilibrated by a 5-min post-run at 140 \u2022 C. The FAMEs were identified by comparing them to the retention times of authentic standards. Additionally, for more precise qualitative analysis, the mass spectra were recorded using a GC-MS system (QP2010 SE; Shimadzu, Japan), following the optimized thermal GC-FID analysis program. The identity of the FAMEs was confirmed by comparing their fragmentation pattern with authentic standards.\nSterols were analyzed after silylation as illustrated in Figure 2A, utilizing QP2010 SE GC-MS equipped with an autoinjector and a fused silica Rxi-5ms column (30 m, 0.5 \u00b5m film thickness, 0.25 mm ID; Restek Corporation, Bellefonte, PA, USA).

The region needs around $700 billion in energy investment through 2035, according to International Energy Agency estimates -- a demand that's made Asia the world leader in adding renewable energy capacity.\nThese are the most impressive renewable energy projects in Asia.\nAn offshore wind turbine 100 meters in height and bladespan of 40 meters, stands positioned in the sea off the coast of the town of Naraha in Fukushima prefecture in Japan.\nJapan's Fukushima province was hard hit by the earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear disaster in 2011. The region now is home to an offshore wind farm demonstration project that aims to install three floating wind turbines, with an estimated around 18.8 billion yen investment, funded by the country's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI).\nWhen the project is completed, it's likely to become the world's largest floating offshore wind farm.\nAn Indonesian worker of PT. Pertamina Geothermal Energy checks one of its production wells in Kamojang in Indonesia.\nFaced with chronic power shortages, Indonesia is pursuing geothermal projects. Those projects often struggle to find financing as they require a lot of upfront capital spending and investors consider them risky. But the country has the largest geothermal resources in the world.\nIndonesia is beginning work on the Sarulla geothermal project on Sumatra island, likely the largest of its kind, after managing to secure around $1.2 billion in financing from multiple sources, with construction starting around 25 years after planning began. The project is expected to have around 330 megawatts (MW) of capacity.\nSolar panels at the Geogeum Solar Park Co. solar plant in this aerial photograph taken above Geogeum Island in Goheung, South Korea.\nAfter spending 30 years as a quarry, Geogeum Island in South Korea has been repurposed as a 25MW solar energy park spread over 660,000 square meters. The area is South Korea's sunniest.\nThe country has a history of seeking innovative places for its solar panels, including using them to as \"shade\" over bike paths.\nWorkers walk past rows of solar panels at the 2.3-megawatt floating solar power station operated by Kyocera TCL Solar LLC on Sakasamaike Pond in Kasai, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan.\nSolar goes swimming?\nThe world's largest floating solar farm is at Sakasamaike Pond in Japan's Kasai, Hyogo Prefecture. The 2.3MW plant has around 9,000 panels spread over floats and can produce enough electricity for around 820 households.\nOne of the advantages of floating solar plants is that the water helps to keep the panels from heating up, improving the efficiency. Japan has shown particular interest in the format due to its large number of reservoirs to supply water for growing rice; the panels can also help to prevent outbreaks of blue-green algae by blocking the light from reaching the water surface.\nSolar panels stand at the Welspun Energy solar power plant in Neemuch, Madhya Pradesh, India.\nThe Welspun Energy solar farm in India's Madhya Pradesh state is one of the world's largest, generating 151MW. That's expected to supply around 720,000 households with electricity, the company said.\nIndia, the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gasses, has been targeting an increase in renewable energy production, with a goal of boosting its solar energy capacity to 100GW by 2022.\nTwo workers clean up trash along the bank of the Yangtze River near the Three Gorges Dam in Yichang, in central China's Hubei province.\nChina's Three Gorges Dam hydropower project has been controversial pretty much from the get-go.\nAt least 1.4 million people were relocated, both in the construction phase and later, after rising water levels caused unforeseen landslides. Critics say the massive structure and the weight of the water in its 600-kilometer-long reservoir have caused thousands of \"slight\" earthquakes. It's also wrought havoc on the ecosystem along the Yangtze River and resulted in the flooding of many archeological sites. The reservoir also has collected tons of garbage and contamination after flooding toxic sites.\nEstimates of the cost vary widely, but in 2009, the official Xinhua news agency reported the price tag at around $37 billion, including the cost of relocating displaced people. But the project has met its goal of producing renewable energy, producing more than 200 billion KWH in 2014, estimated at more than twice the electricity demand of Beijing.<|endoftext|>Turlock High School offers college courses during zero period and after school, only one course per semester.

Error and timing is compared together to ensure\nthe methods are solving to the same accuracy when compared.\n\nMore wrappers will continue to be added as necessary.\n\n## Setup\n\n````julia\nusing ParameterizedFunctions, MATLABDiffEq, OrdinaryDiffEq, ODEInterface,\n      ODEInterfaceDiffEq, Plots, Sundials, SciPyDiffEq, deSolveDiffEq\nusing DiffEqDevTools\nusing LinearAlgebra\n````\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Non-Stiff Problem 1: Lotka-Volterra\n\n````julia\nf = @ode_def_bare LotkaVolterra begin\n  dx = a*x - b*x*y\n  dy = -c*y + d*x*y\nend a b c d\np = [1.5,1,3,1]\ntspan = (0.0,10.0)\nu0 = [1.0,1.0]\nprob = ODEProblem(f,u0,tspan,p)\nsol = solve(prob,Vern7(),abstol=1/10^14,reltol=1/10^14)\ntest_sol = TestSolution(sol)\n\nsetups = [Dict(:alg=>DP5())\n          Dict(:alg=>dopri5())\n          Dict(:alg=>Tsit5())\n          Dict(:alg=>Vern7())\n          Dict(:alg=>MATLABDiffEq.ode45())\n          Dict(:alg=>MATLABDiffEq.ode113())\n          Dict(:alg=>SciPyDiffEq.RK45())\n          Dict(:alg=>SciPyDiffEq.LSODA())\n          Dict(:alg=>SciPyDiffEq.odeint())\n          Dict(:alg=>deSolveDiffEq.lsoda())\n          Dict(:alg=>deSolveDiffEq.ode45())\n          Dict(:alg=>CVODE_Adams())\n  ]\n\nnames = [\n  \"Julia: DP5\"\n  \"Hairer: dopri5\"\n  \"Julia: Tsit5\"\n  \"Julia: Vern7\"\n  \"MATLAB: ode45\"\n  \"MATLAB: ode113\"\n  \"SciPy: RK45\"\n  \"SciPy: LSODA\"\n  \"SciPy: odeint\"\n  \"deSolve: lsoda\"\n  \"deSolve: ode45\"\n  \"Sundials: Adams\"\n  ]\n\nabstols = 1.0./ 10.0.^ (6:13)"
