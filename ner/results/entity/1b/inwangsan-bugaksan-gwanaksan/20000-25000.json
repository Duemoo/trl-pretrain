How quickly there is a return to normal or \u2013 an expression I really cannot abide, but which is used a great deal \u2013 a \u2018new normal\u2019 is very hard to predict. Newspapers, magazine and social media are full of columnists and opinion writers sharing their predictions of what the future holds. Much of it is unreliable, some outright nonsense. The Roman poet Horace had a very different perspective; \u201cCarpe diem, quam minimum credula postero,\u201d he wrote (\u201cSeize the day, put no trust in the future\u201d). In other words, try not to waste time worrying about the future (though it is easier said than done, even in Latin!) and concentrate on what needs to be done today.\nI have spent the last five months speaking and listening extensively to Northampton businesses, business groups, charities and community groups about the challenges that they face.\nI want to especially mention and thank the critical work of the Reverend Haydon Spenceley and his staff and volunteers of the Weston Favell Food Bank who have been working extraordinarily hard under the most difficult of circumstances to make sure that those people and families in crisis have the food and support they need. They are living proof of the meaning of the word community.\nSome organisations will weather the oncoming storm relatively well, others not so well. The ones who have been evolving and adapting are the ones best placed to pull through this.\nNorthamptonshire Police has been using the lockdown time wisely. It has been quietly rebuilding and strengthening its systems and operations. Its major crime squad has seriously disrupted major drugs gangs in the county by hitting them when they were weak. Six major drug cartel members are currently sharing 124 years of prison time because of determined work by the police. Their intelligence backlog has been cleared and they are on the front foot in terms of their Force performance indicators. For example, they now sit in the top performing quartile of Criminal Justice Outcomes. They now have more police officers than in 2010 and by 2023 they will have 526 more officers to add to that.\nLocal public services like health and local government are also cooperating like never before. Their relationships are closer, deeper and better as a result of this crisis and this bodes well for the deep integration work taking place between the local NHS and Adult Social Care.\nOur retail businesses have been adapting and upping their game by investing in online selling facilities to mitigate their physical retail sales loss and getting to grips with the power of social media to advertise. Northampton Forward is the town\u2019s umbrella organisation seeking to create a bright future for a re-imagined Northampton and has bids into Government to help achieve that; attending their meetings and providing a Parliamentary perspective has helped me support those efforts. Also, in what proved to be a timely event, Google came to Northampton pre-lockdown to provide top tips for our smaller retail businesses to augment their sales with digital techniques that are now ever more critical; again, I was pleased to attend and meet many of those taking part.\nI was very worried about the Royal and Derngate Theatre. The theatre has been in existence since 1884 and has been facing the perfect storm of vulnerability. The Arts Council, a key contributor for the Royal and Derngate, had been burning through their reserves to support theatres up and down the country and was on the point of financial exhaustion when the Government announced their \u00a31.6 billion fiscal rescue plan, just in the nick of time.\nThe Royal and Derngate was not the only cultural and heritage organisation facing financial oblivion. Delapre Abbey and the 78 Derngate museum were also on the cliff edge of existence. Thankfully, they now all have a fighting chance with the cultural and heritage rescue package.\nThe heritage package was just part of the \u00a330 billion array of support packages announced by the Chancellor. In these extraordinary times the Government has been deploying extraordinary support for the country. In normal times it would go against the economic and political instincts of many, including myself, and even in a time of zero and even negative world financial market interest rates the principal sum will have to be repaid at some stage and those rates will not be this low forever.

The \"A\" (actually an antenna icon) has two functions, one as a handset pager (for finding lost handsets by causing them to ring), and the second, desired function in your case to initiate registration. If you just tap the antenna logo it will start to slowly flash - indicating the page function has been activated. In order to start the activation function you must hold down the icon until it starts to rapidly flash while you are holding it down, which takes about three seconds.<|endoftext|>Popcorn ceilings in Rimforest homes and businesses were once very popular.

In consideration of its location, the museum was planned as an urban museum that exhibits contemporary artworks of various genres.\nMMCA Seoul preserves the architectural traces and memories of significant historical times ranging from the Joseon era (1392\u20131910) to the Japanese colonial era (1910\u20131945) and the Korean War (1950\u20131953) period. Architect Hyoun-jun Min tried to embrace these traces and memories to create a building that melds with the surrounding environment.\nAs such, the museum consists of three buildings of different periods\u2014a government office building from the Joseon Dynasty, a modern building built in the early 20th century, and a newly built contemporary style building. In particular, visitors can witness the remnants of different periods while sitting at the center of the museum\u2019s vast garden. They can also enjoy the beautiful landscape created by Gyeongbokgung Palace and Inwangsan Mountain on the west.\nThis museum sits on the foothills of Cheonggyesan Mountain encircled by nature. It offers visitors both art and relaxation amid nature through various programs and facilities (i.e. eight exhibition halls including the circular gallery, outdoor sculpture park, and Children\u2019s Museum).\nIt is situated in the west wing of Deoksugung Palace\u2019s Seokjojeon Hall, the first Western-style stone building in Korea. The beautiful garden next to the museum creates perfect harmony with the nearby buildings, and it adds to the elegant atmosphere of the museum. Another merit of the museum is that it exhibits renowned modern artwork from across the world.\nHoused in a former tobacco factory, MMCA Cheongju was designed to maintain the previous factory structure as much as possible to preserve its historical value. The museum exhibits approximately 11,000 pieces of artwork. In particular, unlike conventional storage, the \u201cVisible Storage\u201d allows visitors to enter and enjoy works of art that the museum stores behind glass windows.\nNot far from MMCA Seoul, Insa-dong is a popular tourist site among foreigners who want to experience traditional Korean culture. The streets are filled with antique shops, traditional handicraft stores, traditional tea houses, restaurants and galleries.\nShuttle bus operated between Gwancheon, Seoul and Deoksugung branches. Check website for schedule.\nMimesis Art Museum was designed by Alvaro Siza, who is called the \u201clast living master of modernist architecture.\u201d The owner of the museum had visited buildings designed by Siza in Portugal and the UK before asking him to design this museum. The design of Mimesis began from a sketch of a cat curled up and falling asleep under the warm afternoon sun. Indeed, the actual shape of the museum resembles a white cat lying on the quiet fields in Paju.\nExcept for the floors, both the museum\u2019s interior and exterior are white. Siza, known for his thoughtful consideration of the users/residents rather than pursuing external splendor, hid functional hardware such as switches and power outlets, and whitewashed the walls and ceilings to create an exhibition space ideal for displaying and viewing artwork. Siza contained variedly sized exhibition spaces into a single mass. Each small space is smoothly connected along curved walls. Plus, the gentle natural light coming through the skylight shines on"

Non Freemasons do not get to see a lodge meeting because everyone in the room must prove themselves to be a Freemason during the opening ceremony, however this page will give an insight to the rough layout of a normal meeting in the South Australian and Northern Territory Constitution (every constitution will do things a little differently).\nA lodge room is laid out East to West and North to South, with seating along the walls of all sides. In the middle of the room is a rectangular black and white tessellated pavement along with a few other objects central to the moral teachings of Freemasonry.\nThe Master of the Lodge sits on the East side where he presides over the entire meeting; next to him is the Immediate Past Master who, having been the previous Master, provides advice and support. Opposite the Master on the West side sits the Senior Warden, second in charge of the Lodge, while the Junior Warden sits along the South of the Lodge room. Each officer has moral reasons for sitting where he does, for example the Master is placed in the East to represent the sun, which rises in the East.\nTo demonstrate what a lodge room looks like during a meeting, see the interactive image below. It was taken at the April 2011 Grand Communication and so depicts a meeting of the Grand Lodge of South Australia and Northern Territory when the Grand Lodge officers for the year are installed in their respective positions. The bulk of the Freemasons in the photo are therefore Grand Lodge officers or representitives of lodges.\nDrag your mouse to move the image around.\n(As this was a meeting of Grand Lodge, the officers in the positions are Grand Officers hence their titles would actually contain the word Grand, eg Grand Master, Senior Grand Warden etc.).\nIf you can not see the images above, please install Adobe Flash.<|endoftext|>The newspapers of the City Condal center in the party of Anoeta more than in the security of the Classic one.

The photographed spaces are presented with no identification as to the specific locations they were taken or any chronology. The combination of text and drawing infuse the photographs with emotional and psychological allusions.\nReferencing both the filmic frame and a story- board and blending narrative and documentary, the notes explore narrative moments and attempt to construct the landscape of a personal geography. The hand-tinted process brings to mind the childlike activity of colouring books, as an attempt to make sense of space, colour, architecture and perspective, but can ultimately be read as the artist\u2019s attempt to question representation and to situate the photographed spaces in one\u2019s personal imagery.<|endoftext|>No gymnast gets to the Olympics without making major sacrifices along the way. For teens, that can mean skipping out on the traditional academic experience in favor of long days plowing through floor routines and mastering maneuvers on beam. Where does Laurie Hernandez go to school? The gold medalist is homeschooled, according to The Ringer.\nHernandez hasn't attended a brick-and-mortar school since she was about 10 years old, The Ringer reported. Instead, she spends most days at one of two gyms to chip away at her 35 hours of weekly training time. It's a grueling schedule, but Hernandez's hard work earned the 16-year-old an early acceptance to college: she made a verbal commitment to the University of Florida. After making Team USA, though, she decided to give up the gymnastics scholarship. Hernandez announced she's going pro on Instagram on Thursday: \"I am so proud and excited to announce that I've turned professional and given up my NCAA eligibility; although I will always be a Florida Gator at heart\ud83d\udc99 I'm looking forward to continuing to represent USA at the highest level of gymnastics for several years to come!\"\nThough Hernandez likely won't be going to college anytime soon, she may opt to finish high school. A Beka Academy provides Hernandez's homeschooling curriculum, according to Team USA. The school focuses on providing Christian education, with offerings of independent study options for high school students outlined on the academy's website. A Beka Academy coursework looks a lot like what most high schools offer, but the curriculum requires four credits in Bible studies. Though Hernandez often talks about faith being a big part of her life, Hernandez's USA Gymnastics profile indicates that her favorite school subjects are science and art.\nThough most students plan their lives around school, Hernandez plans school around her training schedule. Hernandez's typical training day starts at 8:30 a.m., NBC reported. She spends six days of each week at the gym, though she generally gets two half days. When she's finished flipping and flying, she heads home to get through her classwork. If she's training at Monmouth Gymnastics Academy, it only takes her about 15 minutes to get home to Old Bridge, New Jersey, according to The Ringer. Her other practice space, Gymland, is about an hour away. And after earning her place in the USA Gymnastics elite program, she's had to pencil in about 12 journeys per year to the famed Karolyi Ranch in Texas.\nThough her schedule doesn't allow her much free time, Hernandez still has hobbies outside of gymnastics; her USA Gymnastics profile reveals that she likes to go swimming, ride her bike, and even paint nails. Though she's known for her artistry in competition, she's also an artist off the floor: Hernandez is a writer who loves to draw.\nShe may not get the full high school experience, but she finally got to go to the Olympics as a member of The Final Five. Earning a silver medal on balance beam and getting the gold with her team, Hernandez got to see her dreams come true.<|endoftext|>Oh thank God.

You may have already seen one of Seoul\u2019s other major gates \u2013 the great east gate best known as Dongdaemun. If so, you\u2019ll notice that the north gate is a lot smaller. In fact, Sukjeongmun\u2019s colorful wood ramparts weren\u2019t even built until 1976. That\u2019s because it was built to satisfy feng shui principles more than accommodate traffic.\nWhile you\u2019re on the gate, enjoy the view because soon you\u2019ll be breathing heavily. Your reward for the climb? Spectacular views of the city! And before you know it, we\u2019ll reach Baegakmaru, the name of Bugaksan\u2019s 342-meter peak. At this point, Namsan Seoul Tower is to the left and Gwanghwamun Square and Gyeongbokgung Palace are right below us!\nThe trip back down is pretty steep, but along the way you can enjoy the view of Bukhansan\u2019s (Mt.) dorsal fin-shaped peak.

The gate\u2019s wooden top section dates to 1741, which makes it the oldest of Seoul Fortress\u2019s remaining gates. Under the archway are colorful painted phoenixes \u2013 or maybe they\u2019re roosters?\nUp ahead is another tunnel, which marks the entrance into Buam-dong. This quiet neighborhood feels far from downtown Seoul. Indeed, one shop owner described it as, \u201ctoo quiet for a serious business.\u201d Maybe so, but it\u2019s a great place for lunch! Case in point is Cheers!, which specializes in some of the crispiest and juiciest fried chicken Seoul has to offer. It\u2019s served alongside amazing fried potato wedges and a spicy-sweet dipping sauce and tastes great with a pint of draft beer. That sounds like the perfect way to celebrate our successful hike!\nWhen you walk underneath Changuimun\u2019s grand arch, you\u2019ll see two winged beasts. While they\u2019re not dragons, some think the official explanation is dubious. According to the signboards, the colorful animals are phoenixes, the mythical firebird from ancient cultures ranging from Egypt to China. But a folk tale suggests a more humble heritage. The birds are possibly chickens \u2013roosters, to be exact. Given the Fortress\u2019 long, centipede-like shape, its natural enemy would be the rooster. Achieving balance \u2013 the yin and yang \u2013 was of critical importance in ancient Korea, so Changuimun\u2019s chickens were said to repress the centipede\u2019s energy, thus creating harmony. So, what do you think they look like?\nIf fried chicken doesn\u2019t suit you, next-door is Rabia, which serves yummy Italian fare. Or, turn right at the intersection to find a couple of restaurants, caf\u00e9s, a bakery specializing in cupcakes and a flower shop on the main drag. If a jolt of caffeine is what you need, across the street from Cheers! is Club Espresso, a large caf\u00e9 that\u2019s been dedicated to the fine art of coffee since 1990. Got even more time to burn? Check out the popular Whanki Museum.\nBefore the post-lunch sleepiness sets in, let\u2019s get back on the road. This time it\u2019s a walk down a tree-lined street boasting great views of red tile roofs and the city. We\u2019ll pass a bronze statue of Police Commissioner Choi Gyu-sik who was killed by North Korean spies in 1968.\nAfter about a kilometer, we\u2019ll arrive at Cheongwadae Sarangchae, an exhibition and museum space showcases the history of the Korean presidency, government initiatives and aspects of Korean culture that are popular around the globe. The word \u201csarangchae\u201d refers to a detached room in traditional Korean manors where men would entertain fellow male guests.\nOnce we\u2019ve had our fill of the exhibits, I suggest checking out the souvenir store that\u2019s located next to the lobby. There\u2019s a surprising mix of interesting and high-quality items about Seoul and Korea. It\u2019s a great place to stock up on gifts for family and friends back home!\nAlthough Gyeongbokgung Palace was originally built in the late 14th century, it was burned to the ground during Japan\u2019s Hideyoshi invasions after some 200 years. When King Gojong rebuilt the palace in 1868, he created a virtual city with over 300 buildings covering 64 hectares. In fact, ancient Seoul\u2019s five palaces formed a royal compound that was second only to Beijing\u2019s Forbidden City. Sadly, when the Japanese government annexed Korea in 1910, it razed 90% of the royal buildings and gardens.\nToday, both the president\u2019s official residence, Cheongwadae, and the Cheongwadae Sarangchae are located on former palace grounds.\nOnce we\u2019ve finished our tour of the Cheongwadae Sarangchae, our tour is almost complete! But before we say goodbye, let\u2019s take a final stroll along another famous city wall. It\u2019s not part of the fortress wall, but it\u2019s the stately western wall of Gyeongbokgung Palace. Gyeongbokgung was the primary royal residence of Seoul during the late Joseon Dynasty. At the end of the wall is a busy intersection. Turn right and you\u2019ll quickly reach exit 4 of Seoul Metro Line 3\u2019s Gyeongbokgung Station.\n\u2026which is where our tour of Seoul\u2019s fortress and palace walls comes to an end!\nI hope you enjoyed seeing the city with me.\nThanks for coming along and let\u2019s do it again soon!<|endoftext|>(Bank draft | Commercial) If one sees himself paying someone a fee to write him a bill of exchange, or a bank draft in a dream, it means that he will borrow some money to do business and that he will profit from his investment to become known in his field.

Chef Park continues to travel to Italy every year to learn regional cuisines and develop new dishes for Gallina Daisy. The restaurant is a converted 1950\u2019s residence in the Hanok-filled neighborhood of Seochon. The main dining hall is located on the first floor, the second floor provides dining rooms open for cooking classes, and the third floor is a private dining space that offers an amazing view of Inwangsan mountain. The softly-lighted dining hall and dark-wood furniture create a warm, inviting atmosphere accompanied by elegant dishes.\nGallina Daisy strives to serve seasonal Italian pastas using simple but flavorful local ingredients. Chef Park believes Italian food doesn\u2019t require imported ingredients from Europe, and instead, incorporates Jeju black pork, local fish, pork from Jirisan and other ingredients from around the country. One great example is the fish carpaccio dish that\u2019s both local and seasonal. Another signature dish is the spaghetti with bottarga, zucchini and Moresca olive oil. The bottarga, or mullet roe, is air-dried in Jirisan with moonbaeju. The flavors come solely from the fresh ingredients as the kitchen doesn\u2019t use artificial seasoning. Everything is made on site, from the breads to the desserts.\nCaf\u00e9 Dimi is a neighborhood stalwart. Numerous bistros and caf\u00e9s have come and gone in the Seochon area, but Dimi has stayed its course, serving fresh pastas, pizzas and wine at surprisingly affordable prices for nearly a decade. It\u2019s easy to pass by the corner-shop restaurant as there\u2019s no blaring sign. Neighborhood regulars know that the food is great, but the caf\u00e9 views of Gyeongbok-palace road are hard to top. Grab a seat by the window at dusk and drink in the Seochon views as you dig into their pastas and pizzas.\nEach morning, the Dimi kitchen is busy at work making the doughs for their pastas, pizzas and breads. The restaurant focuses on quality ingredients that are local, seasonal and organic. They realize that while Seochon is a popular day-tripper neighborhood, the key to survival is to attract dangol or regular customers. Dimi does this with good quality sandwiches, pastas and pizzas around the KRW 10,000 price range. The lovely views come free of charge.<|endoftext|>This slip-on boot keeps it simple \u2014 clean lines, a perfect fit, and splash-ready protection.

The new Midlock grip features the deepest pistol dimension allowed by the USGA and is positioned sideways which pushes the shaft angle away from the forearm to reduce the typical 9 degrees of loft in as seen in an Armlock putter to just 4 degrees. This comfortable and effective setup produces a much more consistent one-piece putting stroke for reliability at short and long ranges.\nThe face used in ER11v MidLock features variable groove separations across the width of the face. By having deeper, and wider spaced grooves in the centre with shallower, more frequent groove spacing towards the heel and toe, golfers can rely on much greater consistency and ball speeds even on off-centre strikes.\nER11 v1 has a dual black and classic silver satin finish which perfectly contrast together for exceptional ease of alignment, particularly over short putts.\nWith a toe hang of 7\u00b0 this putter suits players with a slight rotation in their stroke.<|endoftext|>Stanbic Bank Botswana, a member of Standard Bank Group; the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), the U.S. Government\u2019s development finance institution; and Botswana Finance LLC, a subsidiary of Lazare Kaplan International (LKI), have signed a $ 125 million loan guarantee, which will encourage and support lending to diamond manufacturers and polishing companies while allowing the organisations to share credit risk.\nThe aim is to encourage diamond beneficiation, promote job creation locally and help in diversification of the economy, drive the development of the local financial sector and give local companies access to financing, the three partners noted.\nIn keeping with Standard Bank\u2019s objective of driving growth in Africa, Stanbic Bank has been lending to diamond beneficiation companies in Botswana for over ten years and this facility will support and allow the expansion of availability of financing for the sector.\nThis is the second tranche of a $ 250 million OPIC loan guaranty \u2013 the first of which was fulfilled by Barclays Bank of Botswana in 2016.<|endoftext|>A Staffworks expanded executive team reflects an aggressive growth initiative.\nTodd has 27 years of experience in staffing services and has held various Staffworks management positions for 19 years.

Keep up the good work and thank you so much.\nAwesome, thanks Fikri, glad you enjoyed it. Cheers!\nThanks for writing this blog, you have provided very detailed information and it was very helpful.\nCheers RaKee, glad to hear it!\nThank you for this really useful guide! I just hiked the Sadang trail today and because I didn\u2019t have any WiFi or data, I was reliant on your photos to help me find the way. Super fun and I loved climbing up all the rocks. Thanks again!\nCheers Anna, the Sadang route is such a great hike, glad you enjoyed it!\nHi Simon, thanks for that wonderful description. I really want to hike the Sadang route, do you think it would be safe to hike it alone? When I hiked up Samseongsan from Anyang, I was shocked by how little trail markings there were. I sort of got lost and climbed up unsecured rocks that did not seem like they were part of the official trail. I like rock climbing, but I\u2019d like to avoid getting lost if possible, haha. Is the trail marked well?\nAnd another question: I want to see the sunrise over Seoul, do you know a good spot to do that now in Summer? You said something about hiking only part of Sadang trail up to a viewpoint after some metal stairs. You think I would be able to see the sunrise from there? And is there some rock climbing prior to those stairs? I have good head lamps, so I am not worried about some simple hiking, but rocks are out of the question in the dark, I suppose. Thank you!\nHi Anna, sorry for the slow reply, blogging\u2019s on the backburner a bit due to the pandemic.\nI\u2019ve never done a sunrise hike in Seoul, but if I did I think Gwanaksan from Sadang would be the one I\u2019d go for. The viewpoint at the top of the steps would be a nice sunrise spot, sure \u2013 I\u2019ve been up there for sunset, as you can see in the pics.\nThe main trails are generally very obvious (though I\u2019ve checked out a couple of more minor ones and those are much rougher) and well signed, but if you look at the 18th image on this page you can see the broken signpost \u2013 they should\u2019ve fixed it by now, but if not you could get thrown off course there so be careful with that.\nIf you turn left at that signpost, in front of you is the rock scramble shown in the next image (19th down from the top) with the steps & flag at the top of the rocks. That\u2019s the main rock scramble until the final summit section, so take a look at the rocks in that pic and decide if you\u2019re happy to tackle those in the dark and base your decision on that.<|endoftext|>Last year Disney began active development of a film tenuously connected to the Disneyland Matterhorn ride.

Either the reputation mechanic should be applied game-wide or it should be discarded altogether.\nThis is the logic behind \"zero tolerance\" policies and other nonsensical behaviors where people substitute strict enforcement of one-size-fits-all rules for actual intelligence and good judgement. It's certainly easier to implement all-or-nothing rules, but easier is not synonymous with better. Carefully managed exceptions make almost any rule better when looking at real world outcomes.\nThere are 9 grey hexes on the map. I specifically chose them because they're rare and avoidable, and could not become the exception that devoured the rule. The only way 9 FFA hexes could transform the norm would be if a major fraction of the population was clustering into those hexes, presumably because they're having fun there.\nI would go so far as to say that the point of having a reputation system that punishes PvP in a game that desires to use PvP as it's primary content is to have exceptions for meaningful cases.\nI think a tiny fraction of the map with highly valuable resources in comparison to the rest of the map constitute an area where all PvP is meaningful, so the lack of a rep hit makes perfect sense.\nWhen you have areas people know they can go to to enjoy a high probability of PvP and get great loot, that is a mechanic which provides a carrot to engage in meaningful PvP against targets who know they are putting themselves in danger, as opposed to meaningless PvP against random targets.\nYour arguments for FFA PvP in these hexes make no sense. A person will have to invest heavily to be able to gather these resources whereas you think you get to just take your PvP skills and attack without loss? This is not meaningful in the way the system has been described to us. It is an attempt to veil the desire to be a Murderhobo. There will be plenty of fighting and murders over these resources as is and the investment in skills to gather these resources should not mean your just everyone's victim. You want meaningful FFA mechanics build it into player settlements of the low reps where greedy high reps might want to make money but need large guard forces not to just be more cash in the bandits pocket.

        "passage": " divided. When that happens, leaders face a dilemma: they can advocate for the point of view they think is right, or they can work to hold the community together. Most of the time community is more important\u2014but not always.\nSome fences are just too hard to straddle. It\u2019s fine to say, \u201cWe\u2019re one big family. We agree to disagree.\u201d But when the disagreement is about a matter of fundamental principle, such as who can be recognized as a full member of the family, it\u2019s not so simple.\nToday a number of denominations\u2014including the United Methodist Church\u2014are struggling over how and whether to ordain gay and lesbian people. The easiest difference for outsiders to see is simply between \u201cprogressives\u201d who want to recognize a wider range of people and \u201cconservatives\u201d who hold to older standards of acceptable behavior.\nBut another difference is more visible to the participants themselves\u2014between those whose first priority is to achieve what they think is the right outcome and those who want to hold the community together.\nI first encountered this dilemma when I was in college, writing for the student paper. The local Episcopal church was divided over women\u2019s ordination. Almost all the members of that congregation agreed that the church should ordain women\u2014but some wanted it to happen through an orderly decision process while others insisted it should happen right away.\nThis situation was hard to explain to my student editors, who kept trying to simplify the story into a battle between \u201cliberals\u201d and \u201cconservatives.\u201d It was hard for them to understand how anyone was willing to live with the suppression of women\u2019s gifts and calling\u2014even temporarily\u2014if that\u2019s what it took to bring everyone along.\nChurch or sect?\nSome faith traditions specialize in righteous action to right wrongs, while others favor unity, even at the cost of ambiguity about important points. Each denomination transmits family traditions about how to handle this dilemma, often by telling stories about faith heroes.\nIf we talk about prophetic souls who clung to the right even unto martyrdom, we frame ourselves as a \u201csect\u201d\u2014an outpost of purity against prevailing views. But if we speak with pride of famous presidents and business leaders who once belonged to our faith group, or recall the days when the town high school held its graduation in our sanctuary, we\u2019re seeing ourselves in \u201cchurchly\u201d terms\u2014as a religious home for everyone in the community.\nOf course none of us inherits one tradition pure. Most of us resonate with both the \u201csect\u201d idea of holding to the right regardless of the cost and the \u201cchurchly\u201d hope of holding a diversity of viewpoints under one big tent. We all know people who belong to congregations for all kinds of reasons\u2014habit, family, music\u2014that have little to do with their opinions on theology or social issues.\nWho counts as a member?\nThe broad-church style has great appeal: \u201cIf we agree in love, no disagreement can do us any harm. If we do not agree in love, no other agreement can do us any good.\u201d This broad-church sentiment and others like it have been attributed to the founders of a number of denominations.\nBut the \u201cchurchly\u201d way of understanding faith community is often founded on unstated assumptions about who counts as a full member. Once upon a time it seemed normal to ask a woman to join a church that put a ceiling on her leadership. More recently, congregations plausibly could say they loved gay people\u2014so long as they stayed closeted and celibate. Still today, many congregations that claim to be inclusive hold transgender people at arm\u2019s length.\nThe \u201cbroad church\u201d idea depends on a certain level of consensus about who counts. That\u2019s why many of our most established churches split over slavery and the Civil War, and it\u2019s why so many churches have split\u2014or will split soon\u2014over boundaries to inclusion based on sexuality and gender. When people become fully visible, it is no longer plausible to claim to be inclusive while excluding them.\nIn our time, when religious affiliation has become an option rather than an obligation, congregations need to declare their principles out loud in order to project a clear identity. This situation favors splitting over holding too wide a range of viewpoints in one space. Two congregations, each committed to consistent principles, may fare better in a marketplace of people who increasingly demand reasons to affiliate at all.\nFor leaders, straddling the fence feels sensible and safe. A little ambiguity can go a long way when it comes to holding a community together. Until it doesn\u2019t. Some issues are too central to a congregation\u2019s purpose and identity to fudge. Excluding people in the name of keeping \u201ceverybody\u201d under one big tent makes no sense at all.\nOne of my church clients posed a profound question to itself: \u201cWhat are the core values for which we would sacrifice our unity?\u201d It\u2019s a worthwhile question for a congregation of integrity to ponder. Straddling the fence can be a good move tactically, but sometimes leaders have to make a choice.<|endoftext|>Hiking Seoul Fortress (\uc11c\uc6b8\uc131\uacfd) is one of the best ways to experience a conspicuous remnant of Seoul\u2019s ancient past.\nFirst constructed in 1396 \u2013 just five years after King Taejo founded the Joseon Dynasty \u2013 the earthen wall was built to join the ridge lines of the four small mountains that surrounded Seoul proper \u2013 Namsan (\ub0a8\uc0b0) in the south, Inwangsan (\uc778\uc655\uc0b0) to the west, Naksan (\ub099\uc0b0) to the east, and Bugaksan (\ubd81\uc545\uc0b0) in the North.\nAlthough much of the old Seoul Fortress wall has been torn down, significant portions remain and others are being rebuilt.\nAs you\u2019re hiking Seoul Fortress, you can tell from the size and shape of the stones which era in which it was built. The original walls, built in the late 14th century were constructed of medium-sized round stones held together by mud.\nThe next major expansion, which took place during King Sejong the Great\u2019s reign in the mid 15th century, are marked by rectangular stones closely fit together.\nAnother major restoration in 1704 was when King Sukjong rebuilt sections of the wall using large, uniform stone slabs joined so tightly that even a sheet of paper can\u2019t fit in-between.\nAmong what\u2019s left of the Seoul Fortress wall, the stretch from Bugaksan to Inwangsan mountains provide some of the best preserved stretches that, along with spectacular views, make for a great day hike.\nRecently reopened to the public, the trail begins at Waryong Park (\uc640\ub8e1\uacf5\uc6d0). Turning left after a short break in the wall, the trail leads past a virtual tunnel of blooming vines.\nA boardwalk extends throughout the forest, whose canopy provides welcome relief from the summer sun. After several hundred meters, the forest gives way to open sky, and the upscale neighborhood of Seongbuk-dong (\uc131\ubd81\ub3d9) comes into view.\nOnce you reach the Sukjeongmun gate Rest Area, it\u2019s mandatory that visitors register with the office. It takes just a couple of minutes to furnish your passport, provide your contact information, receive a badge, and then your on your way to see the Great Northern Gate, Sukjeongmun (\uc219\uc815\ubb38).\nAmong the four main gates that mark each of the cardinal points, Sukjeongmun is the smallest. Primarily constructed to comply with geomantic principles, it\u2019s mountain-top location meant it didn\u2019t see much traffic.\nNevertheless, from its perch on the slopes of Bugaksan, a great view of northern Seoul can be had.\nWhile hiking Seoul Fortress, every 200 meters or so you\u2019re bound to see a young man patrolling the area.\nFriendly but hardly chatty, their presence reminds you that this area just north of the presidential house and less than two hours from the border with North Korea, remains a highly sensitive area as it was centuries ago.\nWith that in mind, photos are, for the most part, restricted, but the views from on high are definitely worth the trek, even if you can\u2019t keep a memento.\nAfter reaching Bugaksan\u2019s 342 meter peak, it\u2019s time to wind your way back down. As the trail becomes increasingly steep, you\u2019ll thank me for taking you on the westward route.\nAfter the precipitous descent, the stately secondary gate of Changuimun (\ucc3d\uc758\ubb38) signals your arrival in the peaceful hamlet of Buam-dong (\ubd80\uc554\ub3d9), and just in time for lunch!\nOpen: Most sections are open 24 hours.

        "passage": " divided. When that happens, leaders face a dilemma: they can advocate for the point of view they think is right, or they can work to hold the community together. Most of the time community is more important\u2014but not always.\nSome fences are just too hard to straddle. It\u2019s fine to say, \u201cWe\u2019re one big family. We agree to disagree.\u201d But when the disagreement is about a matter of fundamental principle, such as who can be recognized as a full member of the family, it\u2019s not so simple.\nToday a number of denominations\u2014including the United Methodist Church\u2014are struggling over how and whether to ordain gay and lesbian people. The easiest difference for outsiders to see is simply between \u201cprogressives\u201d who want to recognize a wider range of people and \u201cconservatives\u201d who hold to older standards of acceptable behavior.\nBut another difference is more visible to the participants themselves\u2014between those whose first priority is to achieve what they think is the right outcome and those who want to hold the community together.\nI first encountered this dilemma when I was in college, writing for the student paper. The local Episcopal church was divided over women\u2019s ordination. Almost all the members of that congregation agreed that the church should ordain women\u2014but some wanted it to happen through an orderly decision process while others insisted it should happen right away.\nThis situation was hard to explain to my student editors, who kept trying to simplify the story into a battle between \u201cliberals\u201d and \u201cconservatives.\u201d It was hard for them to understand how anyone was willing to live with the suppression of women\u2019s gifts and calling\u2014even temporarily\u2014if that\u2019s what it took to bring everyone along.\nChurch or sect?\nSome faith traditions specialize in righteous action to right wrongs, while others favor unity, even at the cost of ambiguity about important points. Each denomination transmits family traditions about how to handle this dilemma, often by telling stories about faith heroes.\nIf we talk about prophetic souls who clung to the right even unto martyrdom, we frame ourselves as a \u201csect\u201d\u2014an outpost of purity against prevailing views. But if we speak with pride of famous presidents and business leaders who once belonged to our faith group, or recall the days when the town high school held its graduation in our sanctuary, we\u2019re seeing ourselves in \u201cchurchly\u201d terms\u2014as a religious home for everyone in the community.\nOf course none of us inherits one tradition pure. Most of us resonate with both the \u201csect\u201d idea of holding to the right regardless of the cost and the \u201cchurchly\u201d hope of holding a diversity of viewpoints under one big tent. We all know people who belong to congregations for all kinds of reasons\u2014habit, family, music\u2014that have little to do with their opinions on theology or social issues.\nWho counts as a member?\nThe broad-church style has great appeal: \u201cIf we agree in love, no disagreement can do us any harm. If we do not agree in love, no other agreement can do us any good.\u201d This broad-church sentiment and others like it have been attributed to the founders of a number of denominations.\nBut the \u201cchurchly\u201d way of understanding faith community is often founded on unstated assumptions about who counts as a full member. Once upon a time it seemed normal to ask a woman to join a church that put a ceiling on her leadership. More recently, congregations plausibly could say they loved gay people\u2014so long as they stayed closeted and celibate. Still today, many congregations that claim to be inclusive hold transgender people at arm\u2019s length.\nThe \u201cbroad church\u201d idea depends on a certain level of consensus about who counts. That\u2019s why many of our most established churches split over slavery and the Civil War, and it\u2019s why so many churches have split\u2014or will split soon\u2014over boundaries to inclusion based on sexuality and gender. When people become fully visible, it is no longer plausible to claim to be inclusive while excluding them.\nIn our time, when religious affiliation has become an option rather than an obligation, congregations need to declare their principles out loud in order to project a clear identity. This situation favors splitting over holding too wide a range of viewpoints in one space. Two congregations, each committed to consistent principles, may fare better in a marketplace of people who increasingly demand reasons to affiliate at all.\nFor leaders, straddling the fence feels sensible and safe. A little ambiguity can go a long way when it comes to holding a community together. Until it doesn\u2019t. Some issues are too central to a congregation\u2019s purpose and identity to fudge. Excluding people in the name of keeping \u201ceverybody\u201d under one big tent makes no sense at all.\nOne of my church clients posed a profound question to itself: \u201cWhat are the core values for which we would sacrifice our unity?\u201d It\u2019s a worthwhile question for a congregation of integrity to ponder. Straddling the fence can be a good move tactically, but sometimes leaders have to make a choice.<|endoftext|>Hiking Seoul Fortress (\uc11c\uc6b8\uc131\uacfd) is one of the best ways to experience a conspicuous remnant of Seoul\u2019s ancient past.\nFirst constructed in 1396 \u2013 just five years after King Taejo founded the Joseon Dynasty \u2013 the earthen wall was built to join the ridge lines of the four small mountains that surrounded Seoul proper \u2013 Namsan (\ub0a8\uc0b0) in the south, Inwangsan (\uc778\uc655\uc0b0) to the west, Naksan (\ub099\uc0b0) to the east, and Bugaksan (\ubd81\uc545\uc0b0) in the North.\nAlthough much of the old Seoul Fortress wall has been torn down, significant portions remain and others are being rebuilt.\nAs you\u2019re hiking Seoul Fortress, you can tell from the size and shape of the stones which era in which it was built. The original walls, built in the late 14th century were constructed of medium-sized round stones held together by mud.\nThe next major expansion, which took place during King Sejong the Great\u2019s reign in the mid 15th century, are marked by rectangular stones closely fit together.\nAnother major restoration in 1704 was when King Sukjong rebuilt sections of the wall using large, uniform stone slabs joined so tightly that even a sheet of paper can\u2019t fit in-between.\nAmong what\u2019s left of the Seoul Fortress wall, the stretch from Bugaksan to Inwangsan mountains provide some of the best preserved stretches that, along with spectacular views, make for a great day hike.\nRecently reopened to the public, the trail begins at Waryong Park (\uc640\ub8e1\uacf5\uc6d0). Turning left after a short break in the wall, the trail leads past a virtual tunnel of blooming vines.\nA boardwalk extends throughout the forest, whose canopy provides welcome relief from the summer sun. After several hundred meters, the forest gives way to open sky, and the upscale neighborhood of Seongbuk-dong (\uc131\ubd81\ub3d9) comes into view.\nOnce you reach the Sukjeongmun gate Rest Area, it\u2019s mandatory that visitors register with the office. It takes just a couple of minutes to furnish your passport, provide your contact information, receive a badge, and then your on your way to see the Great Northern Gate, Sukjeongmun (\uc219\uc815\ubb38).\nAmong the four main gates that mark each of the cardinal points, Sukjeongmun is the smallest. Primarily constructed to comply with geomantic principles, it\u2019s mountain-top location meant it didn\u2019t see much traffic.\nNevertheless, from its perch on the slopes of Bugaksan, a great view of northern Seoul can be had.\nWhile hiking Seoul Fortress, every 200 meters or so you\u2019re bound to see a young man patrolling the area.\nFriendly but hardly chatty, their presence reminds you that this area just north of the presidential house and less than two hours from the border with North Korea, remains a highly sensitive area as it was centuries ago.\nWith that in mind, photos are, for the most part, restricted, but the views from on high are definitely worth the trek, even if you can\u2019t keep a memento.\nAfter reaching Bugaksan\u2019s 342 meter peak, it\u2019s time to wind your way back down. As the trail becomes increasingly steep, you\u2019ll thank me for taking you on the westward route.\nAfter the precipitous descent, the stately secondary gate of Changuimun (\ucc3d\uc758\ubb38) signals your arrival in the peaceful hamlet of Buam-dong (\ubd80\uc554\ub3d9), and just in time for lunch!\nOpen: Most sections are open 24 hours. However, the section between Waryong Park and Changuimun\u2019s hours vary. Closed Mondays.\nDirections: The Mt. Bugaksan section of the Seoul Fortress can be accessed via Anguk Station on Seoul Metro Line 3 (exit #2). Immediately outside the exit is a bus stop.

You might have noticed an exciting event coming to Saint Timothy\u2019s next Thursday, May 24th at 7:00 PM. We are excited to welcome Father Carlos Martins of the Companions of the Cross who will lead us in a teaching and an exposition of sacred relics. For centuries, people have recognized that there is something special and important about being around holy objects and holy people and their remains. The woman in the Gospel had a strong faith that if she could just touch the tassel of Christ\u2019s cloak, she could be healed. She was. Christians have long venerated the tombs and remains of the saints. As Christians and Catholics, we attach great importance to the body and physical expressions of the presence of the holiness of God.\nFor all of these reasons and more, we\u2019re excited to welcome an exposition of over 150 relics, some believed to be as old as 2000 years. We will have relics of Saint Augustine, Saint Teresa of Avila, Saint Maria Goretti, Saint Therese of Lisieux (the \u201cLittle Flower\u201d), Saint Francis of Assisi, Saint Anthony of Padua, Saint Thomas Aquinas, Saint Faustina Kowalska, and more.\nThere will be a presentation at 7:00 PM by Father Carlos in the main church and then time for personal veneration in the basement of the church following the presentation. I have heard many positive reviews about Father Carlos\u2019 and his presentation and we have already received phone calls about him coming, so it should be a good night.\nLearn about relics, why we venerate them, why they are important, why"

Steph was named to his first-team All Star in 2014, before storming the league to win the first of two consecutive MVP awards in 2015.\nAlthough this feat was the crowning achievement of his career at this point, Steph took the time to shout out to his then little-known brother, telling him and those listening to him that Seth\u2019s time was coming.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of you man. We had battles growing up, you challenged me every day when we played one-on-one in the backyard. Those battles I\u2019ll never forget,\u201d he said. he declared to Seth, who blinked back tears in the crowd.\n\u201cJust seeing how you\u2019ve grown and followed your career, it\u2019s not easy having an older brother who plays in the NBA and obviously your father, and the way you deal with him is impressive.\nSteph\u2019s words proved to be a watershed moment in Seth\u2019s own career. Young Curry lit up the NBA Summer League in the months following that MVP speech, before signing a guaranteed deal with the Sacramento Kings that would launch what has been an incredibly successful career in the league.\nFast forward a decade later, and Seth is a lethal weapon on the pitch that can\u2019t be ignored by full-fledged defenses.\nThe younger Curry is fourth overall all-time in playoff three-point percentage, having drilled more than 47% of his shots from long range in the biggest games of his career, a higher mark than the leader of all time in the game in three-pointers made, Steph.\nSeth has become a highly sought after role player, capable of complementing one of the league\u2019s biggest stars, and has played with the best of the best including Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid and Luka Doncic.\n\u201cHe\u2019s always been in my corner just to be honest,\u201d he said of Steph\u2019s 2015 MVP speech.\n\u201cIt was just that he was honest and even when I was trying to get to the NBA he and my dad were right in my corner and telling me they thought I was good enough to play in the NBA. just allowed to keep that trust and keep going and keep working hard.\n\u201cThat he says those words, it\u2019s not just things he says just to blow me away, he really really means what he says.\n\u201cI try to do the same and just be in his corner like when I\u2019m in the playoffs to watch his games. It\u2019s good to see him get back to the top and win another championship after the tough few years. that he had as a player and that they had as a team.\nDespite the obvious NBA pedigree, Seth doesn\u2019t believe a career in the league was inevitable, but thinks it made him more \u201crelative\u201d to the fans.\n\u201cI had to win every opportunity I had and I had to play well to have another chance to try to improve, so it made me appreciate where I am.\n\u201cI think it has also made me better, just playing for so many different teams, different coaches and different systems allows me to adapt to different roles and different situations.\n\u201cI think it all showed this season, being traded in the middle of the season and being able to come in and play well straight away.\nSeth has found himself in a bit of an odd position in the league, where his contract means he\u2019s constantly involved in trades, despite his production remaining at a high level.\nAfter signing a four-year, $32 million deal with the Dallas Mavericks in 2019, Seth was moved twice before the contract expired.\n\u201cThere are so many deals going on, you can sign a deal and be traded next month, so who knows,\u201d he said of his impending free agency decision.\n\u201cFor me, I\u2019m just trying to lock myself into this season and have fun. I would love to be in one place for a long time, but it\u2019s not really up to me.\n\u201cI played well in Dallas and Philadelphia, exceeded my contracts and still got traded. That\u2019s part of the game.\n\u201cThere are two ends to every story and obviously there are teams that trade me, but also the team that trades for me. They want me for a reason and they feel like I can help them, so that\u2019s where I see it.\nIf Seth is lucky in his next home, Stephen might not be the only one in the family sporting an NBA championship ring in the near future.\nFor a daily dose of the best news and exclusive content from Wide World of Sports, subscribe to our newsletter by click here!<|endoftext|>Automation and sector impacts research 2016: food manufacturing sector outlook (2016) The objective of this report is to provide an overview of the current level of adoption of automation in the Scottish food supply chain and identify how this might change over the period to 2025.

Recently, with the population increase in the metropolitan area, the air pollutants generated from China\u2019s industrialization have affected the region. With regard to the condition of Seoul\u2019s artificial environment, the population has increased sharply since 1965, and as of 2014, more than 10.36million people are living in the city. Automobiles, which are the main cause of air pollution, increased from 450,000 in 1985 to 3,010,000 in 2014, showing a 6.7-fold increase.\nExcept for the days when yellow-dust storms occur, the annual PM10 concentration in Seoul has shown a decreasing trend since 2003, and as of 2014, the fine-dust concentration is 44 \u338d/\u33a5. Fine dust shows a seasonal pattern. The fine-dust concentration is highest in spring due to the yellow dust, followed by winter, with the highly stagnant atmosphere frequency caused by heating and radiative cooling. Its concentration is lowest in summer, with high amounts of rainfall. In addition, fine dust has seasonal characteristics; its concentration is highest in spring, when yellow-dust storms frequently occur.\nTo prevent environmental damages due to fine dust, protect the health of the citizens, and create a comfortable environment, the government has established air quality standards and has ensured the adequate maintenance of the air quality in Seoul despite the changes in the environmental conditions. In 1993, fine dust (PM10) was included in the national air quality standards.\nIn addition, with the revision of the Environmental Policy Framework Act on December 4, 2006, an enhanced standard compared to the existing environmental standards has been applied from January 1, 2007, and ultra-fine dust (PM2.5), a new item, was added and has been applied from 2015.\nIn 2003, \u300eSpecial Act on Seoul Metropolitan Air Quality Improvement\u300f was established to improve the air quality in the capital area, where Seoul, Incheon, and Gyeonggi provinces are located, and based on this, \u300eSeoul Metropolitan Air Quality Control Master Plan\u300f established in 2005 has set the target air quality improvement levels of PM10 40 \u338d/m3, NO2 22 ppb by 2014.\nThe detailed promotion plans of \u300eSeoul Metropolitan Air Quality Control Master Plan \u300f include the automobile management, including production and operation of cars and traffic demand management; the total load management for large establishment ; the small and pollution source management for small-and-midium sized enterprises and towns; and the eco-friendly energy and urban management projects.\nThe 2nd Seoul Metropolitan Air Quality Control Master Plan was established and announced in December 2013. The 2nd Special Measures for the Seoul Metropolitan Air Quality Improvement with the target period 2015-2024 switched the policy direction from target concentration management to risk to human health. According to the regulations on \u300eSpecial Act on Seoul Metropolitan Air Quality Improvement\u300f, Seoul\u2019s action plan for the 2nd Seoul Metropolitan Air Quality Management was established in 2014 to promote the 2nd Seoul Metropolitan Air Quality Control Master Plan, and detailed plans for the reduction of air pollutants by pollution source have been implemented to ensure eco-friendly traffic demand control through the attachment of diesel particulate filters (DPFs) to diesel vehicles for low pollution, post-management, strengthening of the allowable-emission criteria, spread of low-pollution vehicles, exhaust gas management, dissemination of the weekly no-driving day program, and review of the restrictions on driving diesel"

Since 1469, the ceremony has taken place and its record has been consulted for the present reenactment ceremony. The reenactment of the original ceremony began from 1996 and it catches the eyes of passersby, especially foreign tourists, when guardsmen perform the changing of guards in traditional costumes at the main gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace in downtown Seoul, so you can experience this traditional event in Seoul every day except Tuesday.\nThe signature markings of the Presidential Residence of Cheong Wa Dae are its blue tiles, so it is the first thing that catches one\u2019s attention upon entering the premises.

Knight, of course, was fired by the late IU president Myles Brand in September 2000 and the relationship between Knight and the university has not been repaired despite significant turnover in IU's upper administration, in the athletic department, and in the basketball program. This won't be the first time Knight has been in the building for an IU game since he was fired. Knight was present for IU's win over Pitt in the 2009-10 Jimmy V Classic at Madison Square Garden (and was quite complimentary of IU, despite his usual reticence about discussing IU), but he was part of the \"studio\" team that handled the halftime, pregame, and postgame shows, not the actual broadcast crew.\nThis will be very interesting. How will Knight handle it? Will he spend time with the team and the IU coaches, as is typical of commentators before a game? I'm looking forward to it. Knight is one of the best analysts in the business, and I'll be very interested to see what he has to say about the Hoosiers. I'm sure that both Fred Glass and Tom Crean are smart enough to avoid the hard sell with Knight, but hopefully there will be enough positive interaction to perhaps set the stage for a future trip to Assembly Hall by Knight.\nI know this topic is wearying for some of you. It is for me, too. IU has made steps toward a reconciliation, and ultimately the ball is in Knight's court. Knight isn't wrong to be bitter toward an institution that fired him. On the other hand, other fired legendary coaches, including Woody Hayes and Nolan Richardson, have eventually mended fences with their universities. A reconciliation between Knight and IU isn't the biggest deal in the world, but I think it would be nice both for Knight and IU fans.<|endoftext|>People that have trusted our consultants and won!\nNew for 2014, browse our online directory for Professionals that you can use to help grow your business!

Rotors are in great shape - they are the good old stuff that doesn't rust while your car sits there. Calipers, mounting brackets, pads and flex lines included, as is the intermediate flex line - all in great shape. When I bought the Lincoln rear I had these rotors turned and they have held up beautifully. Calipers were bought new by me as were the flex hoses and pads. These parts were on my car for about 5,000 miles over 17 years. Below is a diagram of the big bearing housing showing the dimensions of the rear these will fit. Price is $250 firm.\nBump for a nice setup that is taking up space in my garage.\nBump - also have stock 28 spline axles with bearings for this setup. Caliper brackets already installed. $325 for the whole package.\nWould these fit on a 77 Bronco???\nHi Sam - are you the same Sam from years ago who I sold Paisley concert tickets to?\nTo answer your question - check the bearing size diagram I posted above. If you have the big bearing housing shown, the brakes will bolt up. Not sure about your axles - you'd have to check to see if they are the same length as mine (78 Lincoln Versailles - 28 spline ). Let me know if you have any questions. I will help any way I can.\nYes the Same Sam as the Paisley tickets. My old sign must be corrupted and I cannot get the password to reset so I just make a new one. I will have to take some measurements and get back to you. Probably will not be until next weekend.\nQuestion. Are the line just rubber or Stainless braided?\nI thought that was you. Flex lines are stock style rubber. They are in great shape. Maybe check some Bronco forums and see if my axles will work for you. First thing to check is the bearing size - if that matches we might be in business. I can get pics of whatever you need. Just holler. You can text me if you want. 412-292-2403.\nRon, Just sent you a txt.\n$200 for everything including axles. Help me clean out my garage!!\n$150 for everything.

It also boasts the most powerful internals, featuring a A10 Fusion chip for iPad Pro level graphics and CPU performance.\nHowever, one strange omission in the current offering (Apple TV 4K starts shipping to customers tomorrow) is the lack of Dolby Atmos surround sound. Atmos is arguably the best consumer home theater audio setup currently available, building on top of Dolby 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound.\nHowever, the Apple TV 4K box does not support it. It supports the Dolby Vision 4K video format, but not its audio counterpart. The Verge says they asked Apple about this and the lack of support is not a hardware limitation and that Atmos sound would be added in future (\u2018support is on the roadmap\u2019).\nThe YouTube revelation is more fundamental, although there is a technical reason backing it. The Apple TV supports H.264, HEVC and MP4 video formats. YouTube serves 4K HDR video in the open-source VP9 format.\nAs a result, Apple TV 4K users will find that the YouTube app can only output upscaled 1080p. The ever-growing 4K YouTube video library is not available to Apple TV users.\nEither Apple needs to add VP9 decoding to the Apple TV or Google needs to upgrade the YouTube backend to serve compatible video streams to Apple users. Given the two company\u2019s frosty relations, who knows if that will ever happen.\nRead The Verge\u2019s full review for more details on the functionality and limitations of the Apple TV\u2019s varied format support.<|endoftext|>FLEXOVITAL+BEETROOT contains natural substances that are among the most appreciated natural remedies in the world.

The two countries have had rare direct contacts in recent days on U.S. earthquake relief aid.\nThe more positive tone toward Iran was sounded by Secretary of State Colin Powell, who told The Washington Post in an interview published Tuesday that \"encouraging\" moves by Iran have raised the possibility of dialogue between the two countries, which have not had diplomatic ties since 1980.\nU.S. officials say Mr. Powell was referring to, among other things, Iran's recent decision to allow snap international inspections of its nuclear facilities, and its acceptance of direct U.S. relief aid after last Friday's devastating earthquake.\nMr. Powell said the moves appear to show a \"new attitude\" in Iran, though not \"total generosity,\" on dealing with issues of concern to the United States and others. He said Washington should keep open the possibility of dialogue \"at an appropriate point in the future.\"\nThe Powell comments were echoed here by State Department spokesman Adam Ereli, who said U.S.-Iranian contacts on earthquake assistance and Tehran's nuclear inspection promises, are positive and encouraging signs that are worth noting.\nHowever, Mr. Ereli said that does not diminish the \"serious concerns\" the United States has about Iran's policy and behavior, including support for terrorism and efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction, and that action by Tehran will be needed if the relationship is to improve.\n\"What's important are actions,\" he said. \"What's important is seeing follow-through. What's important are meeting international commitments. And that's what we're looking for, in the area of WMD, in the area of stopping support for terrorists, in the area of cooperating in the fight against terrorism, particularly concerning al-Qaida leaders that Iran has information about. So these are all aspects of our policy that we want to see actions on.\"\nThe two countries, without formal relations for more than two decades, have had only occasional diplomatic contacts. But Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage telephoned Iran's U.N. ambassador, Mohammed Zarif, early Saturday in Tehran to offer earthquake assistance.\nThe Iranian official quickly called back with his government's acceptance, clearing the way for unprecedented direct U.S. relief flights to Iran.\nSpokesman Ereli said the American aid offer was strictly a humanitarian gesture and not motivated by political concerns. But he said Iran's acceptance cannot be seen as anything but a positive development.\nElements of an 84-member delegation of U.S. relief and rescue experts arrived at the earthquake scene in the southeastern Iranian city of Bam Tuesday. The Bush administration also committed additional material help, including thousands of blankets and hundreds of rolls of plastic sheeting to help shelter earthquake survivors.<|endoftext|>The former food court has become a public library.\nThe business I had in Seoul was at the World Trade Center Seoul located at the COEX so I was there everyday for 10 days...\nThis is good place to learn Korea culture and cusine as well as try Korean traditional costume....\nIt was fun to try the traditional outfits.

So, it\u2019s not surprising that you\u2019ll have a hard time deciding what exactly to do and where to go while you are in Seoul. That is why this blog exists, to help you out, and give you some ideas of what you could do for 5 days in Seoul.\nSouth Korea is known for its elegant traditional costume called \u2018hanbok\u2019. It\u2019s worn mostly during special occasions such as weddings, or family gatherings during Seolnal (Korean New Years) and Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving). That doesn\u2019t mean you have to celebrate these dates to wear them, because in Seoul you can rent a hanbok and roam around anywhere you like. There are multiple hanbok designs you can choose from so don\u2019t worry about not being able to find a pretty costume, because there are plenty of designs, from hanbok designs worn by ancient kings and queens of Korea to beautiful designs with patterns, flowers or pictures on them.\nThe Joseon Dynasty was the last kingdom in Korea. Over the reign of this dynasty, Seoul became the capital city and center of state affairs. Throughout the years, the kings had many grand palaces built here. 5 of them are currently open to the public, and did you know? When you rent a hanbok, entry into Korean palaces is free!\nRent your Korean Hanbok and roam around Seoul now!\nYou can also opt to wear Korean Hanbok and do a photoshoot in multiple locations around Seoul!\nHere are the 6 palaces you can visit on your first day.\nThis is the main royal palace and is also the largest of the 5.

Try to be there during the Royal Guard Changing Ceremonies.\nThe Royal Guard (Sumunjang) Changing Ceremony can be seen for free daily, except on Tuesdays, at 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM in front of Gwanghwamun. This is the main gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace. There is also a free guided tour of the Palace building in English. Check the schedule on the official website to make sure of the time slots.\nThis is the second royal palace built after the construction of Gyeongbokgung. It was the main palace for many kings of the Joseon Dynasty and is the most well-preserved of the 5 remaining palaces. It has been recognized as a World Cultural Heritage site by UNESCO in 1997.\nThe \u201cSecret Garden\u201d (Huwon) in Changdeokgung remains a little bit mysterious up until today because only a limited number of people are admitted each day. The Secret Garden boasts a gigantic tree that is over 300 years old, a small pond and a pavilion. It\u2019s a beautiful place to escape from the bustle of the city. Changdeokgung also offers a free guided tour of the palace building in English.\nThe palace is located at the corner of Seoul\u2019s busiest downtown intersection and is famous for its elegant stone-wall road. Many people come to Deoksugung to fetch Instagram-worthy profile pics here. The palace is also worth a visit because it is the only palace that sits alongside a series of western style buildings that blend in well and add to the uniqueness of the surrounding scenery.\nDeoksugung Palace has its own Changing of the Royal Guards Ceremony. It is held at 11:00 AM, 2:00 PM, and 3:30 PM daily, except on Mondays.\nChangyeongung palace is located in the heart of Seoul next to Changdeokgung. Both palaces used to share the rear garden and were commonly known as the East palaces as they were located to the east of the main Gyeongbokgung Palace. The palace was often used as residential quarters for queens and concubines. During the Japanese colonial rule, it became a park with a zoo and a botanical garden. In 1983 the government of Korea decided to remove the zoo and began working on the restoration of the palace. The botanical garden was preserved, gradually regaining its old glory.\nGyeonghuigung palace is located to the southwest of Gyeongbokgung Palace and towards Deoksugung palace. Gyeonghuigung palace served as the secondary palace for the king in the latter half of the Joseon period. The secondary palace is where the King would evacuate to in case of an emergency. It was also called \u2018Seogwol\u2019 meaning \u201cThe palace in the west\u201d, as at that time it was located on the west side of Seoul.\nUnhyeongung is one of the smaller palaces, a lot less touristic but is still beautiful to have a look through.

If you want to visit the palaces, then we recommend that you visit them with an accompanying guide, which you can find in the link below.\nBook your Korean Palace Tour now!\nThis place is another iconic place to visit in Seoul because the entire district is composed of traditional Korean houses called \u2018Hanok\u2019.

Try to be there during the Royal Guard Changing Ceremonies.\nThe Royal Guard (Sumunjang) Changing Ceremony can be seen for free daily, except on Tuesdays, at 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM in front of Gwanghwamun. This is the main gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace. There is also a free guided tour of the Palace building in English. Check the schedule on the official website to make sure of the time slots.\nThis is the second royal palace built after the construction of Gyeongbokgung. It was the main palace for many kings of the Joseon Dynasty and is the most well-preserved of the 5 remaining palaces. It has been recognized as a World Cultural Heritage site by UNESCO in 1997.\nThe \u201cSecret Garden\u201d (Huwon) in Changdeokgung remains a little bit mysterious up until today because only a limited number of people are admitted each day. The Secret Garden boasts a gigantic tree that is over 300 years old, a small pond and a pavilion. It\u2019s a beautiful place to escape from the bustle of the city. Changdeokgung also offers a free guided tour of the palace building in English.\nThe palace is located at the corner of Seoul\u2019s busiest downtown intersection and is famous for its elegant stone-wall road. Many people come to Deoksugung to fetch Instagram-worthy profile pics here. The palace is also worth a visit because it is the only palace that sits alongside a series of western style buildings that blend in well and add to the uniqueness of the surrounding scenery.\nDeoksugung Palace has its own Changing of the Royal Guards Ceremony. It is held at 11:00 AM, 2:00 PM, and 3:30 PM daily, except on Mondays.\nChangyeongung palace is located in the heart of Seoul next to Changdeokgung. Both palaces used to share the rear garden and were commonly known as the East palaces as they were located to the east of the main Gyeongbokgung Palace. The palace was often used as residential quarters for queens and concubines. During the Japanese colonial rule, it became a park with a zoo and a botanical garden. In 1983 the government of Korea decided to remove the zoo and began working on the restoration of the palace. The botanical garden was preserved, gradually regaining its old glory.\nGyeonghuigung palace is located to the southwest of Gyeongbokgung Palace and towards Deoksugung palace. Gyeonghuigung palace served as the secondary palace for the king in the latter half of the Joseon period. The secondary palace is where the King would evacuate to in case of an emergency. It was also called \u2018Seogwol\u2019 meaning \u201cThe palace in the west\u201d, as at that time it was located on the west side of Seoul.\nUnhyeongung is one of the smaller palaces, a lot less touristic but is still beautiful to have a look through. From here, you can make your way to Bukchon Hanok Village because it\u2019s very close to the village. If you want to visit the palaces, then we recommend that you visit them with an accompanying guide, which you can find in the link below.\nBook your Korean Palace Tour now!\nThis place is another iconic place to visit in Seoul because the entire district is composed of traditional Korean houses called \u2018Hanok\u2019. Bukchon is intertwined with many streets and alleys, and if you are lucky you may bump into a hidden hot place like a souvenir shop, a restaurant or a cafe that only a few people know!\nBukchon is also one of the best places to take beautiful photographs at. The walls of hanok are perfect backgrounds for a photo of you wearing elegant hanbok! It doesn\u2019t just offer great photo opportunities but you can do several activities as well!\n Since Seoul is large and there are so many places to go, going on a Seoul City Bus tour is convenient for you, since it\u2019ll take you to the landmarks and most famous places all over Seoul. Check out Han River, Namsan Mountain, and many more places! Take your time and check out the landmarks of Seoul!\nGet 17% OFF Discount Tickets to Seoul City Bus Tour!\nAnother place you could check out is the N Seoul Tower, which is one of the popular landmarks of Seoul. The tower is 480 m above sea level, and Namsan mountain, which is where the N Seoul Tower stands is one of the best places to get an overview of Seoul. The view both during the day and night are breathtaking in its own ways.\n~25% OFF Discount Tickets to N Seoul Tower Observatory!\nWith 63 floors measuring a total height of 249 meters, 63 Building is one of Korea\u2019s tallest and most recognized building. 63 building boasts spectacular views of the Han River and the surrounding Bugaksan, Namsan and Gwanaksan mountains. The building also offers an outstanding vantage point when viewing the sunset over the city, as well as an art gallery and aquarium.\nGet 25% OFF Discount Tickets to 63 Building Sky Art & Aqua Planet 63!\nJust like any other Asian countries, Seoul has no shortage of night markets, so why not drop by any of these night markets and take care of dinner!\nIt originally opened in Yeouido but has since expanded to several locations such as DDP, Banpo Hangang Park, Cheonggyecheon Stream, and Oil Tank Culture Park. It\u2019s not one of the old traditional markets you may expect to see, because it\u2019s not just food that you\u2019ll be able to find in the Bamdokkaebi Night Market. There are other areas in each of the areas that hold events or small performances on a stage provided, so it\u2019s a lot of fun!\nTake note that this is different from the Night Market in DDP! Apart from the retail haven found in this area, you will also find the \u2018Open market\u2019 with its bright tents, all selling various apparel, souvenirs and items at affordable prices starting from 10:00PM up to 5:00AM. If you\u2019re rather looking for delicious Korean eats, drop by Meokja Golmok at exit 8 of Dongdaemun Station to feast on Korean snacks to warm you up during the cold winters of Korea.\nEven if this is not one of those \u2018traditional\u2019 night markets, it remains to be a popular destination for travelers as it is set in the bustling shopping district of Myeongdong that holds some of the biggest stores like Lotte and Shinsegae Shopping Mall as well as cosmetic brands of all kinds. Food stalls will begin to open and fill up the main street once its time to open!\nOpen from 11:00PM till 4:00AM, this traditional night market is the largest in Seoul and it has every possible item you can think of \u2013 food, clothes, accessories, you name it! They have it all!\nIf Namdaemun is the largest, Gwangjang is the oldest in Seoul, making it a common go-to place for many Korean shoppers. You can actually find this place close by Dongdaemun and DDP so it\u2019s possible to check off several of those night markets on the same night if you wish. Gwangjang is one of the go-to places to look for either a light snack or take care of dinner! there are so many things to eat, that you\u2019ll have a hard time choosing what"

        "passage": " rashes, and sometimes more serious infections, that come with too few diaper changes, the fussiness, the crying, the feeling of failure because you cannot meet your child\u2019s most basic needs. I ended up buying diapers for the family out of my own pocket, a frequent strategy for social workers when they realize that there is no official channel prepared to give a client what they need. But I would not be her social worker forever. Plus, I knew that there would be millions of families around the country in exactly the same situation. What about them?\nI started looking into hygiene supplies, what they cost and what help there was for families who could not afford them. It was nearly impossible for people short on money to get these essential products. We talked about it a lot as a family, and in 2004 we decided to just get started. That meant going to the warehouse club, the cheapest place to buy diapers, and loading up our minivan with cases of them. We got close friends to do the same. The diapers ended up at our house. I added another line to our family cell phone plan, and that became the virtual headquarters of the Diaper Bank.\nIt got us going faster\u2014 with less need for our own infrastructure.\nIt allowed us to reach into corners of the community where our core group did not have connections.\nWe were able to support, rather than compete with, nonprofits already doing important work.\nOur diaper buyers and drivers became board members. We held diaper drives, raised money, and talked with the media about diaper need. Though I was living a diaper-centric life, it was never solely about diapers. I realized that the need for tampons, toothpaste, laundry detergent, and many other hygiene and household supplies was also urgent. But I chose to do one thing, and do it well, I hope, rather than split my focus.\nChoosing diapers was designed to raise public support and also maximize impact. Babies are sympathetic. Yes, I did get calls and letters from people who demonized the parents\u2014actually, almost exclusively the mothers\u2014for \u201chaving babies they cannot afford.\u201d But far more people were horrified at the idea of babies spending days in dirty diapers. Those people tended to be thinking of what it would be like for their own children and grandchildren to be in such dire straits. That kind of empathy is what continues to drive the diaper bank movement.\nIn taking on partner agencies, we built ourselves a base in the community. Nonprofits that people already considered essential considered the Diaper Bank essential. That helped us make connections to people who would give money, diapers, and professional services to help us grow.\nSoon we had some paid staff. While the growth was tremendous, we did not grow for the sake of growing. Staff spent most of their time ensuring that we were operating smoothly and providing as many diapers as possible to our partners\u2014not doing marketing.  Your first job is to build something that is worth marketing.\nThe Diaper Bank got a lot of attention, as I did personally. When national media covered our work, it created more opportunities. Eventually, a major diaper brand, Huggies, agreed to support me as I started the National Diaper Bank Network (NDBN). Today NDBN has more than two hundred member organizations in communities throughout the country. The national organization gives these local diaper banks access to huge diaper donations as well as technical assistance that helps them become strong and efficient nonprofits able to help their communities for the long haul. NDBN also does policy advocacy on behalf of families in poverty, particularly around hygiene needs. Some of the key players in the diaper bank movement have years of policy experience, advanced degrees, and connections to large organizations. Others have no real preparation for the work but draw on their own experience of poverty, or simply their good hearts, and they set up distribution programs run out of church basements or their own garages. They come from all religious and political persuasions. Together, we\u2019ve given out more than two hundred million diapers since 2011. We recently started the Alliance for Period Supplies to get these essential products to the one in four menstruators who say they\u2019ve had to do without them.\nDiaper banking is what this entire book is about: the idea that there are necessities beyond the means of people in poverty and no public programming to help them bridge that gap. Without these necessities, people miss work and school. They get sick. They sink deeper into poverty. We have proved that families who receive free diapers earn more money and have healthier children. Parents report that they and their children are \u201chappier\u201d as a result of the diapers. You can help people work their way out of poverty, just by giving them diapers. By taking away one of the stressors that comes with poverty, you can make a home a much more developmentally healthy place for a baby to grow up. Giving people diapers does not solve everything. But it solves quite a bit.\nJoanne Goldblum is CEO and founder of the National Diaper Bank Network.<|endoftext|>At 5.50am every morning, the sun begins its gradual ascent over Inwangsan\u2019s northwestern face, the mountain\u2019s gentle incline offers a perfect view of Seoul as the city begins to stir and wake for the new day. The Seoul skyline is different from others. Unlike New York City or Tokyo, the city\u2019s profile is wave-like and rugged; seemingly a geographical manifestation of the creative and industrious nature of its people.\nFollowing the Korean War, South Korea began as an agriculture-based economy in the 1960s, despite only having 30 per cent land area available for cultivation. Recognising its massive reliance on the industry, the country turned to an economic model in the coming years of substituting foreign import with domestic production and manufacturing, devoting profits generated during this time to the construction of physical infrastructure.\nThe astonishing economic development of Korea is famously dubbed \u2018The Miracle on The Han River\u2019, modelled in name after West Germany\u2019s \u2018Miracle on The Rhine\u2019 in the 1950s. It is another body of water, however, that has played perhaps a more influential role in South Korea\u2019s rapid development. Had it not been for the Han\u2019s geographical fortune of flowing through Seoul, \u2018The Miracle at the Port of Busan\u2019 would\u2019ve been a more fitting, albeit less-catchy name for the country\u2019s post-war economic triumph.\nThe Nakdong River flows from the Taebaek Mountains in the northeast to the southern tip of the Korean peninsula, as the river empties out into the Korea Strait. At its mouth lies the Port of Busan, the sixth-busiest port in the world. First established as a Japanese-exclusive port in 1876, trade running through its waters have been the lifeblood of Korea\u2019s gargantuan export capability for decades. As of June 2022, South Korea has reportedly exported a whopping 57.7 billion USD worth of trade, with the Port of Busan facilitating over 75 per cent of container cargo that enters or exits the country.\nKorea\u2019s top exports are manufactured electrical machinery and equipment, with the outgoing trade of integrated circuits alone worth 89.9 billion USD annually. Through manufacturing software and hardware, the country has established itself as an economic powerhouse with a technological edge. Large conglomerates such as Samsung and the LG Group have traditionally dominated the technological sphere, but a growing digital revolution in the form of next-generation industries such as payment technologies and fintech have shifted the industry\u2019s focus.\nThis has accelerated the demand for digital infrastructure, providing opportunity for the data center market to grow in the country. Coupling this with one of the best tech infrastructures worldwide and a foreign investment-friendly market, Korea has been easy-on-the-eye and enticing to companies such as Digital Realty and China Telecom, with facilities sprouting across the country and blueprints for more in place.\nInterrupting the bright optimism surrounding the industry\u2019s future in South Korea however, have been global supply chain issues. In a time of global inflation and growing uncertainty, the thriving popularity of the sector has spread its logistical network thin, with the sourcing of raw materials, manufacturing of equipment and shipping pushed towards full throttle.\nExternal influences such as Covid-19 and the Russo-Ukraine conflict have further complicated an already-stretched supply chain, from the lack of parking space for container ships to a decade-high global price on steel. Data center companies have reported being 14 per cent over budget due to increased labour and component costs, with hardware vendors reportedly increasing costs by 7 to 12 per cent since the beginning of 2022. Delays have also been observed, with generator shortages and core networking equipment taking as long as seven months to be shipped.\nThe pinch has also been felt in Korea. As recently as June, the waiting time for export container ships at the Port of Busan swelled to 11 days, as compared to the normal median of three. Despite being a producer of electronic equipment, much of the raw materials needed for data center related-production is imported from China, where recent Covid-19 lockdown measures have ground the country to a halt.\nComplete immunity is never granted to any industry nor country; careful planning and contingency measures have to be employed to deal with unfavourable conditions. Singapore announced plans for a 40-billion USD automated port project this June- the world\u2019s largest when completed by 2040. Hong Kong has recently adopted the clever solution of addressing space constraints in the data center market by retrofitting existing industrial buildings.\nIn a fervently competitive environment, innovation and perseverance will continue to be essential ingredients in South Korea\u2019s keeping up with the times.

It\u2019s more of a placeholder because other designations to describe our hobby don\u2019t fit. Urban exploration is a catch-all term to describe the investigation of human-made structures. An urban explorer explores drains, cranes, catacombs, rooftops, tunnels, and my favorite, abandonments. Despite containing the word \u201curban,\u201d locations are not strictly limited to the city, nor are they bounded to neglected structures. There are plenty of forgotten yet active places in rural settings as well.\nA section of the Bukhansanseong shot on a Ricoh R1E with Kentmere 400 film.\nI\u2019ve always held Korea\u2019s mountains in high regard; I used to near the foothills and the Suyu-side of Bukhansan National Park. On the days where I didn\u2019t work until the afternoons, I would take advantage of the free mornings and hike up the various trails leading up to the ridge. On weekends, I\u2019d make the trek up to Baekundae(\u767d\u96f2\u81fa \ubc31\uc6b4\ub300), putting up with the crowds to the top. I can also say I\u2019ve hiked every prominent mountain in the Seoul area. Before urban exploring took up most of my free time, hiking played a central role on weekends and off days. I\u2019ve always loved hiking in Korea\u2019s wilderness, despite having to compete with the crowds.\nA decent into the valley. Further on, we would find a cave used in shamanic rites.

The most common structures you will find are pillboxes, trenches, and guard towers built after the Korean War. ind old burial mounds throughout the hills and mountains in Korea. Some are well taken care of, like the graves of Korean Independence fighters. In contrast, nature is reclaiming the mounds of ordinary folks buried before the modernization of Korea. Isaiah Winters wrote about locating an abandoned goldmine dating back to the colonial era outside of Gwangju. I tagged along with him early on to find it, but we came up empty on that day. It didn\u2019t matter because we found some shamanic shrines to photograph, so the trip was a win in my book; This brings me to a new focus in my future explorations of Korea: shamanic sites in the mountains!\nLast year, I wrote about exploring Inwangsan to find rediscovered Sanshin on the mountain. It took multiple trips, but I eventually found all three Mountain God carvings along with a hard-to-reach Mireuk (Maitraya, Future Buddha) Bosal. This experience tied together my love of Korean folk religion, hiking, and exploring.\nDespite some lingering haze, there was some picturesque views of the mountains. Once again shot on an Olympus XA2 with Kodak Color Plus 200.\nWhat a joy it was when in June, I was able to synthesize all my interests once again in a hike organized by Shawn Morrissey. Shawn is a folklorist that runs the Seoul Hike Tour through Bukhansan National Park. Along with Joe McPherson, he runs the Dark Side of Seoul ghost walk tour and hosts the podcast of the same name. I have yet to go on the ghost walk, but it sounds pretty fun! Their podcast is informative and entertaining, especially for someone who wants to learn more about Korea other than K-Pop and the Dongdaemun Design Plaza. In their series on the disasters that shaped modern Korea, you see the tragedies occur because leaders made the same mistakes repeatedly. Also, they interview some guy about urban exploring in Korea.\nBack to the hike, on a warm, smoggy day, I met up with Shawn to lead me along a trail while telling folk stories related to the mountains and the region. I had never much hiked the Western side of Bukhansan before; as mentioned earlier, I pretty much entered from the Eastern side, so it was a treat to walk a route I\u2019ve never been on before. Despite the haze sticking around most of the day, it was a great day. It was a pleasure meeting Shawn and talking with him about the field of heritage interpretation, Korean folklore, and how urban exploration in Korea is an avenue to see modern Korea deal with its chaotic past.\nShawn taking in the view. Shot while sitting in an awkward position with the Olympus XA/Color Plus combo.\nI kick myself for writing this so long after the fact. I will try my best to relate what information I retained, but the pictures will be talking for the most part. In going through these pictures, I am committed to hiking more this fall.

This left the Leopards with a usual pre-match hike to find the precariously perched smaller than usual football turf. To add to the uniqueness of the situation the goal posts were on wheels giving an extra 5 inches to of height and offering the distinct possibility that they might move at any time.\nAfter watching the girls chalk up yet another win (4-0) in their stroll, to the title, the boys were hoping to emulate their longer haired classmates and get the job done. Lining up in a new look 3-5-2 formation Mr. Dawson\u2019s troops were ready for a physical battle with time and space likely at a premium on this 9-a-side surface.\nDulwich College Seoul started brightly, knocking the ball about nicely, moving it intelligently to the wings where the full-backs were getting plenty of joy against a lumbering ICS-U rearguard. However, whenever a chance presented itself the finish was lacking, Edgar, Kris, Eric, Kaleb, Nacho and Paul all failed to convert from promising positions.\nThe longer the game remained goalless the more Uijeongbu grew in confidence and they hit Dulwich College Seoul with a classic sucker punch just before the break. A defensive mix up left an Eagles player completely unmarked and he did what the home side had failed to do, slotting confidently passed a helpless Reuben. The half-time whistle quickly greeted a hot and frustrated Leopards side who had hoped for a much easier afternoon.\nUnder the expectant eye of the Head of College Mr Salt, they made the perfect start to the second period with enigmatic frontman Roy catching a left-footed half-volley right on the sweet spot to level the match 1-1. This should have been the perfect platform to go on and seize control of the match, yet instead Dulwich College Seoul hit the self-explode button. First they failed to close down a shooter on the edge of the box, secondly, they gave away a free kick on the edge of the box and finally the defense dillied and dallied leaving a grateful Eagles\u2019 player to soar in and clip the ball into an unguarded net. 1-4. A mountain bigger than Gwanaksan to climb and little time left.\nAs the clock ticked away, the last throw of the dice from Dulwich College Seoul head coach Mr Dawson saw Wandrille and Kris replace the flagging Paul and Roy up front. It was these two who combined to give Dulwich College Seoul a glimmer of hope with the flame-haired Frenchman finishing from close range after good work from Kris who grabbed the ball, stuck it under his arm like a baguette and raced back to the centre spot to the applause of the home bench. 2-4. Eight minutes to go, probably scant consolation at this late stage.\nUijeongbu were clearly rattled and with the winning line so close they were buckling badly, smashing the ball anywhere and everywhere in a desperate attempt to get what would have been their first win of the season. Dulwich College Seoul has one Year 8 student playing this year, highly unusual for a Varsity squad. However, such is the talent and promise of Belgian playmaker Edgar that he has been fast tracked to play with his older peers. Throughout the match he had shown composure and quality yet without finding the finishing touch. With the men in red camped on the edge of the Eagles box the ball broke kindly to Edgar who with a wave of his left wand sent the ball flying into the top right-hand corner. 3-4. Four minutes to go, game on!\nCometh the hour, cometh the man. With 2 minutes (plus a little added time...) left on the clock enter stage left Kaleb. With Dulwich College Seoul throwing everything bar the kitchen sink at the ICS-U goal a deflected shot from Eric fell to the Leopards central midfielder at the back post. Displaying calmness personified he drove the ball low into the far corner to tie this pulsating match at 4-4. Already deep in stoppage time surely there would not be time for a winner, or would there. Dulwich College Seoul could smell blood and nobody in a blue pinny wanted to be anywhere near the ball - all they wanted was to hear the sound of the final whistle. Straight from the restart possession was won back and it was Kaleb again who found the ball at his feet, this time centre stage just outside the Eagles box. He lifted his head, pulled back his right foot and struck through the ball. Time stood still as the ball sailed over the Uijeongbu goalie, just under the bar and the net billowed. 5-4. Cue a pitch invasion as elated fans flooded onto the pitch to celebrate with the shocked players. Uijeongbu only had time to touch the ball and the final whistle rang out to signal the end of one of the craziest finishes this writer has ever witnessed.\nThe ICS-U coach whose favourite catchphrases included \u2018spring the trap\u2019 and \u2018are you thirsty?\u2019 was far less excited than the home team and confronted the referees angrily at full-time. Perhaps instead of complaining about the amount of stoppage time played she should have launched an inquest into her team's capitulation. Anyway, it is safe to say that they will not be on her Easter card list any time soon.\nIn a week, which saw Tiger Woods end an 11-year wait to win his 15th Major title and Tottenham fight back from the brink to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League this stands to show the importance of maintaining a positive mentality - never give up and know that with hard work and a little luck, anything is possible.\nDulwich College Seoul can now look forward to facing top of the table CDS on Friday at Banpo. If it is even a fraction of the excitement served up this time out then you will not want to miss it!<|endoftext|>LAHORE, May 2 : Following their stellar performances in the first Test match against Zimbabwe in Harare, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) will offer central contracts in higher categories to cricketers Hassan Ali and Fawad Alam.\nTh report said veteran all-rounder Mohammad Hafeez will once again be offered a central contract after his last year\u2019s refusal to accept a contract C category award.<|endoftext|>Is for essay a of example personal college anybody listening.

        "passage": " Republic of Nigeria at the signing into law of the 2022 appropriation bill and the 2021 finance bill presidential villa, Abuja.\nI am delighted to sign into law today the 2022 Appropriation Bill as well as the enabling 2021 Finance Bill.\n2. I would like to thank the Senate President, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and indeed all the Distinguished and Honourable Leaders and Members of the National Assembly for the expeditious consideration and passage of these Bills.\n3. I also appreciate the continuing cooperation and commitment of the Ninth National Assembly to the restoration of a predictable January to December fiscal year, as provided for in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n4. The Finance Bill 2021 is particularly critical for the successful implementation of the 2022 Budget. Its passage further underscores our firm commitment to regularly support federal Appropriation Bills with Finance Bills designed to facilitate their implementation.\n5. I equally appreciate the continued mutual understanding, collaboration and productive engagements between officials of the Executive and the Legislative arms of government which have made this expeditious consideration as well as passage of the Bills possible.\n6. We must continue to sustain this partnership in the interest of our people in order to ensure the effective implementation of the budget and realization of its laudable objectives.\n7. As you will recall, I laid the 2022 Appropriation Bill before the Joint Session of the National Assembly on 7th October, 2021, and forwarded the 2021 Finance Bill thereafter. This Administration remains committed to the early presentation of the annual appropriation bill to the National Assembly to ensure its passage before the beginning of the fiscal year.\n8. As the 2023 Budget is going to be a transition budget, work will start in earnest to ensure early submission of the 2023-2025 Medium-Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper as well as the 2023 Appropriation Bill to the National Assembly.\n9. Heads of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) are to cooperate with the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning, more specifically with the Budget Office of the Federation, to realize this very important objective.\n10. The 2022 Budget that I just signed into law provides for aggregate expenditures of N17.127 trillion, an increase of N735.85 billion over the initial Executive Proposal for a total expenditure of N16.391 trillion. N186.53 billion of the increase however came from additional critical expenditures that I had authorized the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning to forward to the National Assembly. The Minister will provide the public the details of the budget as passed by the National Assembly, and signed into law by me.\n11. As I mentioned during the presentation of the 2022 Appropriation Bill, the fiscal year 2022 is very crucial in our efforts to complete and put to use critical agenda projects, as well as improve the general living conditions of our people.\n12. It is in this regard that I must express my reservations about many of the changes that the National Assembly has made to the 2022 Executive Budget proposal.\nReduction of N14.5 billion from several projects of the Ministry of Agriculture, and introducing over 1,500 new projects into the budgets of this Ministry and its agencies.\nInclusion of new provisions totaling N36.59 billion for National Assembly\u2019s projects in the Service Wide Vote which negates the principles of separation of Powers and financial autonomy of the Legislative arm of government.\nThe changes to the original Executive proposal are in the form of new insertions, outright removals, reductions and/or increases in the amounts allocated to projects.\nReduction in the provisions for many strategic capital projects to introduce \u2018Empowerment\u2019 projects. The cuts in the provisions for several of these projects by the National Assembly may render the projects unimplementable or set back their completion, especially some of this Administration\u2019s strategic capital projects.\nMost of the projects inserted relate to matters that are basically the responsibilities of State and Local Governments, and do not appear to have been properly conceptualized, designed and costed.\nMany more projects have been added to the budgets of some MDAs with no consideration for the institutional capacity to execute the additional projects and/or for the incremental recurrent expenditure that may be required.\n22. To achieve our revenue targets, revenue generating agencies, and indeed all MDAs must ensure prompt and full remittance of collected revenues. Relevant Agencies must also ensure the realization of our crude oil production and export targets. I also appeal to our fellow citizens and the business community at large to fulfill their tax obligations promptly.\n23. However, being a deficit budget, the specific Borrowing Plan will be forwarded to the National Assembly shortly. I count on the cooperation of the National Assembly for a quick consideration and approval of the Plan when submitted. All borrowings will be judiciously utilized and invested in our future growth and prosperity.<|endoftext|>There are several approaches to find regional https://www.topbrides.org females online.

Xarelto is also prescribed to lower the risk of stroke for people with atrial fibrillation, \u201can irregular (and often) rapid heart rate\u201d that causes poor blood circulation. One of the most dangerous side effects associated with Xarelto is a risk of bleeding. People who take the drug are likely to bruise more easily and it may take longer for bleeding to stop. Taking Xarelto with other medications such as aspirin may increase the risk even more.\nAccording to the lawsuit Xarelto\u2019s boxed warning did not adequately address the increased risk of bleeding especially when taken in light of the findings of a clinical trial sponsored by the drug\u2019s manufacturer that noted that in comparison to warfarin, a similar drug, \u201cpatients taking Xarelto have more gastrointestinal bleeds and need more transfusions.\u201d In addition the complaint, citing a report by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, asserts that the most \u201cadverse event\u201d related to using the drug was not the risk of bleeding but pulmonary embolism, a condition where a blood clot generally travels from the legs and causes a blockage in the arteries of the lungs. Ironically, this is a condition that Xarelto is intended to prevent.\nThe lawsuit also asserts that in spite of this knowledge, Jansen continues to market Xarelto without adequate warning. At present Xarelto does not include a FDA black box warning (the strongest warning required by the FDA) describing the irreversible bleeding related to using the drug, which effectively deprives doctors of critical information in prescribing the drug when could have deadly implications for consumers.\nAccording to the complaint, Jansen\u2019s failure to warn of the severity of the most dangerous side effects of using Xarelto resulted in the death of Emily Pigg, the mother of the plaintiff bringing the lawsuit. Ms. Pigg\u2019s physician prescribed the drug for atrial fibrillation and after using it \u201csuffered a hemorrhagic stroke and internal bleedings in November 2013 and in December 2013.\u201d The complaint further alleges that she was not able to recover and as a result she succumbed to her injuries in March 2014.\nIf you use or have used Xarelto and have suffered any of the serious side effects discussed here, you may be entitled to compensation for your injuries.

Some of us even grow to hate fizzy drinks (me).  But I'd say try a little bit on day 1, just a few gulps.  If you don't burp, stop there and try again on day 2, etc.  And that's also how Dr. Holsli worded it to me.\n\nReason I'm saying this is we don't know how to burp, what it feels like, how they come up and how they come out.  The only thing we do know and which comes 2nd nature is how to avoid the discomfort and how to avoid fizz.\n\nOn day 0 after Botox I didn't feel like burping at all.  Ate a big meal and didnt burp right after.  On day 1 still didn't feel like burping, then tried a little carbonated water and burped immediately.  Then a bit more and burped more.  I hate fizzy water by the way but I noticed that when not drinking fizzy water, I was not burping at all and when drinking it burping like crazy.  My RCPD symptoms did not get bad because of the burps.  Had I waited 2 weeks I may have only started burping at 2 weeks (hard to say), and thats 2 weeks less of experience before the critical 3-6 month mark when the Botox wears off.\n\nI've been burping nonstop since day 1 and I'm sure its because of the carbonation.  I burp after meals now, even without carbonation.\n\nAnd thats about all.  Good luck!<|endoftext|>The average price for Washington Nationals San Diego CA Tickets start from $78.

After The Presidential Blue House, guests will be led to Kyongbok Palace, which was built in 1394 as the main palace of the Joseon Dynasty. It is the most comprehensive and grandest of the five palaces for the Joseon Dynasty.\nAfter Gyeongbokgung Palace, we will visit the National Folk Museum, which portrays many activities of the Korean life style. These include religious rituals, housing, household tools, and social dynamics of traditional Korean life. The next stop is Jogye. The Jogye Order is the largest and most influential denomination in Korean Buddhism today.\nAfter Jogye Temple, we will head to the Ginseng Center or the Amethyst Factory. Ginseng is recognized all over the world as a cure-all, and processed products made of ginseng are sold in this center.\nAmethyst symbolizes peace, sincerity and health, and the amethyst produced in is recognized as among the highest quality in the world.\nJogyesa Temple is the center of Zen Buddhism in Korea, and is famous for being located in the city. From the busy streets of Jongno, follow the road towards Anguk Subway Station, and you will see Jogyesa Temple. The first thing you will notice at the temple are the lovely trees. These locust trees and baeksong trees in front of the Daeungjeon, the main temple building, are about 500 years old. One locust tree is about 26-meter high, and in the summer, provides a large amount of shade to enhance the mood of the temple. The baeksong tree is designated as a Natural Monument. The Daeungjeon building is a stately building built in 1938. The Dancheong is particularly beautiful with all the different colors painted on it, and inside the building is the Seokgamoni statue. In front of the Daeungjeon building, you can also see a 7-story stone pagoda containing Jinsinsari.\nUntil it was restored in 2005, Cheonggyecheon Stream existed only as a neglected watercourse hidden by an overpass. Today, it has been transformed into a haven of natural beauty amidst the bustle of city life.\nNarae Bridge, expressing a butterfly in flight, and Gwanggyo Bridge, symbolizing the harmony of the past and future, are just two of the more than twenty beautiful bridges that cross the stream. The \u2018Rhythmic Wall Stream\u2019, lined with fine marble, sculptures, and Korea\u2019s 8th stone building, Palseokdam, adorn the Cheonggyecheon Stream.\nCheonggyecheon Stream passes close to Deoksugung Palace, Seoul Plaza, the Sejong Center, Insa-dong Street, Changdeokgung Palace, and Changgyeonggung Palace, allowing visitors to easily visit major tourist sites after a leisurely stroll along the stream.\nGo and get a chance to see the place where the most important person in Korea lives!\nThe first thing that catches your eye when you arrive at Cheongwaaae are the blue tiles of the main building. The blue tiles and the smooth roof are in beautiful harmony with Mt. Bugaksan behind it. As the Blue House represents Korea, the blue tiles and the smooth curve of the roof represents the beauty of Korea.\nThe unique buildings Cheongwadae are comprised of the Main Office, Yeongbingwan (Guest House), Chunchugwan (Spring and Autumn Pavilion), Nokjiwon (Green grass), the Mugunghwa (Rose of Sharon) Valley, and the Seven Palaces. It is interesting to see that these buildings have special shapes. They are unique and beautifully designed, built in the Korean traditional style.\nGyeongbokgung is 5.4 million square feet and rectangular in shape. On the south side is the main gate Gwanghwamun. To the north, Sinmumun, east, Yeongchumun, and west, Geonchunmun. In the palace are the Jeongak buildings such as Geunjeongjeon, Gyotaejeon, Jagyeongjeon, Gyeonghoeru, and Hyangwonjeong. Geunjeongjeon, the main hall, was where inquiries and morning sessions were held. In the front courtyard, three granite walkways are present. The slightly more elevated middle walkway was for the King.\nThe National Folk Museum displays the lifestyle of ancient Koreans. There are 20,000 vestiges, with a total of 4000 folk relics. In the Center Hall there are traditional culture or folk related exhibits. The \u201cHall of Korean Lifestyle\u201d shows the lifestyles of Koreans from pre-historic times to the Joseon Period (1392~1910). You can compare the cultural characteristic and vestiges by period and you can see the development of pottery, agricultural implements and prints. The 2nd Exhibition called \u2018Hall of Koreans at Work\u2018 displays tools for farming, hunting, fishing, along with clothes and houses. It includes handicrafts, accessories, dishes, kimchi and jangdokdae. The 3rd Exhibition is called the \u2018Hall of a Korean Life Cycle\u2018 and presents the life of an ancient Korean from birth to marriage to death. Outside the museum is more interesting than inside. The Jejudo Island sculptures such as Dolharubang, windmills, treadmills and sheds are displayed outdoors. The National Folk Museum holds a \u2018Korean Folk Concert\u2019 every Saturday at the auditorium. The National Folk Museum designates the first Sunday every month as \u2018Visit the Museum\u2019 Day in admission fee is waived.<|endoftext|>My mother tried to wait until my brother and I were grown to leave.

        "passage": " to get to the main hiking path.\nInwangsan is a mountain not only known for its beauty, but also for its magnificently dressed shamanic inhabitants. Korean shamans, or mudang, are usually women and are seen as the intermediaries between humans and the heavenly gods and nature spirits.\nThey are easy to spot on the mountain, as they are often chanting or dancing to the cacophonous tunes of traditional instruments, performing gut. These services are held to bring luck, cure illnesses or exorcise evil spirits, and the place you\u2019re most likely to experience one of these ceremonies is at Guksadang Shrine, not far from the complex entrance. The shrine is said to be the country\u2019s most important shamanist structure, as it is believed to house the spirit of King Taejo, founder of the Joseon Dynasty.\nThe otherworldliness of the chanting is only enhanced by the mountain\u2019s eerie rock formations. Seonbawi, or \u201cZen Rocks,\u201d take the appearance of meditating robed monks and are a popular spot for women praying to have children, as they are associated with fertility. Still other boulders further up along the path resemble skulls and bats.\nDespite these rather creepy associations, the mountain offers phenomenal views of downtown Seoul, while the peace and quiet, which is only occasionally interrupted by the ring of a gong or beats of a drum, is refreshing.\nFrom this point, you can turn around and head back to the station or continue along the Seoul Fortress Wall for more fresh air and city views. Just be sure that you wear decent walking shoes and bring along plenty of water, as the trek can get steep and uneven in some parts. Follow the signs labeled \u201cChanguimun Gate\u201d to get to Buam-dong, where mountainside cafes and quaint galleries await.\nTo Get There: Take the Seoul subway to Dongnimmun Station (Line 3, Exit 3).\nThis is a gorgeous place, and I won't soon forget it. Attended an event here sponsored by the company. The reception hour was held in one of the rooms next to the venues in NYC.

        "passage": " incapacitate Korea within minutes without using any conventional weapon. Even if the aim is not an invasion per se (nor even a diversion preceding an invasion of say North Korea), this would definitely damage the reputation of Korea as an economic powerhouse.\nWith its drive, infrastructures and talents, Korea should be ahead of Israel in national security. KISA (Korea Information Security Agency) significantly improved its visibility, but the national culture remains focused on hardware.\nSamsung has eventually understood it needed to evolve and change business models, but it took series of obvious wake up calls (ie Google wolfing down Motorola). The government will probably follow suit. And if spurs are needed, the potential candidacy of Ahn Cheol-soo at the 2012 presidential elections might help : the founder of antivirus specialist AhnLab has some credentials in the area.\nIf the recently inaugurated D-Cube City has quickly gained a solid reputation among local food lovers, it is well deserved.\nThough less spectacular than Seoul Times Square (in nearby Yeongdeungpo-gu) architecturally speaking, the complex devoted more space for the comfort of its visitors, and developed a really original and consistent concept in the food department, with a clear editorial line around three major \"verticals\" : a trip back to 1920s Shanghai at \"China Feng\", a \"World Street Food\" with mouthwatering menus for Japanese food fans, and an already cult \"Korean Food Street\".\nAll three are located in the department store section (respectively 6F, B1, and B2), which also includes more classic restaurants and chains, and even a cute Pororo Theme Park. Beyond the dept store / mall : the D-Cube Arts Center, a D-Cube Park, the Sheraton Seoul D-Cube City (I took this view over Shindorim station and Guro-gu from their lobby - spectacular panorama on 41F), an outdoor park, offices and apartments... a major and ambitious project, but not a completely disruptive business model.\nNow the food is really something you can't find elsewhere... The originality lies in the fact that it's really the original stuff. Cooks and dishes have been carefully sourced across the country and beyond. For instance, Michelin-starred Mist, the noodle expert, came from Tokyo. And even for such trivial stuff as ddeokbokki, the Chosen One is no other than Mimime : Hongdae's institution even closed shop there to open here - nothing changed regarding the queue, except that you don't have to wait outdoors anymore, and that you can do many other things while waiting for your food.\nBut the jewel of the crown is the Korean Street Food / Korean Food Street : a whole village full of life and terrific food. If the National Folk Museum of Korea were to propose a live show of Korean specialities, that would be it. The full course at Byeokgyesu costs only KRW 11,000 for lunch, and KRW 17,000 for dinner. It may look classic from a distance, but every single banchan has a unique story to tell and an incredible taste to reveal.\nIt's huge and seats hundreds, but very pleasant - you don't feel in some big food factory, rather in a festive village gathering. Everybody is smiling, simply enjoying the moment, sharing the experience.\nI found the business card I thought I'd lost, so I could detail the names of the different parts of the Korean Food Street, in particular the full course restaurant (\ubcbd\uacc4\uc218).\nFor the first time, I tasted some Korean food that I really disliked. I was warned before, but gave it a shot nonetheless.\nFermented skate (\ud64d\uc5b4) has a tough reputation, but each bite is supposed to pass more peacefully with a bit of pork, gimchi, and gochujang, wrapped in the traditional lettuce leaf.\nEver the tastebud daredevil, I tried it bare to enjoy its flavor to the fullest (foulest?).\nI simply can't describe the experience, and as I try to recall it, I can see my fingers trembling over the keyboard - an early sign of severe PTSD if I ever saw one.\nNothing weird about the look or the texture, but the smell could come from an over-expired if not maggot-infested camembert cheese, and as the thing explodes into your mouth, you almost wish you had ordered rotten skunk sashimi instead. The pungent aftertaste wouldn't be silenced by three coffees, and I bet even beondegi toothpaste wouldn't have succeeded.\nA perfect near-death experience before visiting Yongmiri Cemetery, as peaceful as ever (see above picture - that's in Yongmi-ri, Gwangtan-myeon, Paju).\nPS: fellow Korean food lovers, pass this dish and go straight to the nearest Korean restaurant to enjoy this overwhelmingly fantastic cuisine.\nStrange feeling, yesterday, as I roamed the inaugural exhibitions at the brand new old Seoul Station (\"Countdown\" and YIPPA 2011 - see \"Culture Station Seoul 284\").\nTo start with, the light was special, and with that Latino group performing in a distance it almost felt like a summer evening in Spain before a storm. But the air was dry, and the rain wasn't announced before Friday. Yet every color was enhanced, every person on the street an actor on stage. Brighter than ever, the orange of Seoul Square. Saddening as always, the scattered army of the homeless guarding the old Seoul Station.\nEven from a closer range, it's hard to believe this landmark has been completely renovated. And as you enter, you realize how small it was : a provincial station at most, and except for the two of us, only a handful of people inside, including the staff.\nWe started with the Yonhap photo expo, which certainly didn't lift our moods : UN Millennium Development Goals are about tackling every dimensions of human misery, and in \"Share the Moment, Share the Future\", photographers from all horizons are precisely pointing their fingers where it hurts. Tough images, utter despair, with just the occasional glimmer of hope...\nWe then moved to \"countdown\", which doesn't exactly lifts art to new levels, but provided the perfect alibi for a visit to ole Seoul Yeok. Restoration it is, and in its most basic form : each room recovers its initial aspect, and sans furniture ni human traffic, the old train station has the green, gloomy atmosphere of an abandoned hospital. Even the \"VIP rooms\" feel like the Kubrick's version of King's Overlook hotel. But guess what, that's exactly what I expected and hoped for : unpretentious, not overdone, and respectful of an original architecture that includes charming staircases and cute alcoves as much as dull corridors.\nImperfections are welcome, even if the green wooden windows didn't have to be that respectful of the old days : as you can see on this picture (sorry for the quality, I'm all thumbs with picturephones), they are not weatherproof.\nThe second floor offers a much brighter face with its 240 degree view on Hangangno, Namdaemun, the Toegyero overpass, Dongja-dong, Galwon-dong, and (for how long?) Inwangsan and Huam-dong. The former barber shop has been converted into a permanent exhibition about the restoration : judging by the initial state of the building, they had to do more than just scratch the surface of the walls, but considering Korean construction standards in 1925, the Japanese did a pretty decent job in the first place.\nThis is only the beginning for the \"New Old Seoul Station\" - again, a more official inauguration is scheduled for March 2011 -, but as expected, it is already a very promising venue for cultural events, and a key asset in a middle of a neighborhood about to experience major redevelopments.\nNB: I wasn't allowed to take a full picture of the main hall because of the works on display. The first photo above, a partial one, was taken from an angle that reminded me of Orsay Museum. I don't remember the stained glass on the ceiling but then again, I was not a frequent user of the old station.\nWhat a cultural year for France in Korea! We've seen French musea send key works to Seoul and Daejeon (respectively Musee d'Orsay and Musee d'Art Moderne de Saint-Etienne*), the nation return Oegyujanggak books to their homeland**, and now our top private collector display some of his goods to the Korean public.\nFrancois Pinault is quite a figure in France, and his rivalry with fellow billionaire Bernard Arnault considerably added to the legend. Both are tough predators and acute businessmen who transformed their fathers companies into global conglomerates, and they've often been fighting on the same turf, starting on the internet with Kertel and Libertysurf, before the masstige carnage between PPR-Gucci and LVMH. But they are diametrically different characters : while the short and rough Pinault claims his earthy roots, cultivates a powerful network of fellow Bretons, and often attends the games of his Rennes Football Club (\"his\" at the affectionate as well as financial levels), the tall, polished, and distant Arnault positions himself in quasi-royalry circles and points out the piano as its main hobby.\nTheir rivalry has shifted into the art arena. And if Arnault had more opportunities in his youth, Pinault started his collection much earlier, gaining a strong reputation in contemporary art circles"

These designations occur based on recommendations made through the Hangang ecosystem and forest ecosystem surveys, etc. conducted by the SMG, and the recommendations of environmental organizations and related professional agencies. The designation process also includes consultations and advice from experts. Thirty-five species of swallows, toads, roe deer, and other wildlife were the first to be designated and an announcement was made on November 15th, 2000. On October 25th, 2007, 14 species of wild animals and plants including squirrels and onychodactylus fisheri were added.\nEveryone wants to live in a pleasant environment with clean air, clean water, warm sunlight and green spaces. The metropolitan city of Seoul has over 10 million people and continues to grow, but the quality of life for its residents has not been enhanced significantly. More than 76% of the parks & landscape of Seoul is forest area concentrated on the outskirts. Thus, the space available for leisure and relaxation during daily life is insufficient, particularly in the city\u2019s CBD.\nTo address this lack of green and park spaces, Children\u2019s Grand Park was created in 1973, Seoul Grand Park in 1984, Hangang Park in 1986, Yeouido Park in 1999, World Cup Park in 2002, Seoul Forest in 2005, Dream and Forest Park in northern Seoul in 2009. At the same time, the city government created small parks in neighborhoods and working spaces through the Wall Removal Project in 1996, the Roof Garden Project in 2000 and the School Park Project in 2006. As a result, parks make up a total of 170 km\u00b2, or 28% of the metropolitan area. By type, 38.56% of this area is urban nature parks, 23.21% is natural parks, 25.45% is neighborhood parks, 1.29% is children\u2019s parks and 1.40% reserved for cemetery parks.\nSeoul\u2019s water management is divided into public sewage treatment, water quality monitoring of the Hangang and its tributaries, underground water management, rainwater management and management of wastewater discharging sources. Public sewage treatment started in 1978 when the Jungnang Sewage Treatment Plant began operations. Tancheon Sewage Treatment Plant was constructed in 1987, and Nanji and Seonam sewage treatment plants in 1994. Their performance has gradually improved so that they have discharged treated sewage water with BOD lower than 20 \u338e/L since 1993. As the management of effluent water quality has tightened since 2000, the BOD level of treated sewage of the Jungnang Sewage Treatment Plant is maintained at less than 10 \u338e/L. Water quality monitoring for the Hangang and its tributaries began in the early 1980s.\nAt that time, however, this was only through occasional surveys. Regular water quality monitoring at specific locations and for specific items began in the 1990s. Underground water management also began in the 1990s. In the 2000s, rainwater management (related ordinance enacted in 2005) and a water utilization promotion project (related ordinance enacted in 2011) began. Management of wastewater discharging sources began when the Environmental Pollution Prevention Act was legislated in 1963 and gradually strengthened, with the Environment Conservation Act in 1977 and the Water Quality Conservation Act in 1990 enacted. Because of the increasing unauthorized, illegal and opportunistic discharges of wastewater during the night, holidays and the rainy season, monitoring of wastewater discharging facilities is frequent.\nAs the contamination of public waters caused by sewage emerged as a problem, Seoul constructed the Cheonggyecheon (stream) Sewage Treatment Plant in 1976, the first in the nation and able to handle 150,000 tons of sewage per day. The Jungnang Sewage Treatment Plant was built in 1979 and could handle 210,000 tons/day. The Seonam, Nanji and Tancheon (stream) sewage treatment plants followed. To secure the financial resources needed for sewage treatment, Seoul began imposing a sewage fee in 1984 on the basis of the \u201cpolluter pays\u201d principle.\nSeoul began expanding the 4 plants in 1992 to cope with the increasing amount of sewage as the city\u2019s overall conditions changed. With the targeted capacity of an extra 2.7 million tons per day realized in 1998, total facility capacity reached 5.81 million tons per day. As regulations on effluent water from these plants have steadily tightened, Seoul has upgraded the facilities accordingly. However, the cost of constructing advanced disposal plants is enormous, so the city gives priority to increasing the capacity of existing plants first, and adds advanced facilities later if the expanded capacity is insufficient. Seoul completed phase 1 of a project to introduce advanced disposal facilities to the Jungnang Sewage Treatment Plant to bring its capacity to 460,000 tons per day in 2007, and constructed additional facilities to supplement capacity at the Tancheon, Seonam and Nanji sewage treatment plants.\nThe network of sewage pipes, leading from discharging sources to the sewage treatment plants, had reached a length of 10,487 km as of the end of December 2012. From its designation as the nation\u2019s capital 600 years ago until the modern era, Seoul\u2019s sewer system was constructed and expanded with a focus on management of rainwater. At times, sewage leaked out of broken pipes or joints to contaminate underground water, soil and streams. In the meantime, large amounts of underground water flowed into the pipes so that the treatment plants sometimes processed relatively clean water, thereby lowering their operational efficiency. To cope with such situations, Seoul began in 1992 to install certain kinds of endoscopy cameras (CCTV) inside the sewage pipes to monitor for problems, using the information in maintenance and repair of the pipes.\nIn 1962, when urban development began in earnest in Seoul, rainwater began to flow into the waterways as impervious areas, where rainwater could not penetrate the ground, expanded. Thus, areas along the rivers and streams and low-lying ground were habitually flooded during localized torrential downpours. Paving the bottoms and sides of the waterways with concrete could serve to keep the water flow quick enough to prevent flooding, but this decreased the underground water and depleted the springs. Accordingly, it became difficult to ensure sufficient water resources during the dry season, with the dry river and stream beds resulting in the frequent occurrence of heat islands.\nThe SMG began rainwater management projects in the 2000s to address these problems. Systems were begun by enacting ordinances on water management in 2005 and on facilitation and support for the reuse of water in 2011, establishment of a basic plan for water management in 2013, and projects to collect and use rainwater since then. As of 2012, there were 141 locations for rainfall storage and permeation including Mt. Mangwusan Rainfall Storage and Gangil District Rainfall Storage, totaling a capacity of 339,662 \u33a5. There are 490 locations with rainwater recycling facilities including the new Seoul City Hall office building, the Dongdaemun Design Plaza, Gangnam Segokrien Park, etc. totaling a capacity of 107,671\u33a5. The SMG provided financial support for installation of 125 of these facilities (capacity: 2,020 \u33a5). It also recommends the installation of rainwater permeation and recycling facilities for projects subject to environmental impact assessments, and making such installation mandatory for large-scale housing development projects.\nWater supply management can be largely divided into tap water production, maintenance of distribution pipelines, and management of tap water quality. A water supply system was introduced to Seoul in 1908, during the late Joseon period, by an American technician named Henry Collbran, the 100th anniversary of which Seoul celebrated in 2008. In 1949, the Water Supply and Waterworks Installation Act of Seoul was passed. Since construction of Guui Water Purification Plant in 1974, a total of 6 plants (Gwangam, Amsa, Yeongdeungpo, Ttukdo and Gangbuk being the other five) have been built and are in operation. The membrane filtration process was introduced in 2011 to make the water cleaner tasting. Major maintenance of the water distribution pipeline began in 1984, replacing 13,122 km of the total 13,668 km of deteriorated pipelines by 2012. Thanks to this replacement, the tap water flow rate in the city improved remarkably between 2000 and 2012, from 72% to 94.5%. The quality of tap water is maintained through management of water supply sources, expansion of the items for inspection (from 28 in 1990 to 163 in 2012), and quality checks of household tap water, etc.\nThe first water supply system in the city was the water purification plant constructed at Ttukdo Reservoir, which was completed on September 1st, 1908 by Collbran and another American, Harry Bostwick, who were authorized by Emperor Gojong to work on the water supply system project. Production capacity was 12,500 tons per day, which supplied 125,000 people with water. Three purification plants were operating in 1946 (Ttukdo, Noryangjin and Guui, with a total capacity of 150,000 m\u00b3 per day) and five in"

The wall is 18.6 kilometers long and connects four mountains: Inwangsan, Baegaksan/Bugaksan, Naksan, and Namsan. Seoul Fortress Wall was initially built in 1396 and it took 98 days. During the Japanese occupation, the majority of fortress wall was destroyed and some of the parts were recently (2014) rebuilt. Seoul Government is still working on completely reconstructing the wall and its gates.\nEven though Seoul Fortress Wall is basically located in downtown of Seoul, you won\u2019t be able to spot the wall very easily as most of the parts in the main streets aren\u2019t reconstructed. However, you will notice huge ancient gates standing in the middle of busy roads \u2013 they are part of the wall. The most visible parts of fortress wall are in the mountains.\nThis short trail runs across the mountain Bugaksan (342 m) which is one of the inner mountains of old Seoul and is the highest one. Until 2007 access to the mountain was closed to the public as the reason of North Korean Special Forces infiltration in Seoul in 1968. Even though now it\u2019s open for public, there are some restrictions regarding the trail such as it\u2019s closed on Mondays, opened at 9:00 to 16:00, and every visitor have to fill the visiting form and have an ID in order to hike a mountain. Also, you need to finish hike by a certain time and you have to take in mind that during a hike you will be watched by tons of army guys and won\u2019t be allowed to take photos in certain spots.\nThis trail is a very short trail that can be combined with other Seoul Fortress Wall trails if you wish to do more walking. The trail leads via Naksan Mountain (124 m) and the mural village of Ihwa-dong. You will be able to see bohemian neighborhood filled with impressive views of Seoul. This trail is very famous for watching sunset and sunrise.

The wall is 18.6 kilometers long and connects four mountains: Inwangsan, Baegaksan/Bugaksan, Naksan, and Namsan. Seoul Fortress Wall was initially built in 1396 and it took 98 days. During the Japanese occupation, the majority of fortress wall was destroyed and some of the parts were recently (2014) rebuilt. Seoul Government is still working on completely reconstructing the wall and its gates.\nEven though Seoul Fortress Wall is basically located in downtown of Seoul, you won\u2019t be able to spot the wall very easily as most of the parts in the main streets aren\u2019t reconstructed. However, you will notice huge ancient gates standing in the middle of busy roads \u2013 they are part of the wall. The most visible parts of fortress wall are in the mountains.\nThis short trail runs across the mountain Bugaksan (342 m) which is one of the inner mountains of old Seoul and is the highest one. Until 2007 access to the mountain was closed to the public as the reason of North Korean Special Forces infiltration in Seoul in 1968. Even though now it\u2019s open for public, there are some restrictions regarding the trail such as it\u2019s closed on Mondays, opened at 9:00 to 16:00, and every visitor have to fill the visiting form and have an ID in order to hike a mountain. Also, you need to finish hike by a certain time and you have to take in mind that during a hike you will be watched by tons of army guys and won\u2019t be allowed to take photos in certain spots.\nThis trail is a very short trail that can be combined with other Seoul Fortress Wall trails if you wish to do more walking. The trail leads via Naksan Mountain (124 m) and the mural village of Ihwa-dong. You will be able to see bohemian neighborhood filled with impressive views of Seoul. This trail is very famous for watching sunset and sunrise.

The courtyard was simply amazing and is a must see for anyone seriously interested in seeing a wonderfully preserved hanok. Many members of the tour did not know about the house before attending the tour.\nPictures from this tour can be found on the RAS-KB Facebook page. Also, Dr. Fouser has recently started a blog about tours he has led. His blog can be found here.\nI hope you spent a happy Chuseok weekend? I was very glad to hear that nearly 40 of you attended Bob Fouser's guided walk through his beloved Seochon on Saturday. Next weekend's excursion to Andong has also proved to be very popular. Spending a night in a'real' Korean house in rural Hahoe Village is in itself a special experience, and the entire program promises to be most rewarding. A large number attended the September lectures by Robert Provine and Kathryn Weathersby, it is a great encouragement to feel that you enjoy the lectures we provide.\nIn Korea there is a tradition that says the autumn is the best time for reading books. As you know, the RASKB has a considerable number of books for sale and we will soon be announcing a special autumn book sale to encourage you to build up a library of books about Korea.\nWe have begun work to redecorate and redesign our office, hoping that it will become a place you will enjoy visiting.\nPlease feel free to write to us with suggestions for our next year's activities, we hope to offer excursions to Japan, Mongolia and North-eastern China (including Baedu-san), and sometimes we will try to use trains to get away from Seoul for some of our trips in order to avoid the Saturday-morning gridlock.\nI look forward to greeting many of you at one or other of the events listed below. The autumn is Korea's most beautiful season, I hope you will enjoy it to the full with us.\nSister Miriam Cousins.\nSister Miriam will survey the situation regarding HIV/AIDS in Korea, both among Korean people and among foreigners.

This is the top season for Seorak-san viewing and we need to know very soon if you are interested as hotel rooms will soon be unobtainable. See here for more information.\nOn Sunday, October 21, 2012 - 9:00am to 12:00pm, Ms. Won-Na Cha is offering a repeat of her much-appreciated Fortress Wall of Bugaksan Hike, a short hike inside Seoul, using public transport, for those with little time. See here for more information.\nOn Saturday, November 3 -- Sunday, November 4, David Mason will lead an excursion to Jiri-san and Namwon, in the south-west. Jiri Mountain is a majestic massif and the autumn foliage reaches its peak there later than in Seorak-san. David is famed for his deep knowledge of sacred mountains, of which Jiri-san is chief, and of temples which abound there. See here for more information.\nA professor of Korean dance, (Ms.) Park Eun-young (who has spent most of her outstanding career researching classical court dance) is going to present a remarkable authentic reinactment of court ceremony, complete with dance. The exciting thing about this event is that it will not be held in a theatre, but rather in the exact location within the palace where it was originally performed.\nProfessor Park would especially like as many interested foreigners as possible to come to the performance. Seating is very limited-- only approximately 200 seats will be available within the palace courtyard and all other members of the audience will have to stand.\nThis performance is a court ceremony originally held in February 1829 at Changkyeonggung Palace. It was performed in honor of King Sunjo\u2019s 40th birthday and to mark the 30th anniversary of his accession to the throne. The dance was created by his son, Crown Prince Hyomyeong (1809-1830).\nOn October 3, not only will the dance be performed but also the rituals, music and actual site of the original dance will be used in an \u201cEvening of Decorum\u201d in honor of Foundation Day.\nplease send an email to Suzanna Samstag at |||EMAIL_ADDRESS||| as soon as possible.\nboth of them among our most famous for the quality of their content.

The Joseon period walls are unique in having been designed and built in just a few years in the 1790s under the leadership of one man, Dasan (Jeong Yan-Yong), one of Korea's greatest scholars. They protect a palace built to house the king on visits to his father's grave, but this was no ordinary father and no ordinary king, the story of Prince Sado's death in a rice-chest on the order of the previous king his father haunts the imagination.

Largely untouched by the Korean War, Gangneung contains a considerable number of outstanding buildings from the Joseon era, including the complex of buildings known as Seongyo-jang, a complete aristocratic residence where the original family still resides, and where we will spend the night in (luxurious) Joseon style! Along the shores of Gyeong-po Lake there are several beautiful pavilions designed for relaxed enjoyment of the view over the water, where generations of scholars composed poems while drinking wine and listening to music. We might try to imitate them. For full information see here. Pictures from a previous RASKB trip to Gangneung and the East Sea can be found here.\nOn Saturday, September 29, 2012: 1:30-4:30. Prof. Fouser will lead a group through Seochon, the very special area to the West of Gyeongbok-gung, a truly human neighborhood where many simple people live, run shops, and where the residents are trying to maintain humane values against the pressures of consumerism. For more information, click here.\nOn Saturday, October 6, 2012: 13:00-16:30. he will walk us through Daehangno and Hyehwa-dong, viewing the buildings surviving from older days and evoking the past in this very vibrant area which once housed Seoul National University. Click here for more information.\nFinally, on Saturday, October 27, 2012: 13:30-18:00 Dr. Fouser will take us on a stroll through Old Incheon: \"A Walk through Korean History since 1876.\" Chemulpo was the old name for Incheon and it was the port through which many of the early missionaries, diplomats and merchants came to Korea. As we walk through the streets, we will view the many surviving buildings built by the American and British missionaries and businessmen, as well as the Japanese traders and bankers, and we will end our walk among the buildings of the Chinese neighborhood, where many restaurants invite us to linger. Additional information about the tour to Incheon can be found here. Pictures from our last trip to Incheon can be found here.\nOur next overnight excursion will take place on Saturday, October 6, 2012 to Sunday, October 7, 2012. It will take us to Andong and we will spend the night in traditional Korean family homes in Hahoe Village. There we will view the evening's traditional firework and fire festival at the riverside. This is the 15th Annual Andong International Mask Dance Festival and we hope that on Sunday it will be possible to view the extremely exciting cheonnyeonnori, a game where two opposing groups clash, chant, and throw their shoes around, as well as performances by local shamans etc. Full details are here.\nI am writing now because we need to have some idea of the number of rooms we should reserve.

        "passage": " Residence (standard but compact hotel room), both recommendable and right in the heart of it. But there are tons of choices.\nFirst of a beautiful morning for me, after walking up from the bus stop on the highway. I'd been prepared for a long wait for that bus at Gupabal Station (the internet had warnings), but it arrived the very same moment I did, and we took off immediately. I even got to sit. (For contrast, at the end of the day I caught the same bus just a bit farther north, and it was Indian-train packed; I barely squeezed in. Had I come back down to the same spot with all the other hikers, I'd have been left standing at the curb. Now what?\nThe highly-recommendable JSA tours are unfortunately off for the foreseeable future, something to do with a swine flu outbreak, and they can't go rounding up wildlife in minefields. Tours called \"DMZ\", all that's on offer just now, only go to the edge of the DMZ and peer in, a distant second choice. Maybe not worth the bother.\nI'm excited for you. Already I'm aching to go back a third time.\nThanks a lot again I'll see what's possible with Bukhansan in due time. Cats on the summit though? Wow, I love cats!\nIt's still so far in the future, and I'll have to see what CV does until then anyway. But yes, I'm super excited. So odd: I was looking forward to Tokyo, but wasn't quite so excited. I also didn't have so many ideas on what to do. I've never considered going to Korea before for some reason. It just wasn't on my radar.\nReceived an email this morning from Azerbaijan government stating that my E-Visa has been \"annulled\".\nOur prime minister yesterday has announced a Do Not Travel advice to all Australians, which to me means international travel as we are an island.\nMy round Australia cruise was cut short and we are now back home. We were supposed to go right round Australia for 28 nights, but we went Sydney - Melbourne - Burnie (where we were told the bad news) - Hobart and back to Sydney. So, I didn't get the two missing Australian states (WA & SA) and I didn't get to PNG.\nThe good news is that we get a very generous compensation package which will go some way to bringing my fantasy of a 2023 full world cruise into reality.\nSorry to hear that. I got my cruise over just in time. Australia and PNG. We got to land at all ports except Rabaul, where we weren't allowed ashore. We landed in three other PNG ports though.\nI got lucky with my cruise/tour of New Zealand in February. New Zealand has hunkered down and Oz has now followed suit, even our island state of Tasmania has cut itself off from the mainland. Anyone going there MUST self isolate for two weeks or face the law.\nGill & Tony, you can look forward to rebooking when all gets back to normal, whatever that normal will be. I've done 1.5 circumnavigations and I've run out of Oz cruise destinations.\nGood luck y'all up north. From what we're seeing in our media methinks you have a rough road ahead. Washy, washy, washy.\noh come on! I would have changed the name of this thread if I could, but let everyone play as they like. Some \u2018brag\u2019 about climbing caches or doing 24h powertrail caching, others combine their hobby of travelling with caching. Why not.\nI've been participating in this thread since it was created and have read all 39 pages of posts. I've never thought of any posts here as bragging even though I'm envious of those that are able to travel more frequently than I (especially those that live in Europe).\nYes, I know You're one of the regulars here.\nBelgium today closed it's borders. Police is stopping people driving to the coast even if they have a second home there.\nNo non-essential movements. No new countries for a while.\nSeoul has great caching. Hopefully things with the virus clear up and borders start opening up again. Before you come, if you want to send me a message I can give you recommendations on some of the best caches in the area.\nNamsan in the center of the city and following the path of the three virtuals is what most tourists do. I've set up the first Adventure Lab in the city in a nice historic district too. There's so much in Seoul to enjoy. Seven years in and I'm still finding new and amazing places.\nAgreed, Insadong has a great cache too with all the touristy stuff anyone would want. Most of the area is off limits to cars, not sure why anyone would want to drive through there anyway.\nI know you hiked Gwanaksan too, did you see the cats there? Actually, cats are on most mountains in Korea. I always found that interesting too.\nNext time you come back let one of the locals know and we can try showing you some more remote mountains or regions in the country.\nthanks a lot s. Korea seems to be on the right path at the moment, but Europe is nowhere near that.\n@on4bam I don\u2019t understand that the Dutch authorities have such issues restricting movement like other countries. Yes, it\u2019s not good for the economy, but it even took a while until they said that keeping a distance is good.\nOn a different note, we now see the advantage of (almost) never caching close to home, lots to find on foot and by bike as \"non essential\" travel is forbidden but walking/biking and other \"exercise\" is encouraged.\nI have been checking out that myself locally. I have found most near me, but if I limited myself to a walk or cycle to one a day, I might be able to manage a cache a day for a couple of weeks. And get exercise.\nI\u2019ve not cached much in my immediate area, and there\u2019s a fair bit of varied (for Dutch) nature around, 2km max get cycling out of town. That\u2019s not too bad if I get desperate.\nThis is a 5Km radius (almost) centered om my location. On Wednesday we biked to the area on the right edge (40Km tour) and last Sunday we walked the area just outside the circle along the river (16Km).\nHere is a 5km one where I live. As can be seen I have been busy, but there are still a few caches to find. \nThis is my 5km circle, excluding my own caches.\nThere used to be a lot more in the built-up areas but one by one they disappeared. Some good memories from my early days of caching.\nWell... this is just inside of town. Lots to do?\ni just came back from a 20km hilly forest hike with a 21 stage multi and 4 other caches. Might have been a new community as well.\nI was watching Al Jazeera news this morning and they were reporting that Qatar has closed its borders. I was due to fly (in two weeks) to Azerbaijan via Doha, Qatar, on a Qatar Airways flight. The planets definitely weren't lining up.\nYes, on various mountains including Gwanaksan. (Hard to believe I've been up that one three times!) I followed one cat into its bunker (as I'm sure you know, Korean mountains have pillboxes in good repair) and found a dish each of water and cat food. Ah good, I figured people were looking after them.\nThank you! Invitation tucked away somewhere safe. Hmm, I wonder if it'll be safe to travel, say November? Great month to be in Korea. Already I have some geo-friends interested in joining me, whenever it might happen.\nMy trip is also booked for end of October/ early November. I can fortunately change or cancel the flight if needed. Lets see what happens until then, right?\nI have one small trip coming up this week, to Helgoland in Germany. Not a new country, but at least a new federal country and up to three new counties. And up to 11 EarthCaches and the chance to see some lovely red sandstone.\nNice! One of the advantages of living in Europe.\nHere in Australia it's a bit harder to get to other countries since there aren't any you can just drive to. It's pretty much flights to get anywhere, or get on a cruise. Unless you buy your own boat, but I don't think I can justify spending that kind of money for Geocaching.\nI totally get you! I'd not want to live in a huge country where you have to fly to get anywhere. I looked at this from various angles, and figured I can do this trip despite covid. I'd not want to get on a plane at the moment though.<|endoftext|>Strengths Easy to use, and capable in all turn-shapes.

In early trading, BYD stock fell 2% to $39.20.\nIn the first half of 2022, BYD sold 641,000 EVs, representing a year-over-year surge of more than 300%. In June, BYD sold more than three times the number of EVs it unloaded during the same month in 2021.\nMeanwhile, Tesla delivered nearly 565,000 EVs during the same period. And in the second quarter of this year, Elon Musk\u2019s automaker unloaded 254,695 EVs, down meaningfully from the 310,048 EVs that it delivered in Q1.\nTesla noted that in Q2, it had had to contend with \u201congoing supply chain challenges and factory shutdowns beyond [its] control.\u201d On a positive note, however, the American automaker reported it had produced more EVs in June than in any previous month in its history.\nBYD, whose headquarters is in Shenzhen China, had roughly 288,000 employees in 2021, versus just about 224,000 in 2020. The company specializes in making plug-in hybrid vehicles and EV batteries. Plug-in hybrid vehicles have both EV batteries and gas engines.

Can you tell us how long you have been at the center and some more about your department?\nRizzo: I\u2019ve been here at the center for 12 years and originally, we were exclusively crystal meth recovery services. And as that grew, we decided that we would expand, and crystal meth recovery services were no longer appropriate because we were doing other substances as well. It\u2019s kind of a sub department.\nIn your time here, what have you noticed as far as the rates of crystal meth use in WeHo or by your clients?\nSo, 40 percent of our clients in mental health have a substance abuse diagnosis.

It never went away.\u2019 I think part of the problem; well, drugs can be cyclical if you think about it. In the 60s it was pot, LSD, and in the 70s, we continued with that.

Earlier Canada had gifted Germany victory as the final round two fixtures played out at the Betway World Cup of Pool at the Mountbatten Centre in Portsmouth.\nBefore the tournament Karl Boyes said he would love the chance to \u2018shut Earl Strickland up\u2019, after the pair had a fiery Mosconi Cup singles match in Las Vegas last year. Boyes and his team-mate Darren Appleton booked their match against USA with a confident 7-1 victory over Greece.\nNikos Ekonomopoulos and Alexander Kazakis were sloppy early on but as England A gained momentum the only further chance Greece were allowed came in the sixth rack when Appleton scratched. They took the chance to make the score 5-1 but Kazakis\u2019 subsequent illegal break handed control back to England A, who pounced to reach the hill and then take the match in the following rack.\n\u201cWe are looking forward to the match with USA now,\u201d said Appleton. \u201cIt was in the back of our minds but we weren\u2019t going to look past Greece because they are a great team.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t play at their best tonight and we were solid. We broke better tonight and just need to get a better feel of the table now.\nBoyes added: \u201cThey had a couple of chances at the start of the match but the table caught them out. Darren has adapted brilliantly and played two good matches, he was flawless tonight.\nAs host nation England are entitled to two teams in the tournament but England B were relegated to near-spectators in their clash with China.\nWang Can and Dang Jinhu were clinical and Chris Melling and Daryl Peach were left frustrated in the wings as their opponents didn\u2019t miss a shot, running out 7-0 winners to earn a quarter-final with Austria.\n\u201cWe played very well tonight and are very pleased with the result,\u201d commented Can. \u201cWith the winner breaks format it means if you play well your opponent sometimes won\u2019t get many chances and that happened tonight.\nGermany was on the receiving end of a gift from Canada as they booked their place in the quarter-finals and a mouth-watering clash with Holland.\nRalf Souquet and Thorsten Hohmann, winners for Germany in 2011, took a commanding 5-2 lead but when they fouled three times Canada (Alex Pagulayan and John Morra) were awarded rack eight. A break and run closed the deficit to 5-4 and Pagulayan then levelled the scores with a smart 2/9.\nCanada moved ahead after Souquet got an attempted 6/8 wrong and looked set to see out the match until Morra missed what looked to be a simple eight ball. The crowd was left stunned but Germany stepped up to finish the job Canada couldn\u2019t and made it hill-hill.\nMorra\u2019s error proved the last shot of Canada\u2019s tournament as Germany saw out the deciding rack with a break and run.\n\u201cWhen you are 6-5 down, the opponents are shooting and easy eight ball and the nine wasn\u2019t that hard you think it is over,\u201d said Souquet. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even looking anymore.<|endoftext|>Public Remarks: Excellent Mixed Use Development property.

The network operated from the city of Malaga in southern Spain and used Spain as a transit country. The organization charged each migrant about 25,000 euros for providing passports, travel documents, transfers and accommodation in the final destinations. In total, 101 individuals were detained.\nSEF has played an important role in supporting investigations through the exchange of information, participation in operational meetings held at Europol and in the detention of several suspects in Portugal, namely at Faro and Porto Airports.

The oceanic hero was frequently the butt of jokes about his narrowly limited skill set \u2014 basically villains needed to be near the water in order for Aquaman to do battle with them, usually by using his telepathic ability to command fish. He was created by writer Mort Weisinger and illustrator Paul Norris, and for decades, this look with the superhero tights and the bleach blond hair was the image people recognized as the character.\nIn 2018 the character was reimagined in a big screen version starring Jason Mamoa, and now, like the actor, Polynesian. I thought this was an interesting tack to take, for the new look reminded me a good deal more of the character Aquaman was likely created to compete with in the first place: Namor, the Sub-Mariner, who had debuted in 1939.\nThe Sub-Mariner is a Marvel character, and to date there hasn\u2019t been a dedicated Sub-Mariner film, though some have been in the works. (The character is due to make his MCU debut in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever in November 2022). The Sub-Mariner is in the Marvel tradition of ambiguous anti-heroes. Sometimes he is not a hero at all, but more like a villain. And like Thor and some other Marvel characters his backstory is rooted in mythology. He is the daughter of a Princess of Atlantis, and goes around saying things like \u201cImperius Rex!\u201d and \u201cExcelsior!\u201d Originally inspired by Coleridge\u2019s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, his name happens to be \u201cRoman\u201d spelled backwards. Both Aquaman and the Sub-Mariner wield Neptune/Poseidon style tridents.\nAquaman\u2019s backstory in the comics was a little more prosaic. He was the son of a scientist who dove to bottom of the sea and found an Atlantis-like city there. He built an undersea lab and trained his son to have super-swimming skills and to communicate with the denizens of the deep. (In time he had his own charge, Aqualad, his \u201cRobin\u201d style sidekick). But the 2018 movie, once again, makes Aquaman more like the Sub-Mariner, a supernatural being with a mother from Atlantis.\nUnlike Superman, Batman and a handful of other Golden Age superheroes, Aquaman got no 1940s movie serials, although Johnny Weismuller was around then and would have been perfect casting. Underwater scenes were indeed possible at the time, you see them in studio ra pictures occasionally, but Aquaman has never been the same kind of draw as the Man of Steel or the Caped Crusader. Until now, that is is. The 2018 Aquaman movie has grossed over a billion dollars!

This can actually benefit many people, saving time, money and the publication of personal information.\nMediation offers one popular alternative to litigation. But how does it work, and what role does a mediator play in your divorce?\nForbes discusses the benefits associated with mediating a divorce, but what exactly do mediators do? In short, they act as overseers for the discussions of your divorce proceedings.\nUnlike judges or even arbitrators, mediators do not have any legal power over you or your spouse. They cannot make decisions for you. This often takes pressure away from discussion, as there is no oppressive authority figure present.\nMediators also offer a unique perspective: a third party with no bias or attachment to anyone in the divorce. This allows them to see things from an angle that you and your partner likely would not. They can offer opinions and advice that you would not have discovered or thought of on your own.\nThey also have training in de-escalation and in managing discussions and debates. In essence, they ensure that you and your partner both have an equitable amount of time and space to talk, and that neither of you feels spoken over or ignored.\nIf things get heated, they can also step in and bring the situation back down to manageable levels. Thus, they provide a safe and structured environment for people to work through any remaining struggles they may have in their divorce and reach an agreeable final arrangement.<|endoftext|>High quality RC truck (12mm hex pattern) tire hub.

Twisted Metal is a vehicular fight recreation franchise, a style that peaked over a decade in the past however has seen some renewed curiosity. Particulars about Twisted Steel\u2018s return have been intriguing, even hinting at a cross-promotional tv present coinciding with the sport\u2019s launch. Now, one other fascinating element in regards to the supposed Twisted Steel reboot has appeared; it may very well be a free-to-play recreation.\nIn a report from Video Video games Chronicle, the brand new Twisted Steel recreation is alleged to be focusing on a free-to-play launch construction. In different phrases, gamers can be free to entry and play the sport, which might fund itself via non-compulsory microtransactions. It is easy to see how Twisted Steel\u2018s arcade gameplay and fast rounds would swimsuit a free-to-play mannequin, comparable to how Rocket League has transformed free-to-play, too. Twisted Steel might additionally undertake Rocket League\u2019s cosmetics with skins and animations as microtransactions.\nThe choice to construct a free-to-play Twisted Steel recreation is partially as a result of rumored developer of this new recreation. It is stated to be Lucid Video games, the developer of Destruction All-Stars. Whereas Destruction All-Stars wasn\u2019t formally a free-to-play recreation, it could as effectively have been. It was launched as a free title via PlayStation Plus, obtainable for the sport\u2019s first two months. It was additionally closely criticized for its extreme microtransactions. Sony, nevertheless, should have seen one thing in Destruction All-Stars\u2019 monetization price elevating.\nSony has additionally spoken publically about its effort to, fairly particularly, \u201cdevelop extra service-led experiences.\u201d In saying so, Sony cited the success of MLB The Show 21, which drew more cash from gamers than some other sports activities recreation on the PlayStation retailer in its launch month. MLB The Present 21 featured randomized gacha playing mechanics very like what FIFA\u2018s Final Crew recreation mode has popularized.\nWhereas Twisted Steel itself stays a rumor, and a free-to-play Twisted Steel is simply one other rumor layered on high, there\u2019s clearly some concern about what the franchise will change into in Sony\u2019s new imaginative and prescient. With influences together with gacha monetization and Destruction All-Stars\u2018 aggressive microtransactions, the Twisted Steel model appears like it could getting used as a tool for aggressive monetization.\nIn fact, there\u2019s quite a lot of Twisted Steel followers who can be greater than keen to cope with heavy monetization if it meant the franchise\u2019s return. And even when it is closely monetized, that does not imply that the Twisted Steel gameplay facet of the expertise will likely be lessened. Regardless, with a rumored launch window of 2023, there\u2019s nonetheless lots left to seek out out about Twisted Metal\u2018s reboot.\nTwisted Steel is rumored for launch in 2023 on PlayStation consoles.\nAnthony Mackie was chosen to portray the role of John Doe in the live-action adaptation of the popular game franchise Twisted Metal.\nVeteran reporter and editor with over ten years of expertise.

In a normal crystal, such as diamond or salt, the atoms are arranged in a regularly repeating spatial pattern \u2013 a lattice or similar framework. And like most materials, when atoms are in their ground state \u2013 their lowest possible energy level \u2013 they stop shaking.\nTime crystals, on the other hand, are made up of atoms that repeat in time rather than space, oscillating back and forth or spinning, even in their ground state. They can maintain this motion perpetually, without requiring energy input or losing energy in the process.\nIn doing so, these time crystals can challenge a concept known as entropy. The second law of thermodynamics describes entropy as how any system becomes more disorderly over time. As an example, consider the orbits of the planets around the Sun. For simplicity, we imagine them moving in clockwork order, always returning to the same place at the same time in their respective orbits. In reality, however, things are messy: the gravity other planets, or passing stars, can shoot and shoot at the planets, subtly altering their orbits.\nHence the orbits of the planets are inherently chaotic. A small change to one of them can potentially have a big impact on all of them. The system becomes disordered over time \u2013 the entropy of the system increases.\nTime crystals can negate the effects of entropy due to a principle of quantum mechanics known as \u201cmultiple object localization\u201d. If a force is felt by an atom in the time crystal, it only affects that atom. Therefore, the change is considered localized rather than global (across the whole system). As a result, the system does not become chaotic and allows repeated oscillations to continue, theoretically, in perpetuity.\nAutti, who led the research, refers to Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle, which alludes to how, when a quantum system is observed and measured, its quantum wave function collapses. Due to their quantum mechanical nature, Time Crystals can only operate at 100% efficiency when completely isolated from their surroundings. This requirement limits the length of time they can be observed until they completely decay following a wave function collapse.\nHowever, Autti\u2019s team managed to connect two time crystals by cooling an amount of helium-3, an isotope of helium. Helium-3 is special because, when cooled to a fraction above absolute zero (minus 459.67 degrees Fahrenheit or minus 273 degrees Celsius), the isotope becomes a superfluid, which few materials can TO DO. In a superfluid there is no viscosity, so no kinetic energy is lost through friction, thus allowing motions \u2013 such as those of atoms in a time crystal \u2013 to continue indefinitely.\nAutti\u2019s team, working at Aalto University in Finland, then manipulated helium-3 atoms to create two time crystals that interacted with each other. Moreover, they observed this time-crystal pairing for a record duration, about 1000 seconds (nearly 17 minutes), which is equivalent to billions of periods of oscillatory movement or rotation of the atoms, before the function wave of time crystals does not decompose.\n\u201cIt turns out putting two of them together works wonders,\u201d Autti said.\nThe results create a promising line of research for the development of a fully functional system. quantum computer. While normal computer bits are binary \u2013 1 or 0, on or off \u2013 the processing rate of quantum computers is much faster because they use \u201cqubits\u201d, which can be 1 and 0, on and off at the same time. One way to build a quantum computer would be to link together myriad time crystals, each designed to act like a qubit. Therefore, this first experiment to link two time crystals created the cornerstone of a quantum computer.\nPrevious experiments have already shown that some time crystals can operate at room temperature, rather than needing to be cooled to near absolute zero, which makes building them even easier. The next task, Autti\u2019s team said, is to demonstrate that logic gate operations, which are functions that allow a computer to process information, can operate between two or more time crystals.\nThe research was published June 2 in the journal Nature Communication (opens in a new tab).<|endoftext|>I have cut a hole in my hull!<|endoftext|>It\u2019s short, but we found a nicely produced video of an ATV freestyler getting a little practice in.\nThe video shows Zach Wallinger messing around on a small jump and corner.

Not only can the bacteria itself cause problems, but the body\u2019s immune system can over-respond to the infection. Either process, or sometimes both, may harm joints, the heart, and/or the nervous system. And some people treated for any stage of Lyme disease develop post-Lyme disease syndrome, which can cause a range of debilitating symptoms that include fatigue, brain fog, and depression.\nUse repellents. You can buy clothing that\u2019s pretreated with the insecticide permethrin (which repels ticks). Or you can spray your own clothes and shoes; just be sure to follow the directions carefully. On all exposed skin, use a product that contains DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), IR3535, para-menthane-diol (PMD), or 2-undecanone. This search tool from the EPA can help you find a product best suited for your needs. Pay attention to the concentration of active ingredients: for example, at least 20% but not more than 50% with DEET; between 5% to 20% with picaridin; and 10% to 30% with oil of lemon eucalyptus. Many products come in pump spray bottles or as sticks or wipes, which may make them easier to apply where needed.Get a tick check. After spending time in tick-infested areas, ask a partner to check you for ticks in areas on your body that you can\u2019t see very well. The common bite areas are the back of the knee, the groin, under the arms, under the breasts in women, behind the ears, and at the back of the neck. The tick species that transmits Lyme disease is about the size of a sesame seed. Note that a tick has to be attached to your skin for 24 to 36 hours for it to transmit enough bacteria to give you the disease.<|endoftext|>Dow ends nearly 370 points higher as Nasdaq logs another...\nOil climbs, but U.S. benchmark ends lower for the week as...\nGold futures end lower for the session, but tally a 5th...\nDow rises 200 points on positive coronavirus treatment...\nYen Rises on Renewed Surge In Virus Cases; Dollar Index...\nEuropean markets close higher as Italian and French...\nNorth Korea Says It's Not Interested in Another Trump-Kim...\nApplications for unemployment benefits in the U.S. declined last week by more than projected, easing concerns of a renewed downturn in the labor market after several large states reported a pickup in coronavirus cases.

Cleveland is the only president to serve two non-consecutive terms (1885\u20131889 and 1893\u20131897) and therefore is the only individual to be counted twice in the numbering of the presidents. He was the winner of the popular vote for president three times\u2014in 1884, 1888, and 1892\u2014and was the only Democrat elected to the presidency in the era of Republican political domination that lasted from 1860 to 1912.\nCleveland was the leader of the pro-business Bourbon Democrats who opposed high tariffs, Free Silver, inflation, imperialism and subsidies to business, farmers or veterans. His battles for political reform and fiscal conservatism made him an icon for American conservatives of the era. Cleveland won praise for his honesty, independence, integrity, and commitment to the principles of classical liberalism. Cleveland relentlessly fought political corruption, patronage, and bossism. Indeed, as a reformer his prestige was so strong that the reform wing of the Republican Party, called \u201cMugwumps\u201d, largely bolted the GOP ticket and swung to his support in 1884.\nDisaster hit the nation a few months into his second term as the Panic of 1893 produced a severe national depression that Cleveland was unable to reverse. It ruined his Democratic party, opening the way for a Republican landslide in 1894, and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of his Democratic party in 1896. The result was a political realignment that ended the Third Party System and launched the Fourth Party System and the Progressive Era.<|endoftext|>and facilitating interaction on strategic matters among key stakeholders.\nThe Farmers' Advocate Office (FAO) was established in 1973 by the former Minister of Agriculture as a resource for Albertan farmers and ranchers. Today the FAO remains within the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and works to ensure the rights and interests of rural Albertans are recognized, understood, and protected.\nNegotiating Renewable Energy Leases was first released in February 2017 in response to requests from Albertan landowners for additional resources to aid in the negotiation of wind and solar leases. This publication collects the relevant information from the different regulators, departments, and agencies within the province to help landowners ask informed questions and evaluate the opportunity of having a power plant on their land or within their community. As an advocate, the FAO does not create policy, but will provide comment on existing laws and policies and work as a liaison between landowners, industry, government, and regulators.\nNote: The recommendations in this document are targeted towards lease agreements where the renewable energy developer owns and operates the technology and infrastructure, connects into the grid, and compensates the landowner for the use of the land. This guide is not intended for micro-generation(landowners who are purchasing and installing wind or solar power generation infrastructure for their own personal use). Landowners wishing to install micro-generation infrastructure to meet their own electricity needs may want to contact the Alberta Utilities Commission (AUC) for additional information.\nIn 2015, the Government of Alberta released the Climate Leadership Plan. The plan articulated a goal of phasing out coal fired emissions and moving towards having 30% of Alberta's energy coming from renewable sources by 2030. The Government of Alberta directed the Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO) to develop and implement a program to meet the goal of 30% by 2030.\nDesigned and administered by AESO, the Renewable Energy Program (REP) will add 5,000 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy capacity to the grid by 2030, starting with the first procurement process for 400MW in spring 2017. The intent of the program is to keep costs as low as possible through a competitive process and operate the program concurrent to the retirement of coal generation.\n1. Request for Expressions of Interest (REOI) 4-6 weeks.\nThe purpose of this stage is to gauge the level of interest. Developers have no obligation to participate in subsequent stages after they submit an Expression of Interest.\n2. Request for Qualifications (RFQ) 4-6 months.\nDuring this stage, the eligibility requirements of developers wishing to bid during the RFP stage are assessed. Developers must submit their project proposals at this stage. Only qualified bidders can move on to the RFP stage.\n3. Request for Proposals (RFP) 2-3 months.\nThe RFP stage determines which developers bidding to receive support payments will be entered into a Renewable Electricity Support Agreement (RESA).\nFor landowners, the significance of this process is in the timelines developers are facing. It is important to understand that not all options to lease will result in a renewable energy development being constructed. Additionally, a landowner should be aware that if the developer is successful in their bid to the AESO, the developer may opt to sell the package to a more financially able company for construction and operation. This means that the developer you negotiate with may not be the same company that operates the site.\nProjects submitted to the program must meet certain eligibility requirements, including being 5 MW or greater in size and, for the first round of REP, they must be able to be operational by December 1, 2019. Successful applicants (\"proponents\") will receive a 20-year contract. Proponents will be paid a certain $/megawatt per hour payment that reflects the difference between their bid price and the Alberta pool price, which helps provide stability for the developer.\nIn addition to the 30% by 2030 goal, Alberta's electricity market is moving towards a capacity market, where generators will be"

Why would Wilson High School want to lose a veteran teacher with a stellar record in AP at this critical juncture in the history of the D.C. school system? Every principal is eager to recruit and retain teachers of Martel\u2019s caliber. Their complaint is that they can\u2019t find enough of them.\nYet the situation at Wilson High School is not unique. When Lee McCaskill was principal of Brooklyn Technical, one of New York City\u2019s elite high schools, he was responsible for creating such rancor among teachers who questioned his decisions that many of the best transferred. McCaskill was the subject of several columns in the New York Times in 2004 and 2005 (\u201cPrincipals\u2019 War Leads to a Teacher Exodus,\u201d and \u201cA Bully on the Wrong Side of the Principal\u2019s Desk\u201d). McCaskill not only was unscathed by the criticism and publicity but was defended by district officials. In fact, he was allowed to retire days before the completion of an investigation into his daughter\u2019s improper enrollment in a Brooklyn elementary school.\nI expect that Cahall will be treated with similar deference. The truth is that principals have enormous power as a result of the state education code, board of education policies and court decisions. Unless principals are blatantly incompetent, they tend to remain in their jobs. Nevertheless, principals can be evaluated using multiple measures. The most obvious is the progress that their students make on standardized tests from year to year. They can also be assessed by their own faculty. Every year, United Teachers of Los Angeles uses principal surveys for this purpose. Parents can be included in these surveys. Finally, the ratings of those above principals in the chain of command should count.\nReformers, however, prefer to lambaste unions for protecting lousy teachers. Where are they on the issue of lousy principals?<|endoftext|>package deconz\n\n// Devices is a map of devices indexed by their id\ntype Devices map[string]Device // UniqueID -> Device\n\n// Device is a device like a Light, Sensor(Motion, Contact, Switch)\ntype Device struct {\n\tType     string\n\tName     string\n\tDeviceID string `json:\"uniqueid\"`\n}<|endoftext|>More disruption is to be expected for Derby and Derbyshire motorists today as the national fuel crisis continues and Army tanker drivers are placed on standby.
