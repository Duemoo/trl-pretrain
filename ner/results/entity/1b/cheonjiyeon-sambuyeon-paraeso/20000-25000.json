Chief among them was the sentiment that somehow, there was a conflict between the celestial bodies.\nLivescience writes that during a 16th-century eclipse, ancient Aztecs reacted to an eclipse in what was described as \u201ctumult and disorder.\u201d The detailed account, taken by the missionary Fray Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan, goes on to describe shouting and sacrifices of lighter-skinned people alongside general panic that the Sun might disappear forever, and demons of darkness would come down and eat people.\nTime has shown that this panic was unfounded, but myths continue be part of the folklore.\nFrom dangers to pregnant women to colorful flowers, these are the 5 of the top solar eclipse superstitions.\nIt might be hard to picture panic ensuing during an eclipse in modern day North America, but according to Livescience, ancient peoples sought to explain an eclipse the best way they could.\nSome cultures believed gods and demons were involved, while others cited dragons. The Shan people, (located in present-day Vietnam) thought it was an evil spirit that took the form of a toad.\nHide your kids! Hide your wife!\nIt is unclear where this wive\u2019s tale (pardon the pun) originates, but it persists. In the cultures where this myth is believed, women and small children are advised to stay indoors during an eclipse.\nAccording to Space.com, some cultures also believed that children born during an eclipse would turn into mice.\nIn India, some cultures opt to fast during an eclipse. This is done because it is believed that any food cooked during an eclipse is impure, or worse, poisonous.\nItalians have long believed that if flowers are planted during an eclipse, they will be more colorful when it\u2019s time to bloom.\nSettle your differences.\nThe Batammaliba of Togo and Benin believe an eclipse happens because the Sun and Moon are fighting one another. In order to get the Sun back, people on Earth are advised to settle their differences and make peace.\nAccording to NASA, the last total solar eclipse taking place over contiguous United States occurred on Feb. 26, 1979.\nThere will be an annular solar eclipse that will take place on October 14, 2023 and there will be another total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024.<|endoftext|>Hollywood \u2013 An employee at a marijuana dispensary in Hollywood was killed Thursday night during an apparent robbery, police said. The death was reported about 9:05 p.m. in the 1600 block of North El Centro Avenue, just north of the Hollywood Palladium, according to Los Angeles police.\nIt was not clear if the apparent robbery and killing were related to an earlier armed robbery at an Echo Park marijuana dispensary where one employee was shot dead and another was critically injured, Rayner said.\n\u201cThe sole employee in the store was found dead by the owner of the store,\u201d Los Angeles police Sgt. Don Lawrence of the Hollywood Station said.\nLawrence said he did not know whether the person was shot, or how he or she died.\nAn investigation was under way at the scene, Lawrence said.\nCapt.

As a Jewish Student who helped fight the BDS movement on his campus I know how insane and twisted the left can be, and most of my fellow Jews are even left. \n\nCase and point, I remember taking an American Studies course and Israel was constantly and abhorrently bashed. Though Anti Zionist and Anti Israel positions are perfectly legitimate on the left and even in the libertarian and conservative movements. Even someone with Nazi Ideology putting the legitimate form of Hinduisms symbol is subject to the moral gray area of free speech. \n\nI think we have to be very careful about how we approach this issue. I mean, one thing liberalism doesn't teach besides cultural recognition as this article points out is common sense. If you're a Jewish student and you want to delegitimize Jewish fraternities on campus the best way to do it is fake Antisemitism and make the issue less serious than it actually is when it happens. The trick is to catch Anti-Israeli, Anti Zionist, Anti-Jewish sentiment in the process of ad hominems against a specific individual, or when a person is legitimately made to feel not safe because of it and it is used in such a way to make someone feel unsafe. \n\nIf someone is doing an artistic expression, fully knowing that it might affect a Jewish individual on campus at what point does it cross the boundaries? If I, as a photographer took pictures of swastikas and called it art would that still be artistic expression? This issue is so complex, but so simple at the same time. Frankly, and coming from a liberal background myself before waking up. Liberals have a complex. they don't know how to stand up for themselves, it's always someone else doing the work for them. At our schools BDS hearing all the SJP students that spoke weren't even associated with the under graduate division or no longer going to the school while all the Jewish and Students in favor of Israel were.\n\nFreedom of Speech is wonderful, but common sense is just as well. \n\nand that's a beautiful rendering of a \"swastika\" I think art is a wonderful way to take the hate out of something.<|endoftext|>Matty90 condivide alcuni suoi interventi solo con i suoi amici.

The abnormal protrusion of the digestive organs within the said thoracic muscle causes a lot of symptoms that causes discomfort. There are three main types of hiatal hernia, namely; 1. Sliding hernia (most common) which accounts for nearly 90% of all cases, 2. Paraesophageal or rolling hernia, and 3. Mixed hernia. Sliding hernia is characterized by the slipping of both the stomach and gastroesophageal junction into the chest. Paraesophageal hernia on the other hand is the protrusion of the greater curvature of the stomach through the diaphragmatic defect. Mixed hernia resembles both the sliding and rolling hernia.\nThe esophagus is a 25 cm long collapsible tube that extends from the pharynx to the stomach"

There\u2019s even the feeling that we can do anything we want without ever being detected. Except, we never were. Or so says Google and Facebook. This may be shocking to some but watching porn with the private browsing and incognito mode setting turned on is not actually that private or incognito. Yeap, you read that right.\nAccording to The Star, an author of a recent study on privacy standards of porn websites, tech giants such as Google and Facebook are still be able to track down your porn watching activities, even in incognito mode. Uh oh.\nThe study, titled \u201cTracking sex: The Implications Of Widespread Sexual Data Leakage And Tracking On Porn Websites\u201d, analyzed 22,484 pornography websites and found that 93% leaked user data to third parties.\nThe research found that Google (and its subsidiaries) had trackers on 74% of the porn sites, Facebook on 10% and Oracle on 24%.\nHowever, a Google spokeswoman told The New York Times that it does not use the information to build advertising profiles. Whew, that\u2019s a relief. Right?\n\u201cWe don\u2019t allow Google Ads on websites with adult content, and we prohibit personalised advertising and advertising profiles based on a user\u2019s sexual interest or related activities online. Additionally, tags for our ad services are never allowed to transmit personally identifiable information,\u201d said the spokeswoman.\nDespite a similar statement given by Facebook, Oracle, on the other hand, did not respond to the New York Times.\nAlthough it is not clear what the data is being used for, the authors warned that the collection of this type of data is dangerous and can be used against a person. For instance, the data could be used to damage the reputation of a public figure.\n\u201cThese risks are heightened for vulnerable populations whose porn usage might be classified as non-normative or contrary to their public life,\u201d said the authors.\nAccording to an interview with the New York Times, one of the authors, Elena Maris from Microsoft Research, said that the mechanism used for adult site tracking is similar to online stores, and it should be a huge red flag, as it\u2019s much more specific and deeply personal.\nThere are also security concerns, as hackers have previously stolen email addresses, passwords, usernames, and credit card information from some of the sites.\n\u201cPorn sites currently operate with an unethical definition of sexual consent considering the sensitive sexual data they hold. We contend the overwhelming leakiness and sexual exposure revealed in our results mean porn sites ought to better account for user security as well as adopt policies based on affirmative consent,\u201d said the authors.\nThey said regulatory intervention could provide better protection, adding that the European Union\u2019s GDPR (General Data Protection"

An improper pool closing is going to mean a not so happy pool opening when the open season comes. In this article, we are going to talk about how to avoid certain mistakes when closing your pool.\nMany homeowners are going to rush the process due to the thought of their pool getting dirty during the winter. There is no need to rush the winterization of your pool as long as your water is in good shape and you have a proper pool cover. Having a proper pool cover that fits tightly and keeps out debris and any small animals will help you open up to a beautiful pool next season.\nDumping a bump of winterizing chemicals into the water isn\u2019t going to help anyone. Yes, you need these chemicals and when you use them properly, they are going to make a major difference when you open your pool in the spring. The thing you should think about is the balance of the pH being between 7.2 and 7.6, the alkalinity being between 80-120 ppm and making sure the calcium hardness is between 180-220ppm.\nIf you have even a handful of leaves or a little bit of dirt at the bottom of your pool, it doesn\u2019t matter how many chemicals you put in your pool when you are closing your pool. You are likely to open it to see a not so clean pool.\nJust because you\u2019ve drained \u201cmost of the water\u201d, it doesn\u2019t mean things are going to end well for you. Make sure you get every bit of water out of the pump and filter system.\nAs long as you keep up with closing your pool properly and do not commit the above mistakes, you should open up a pool that looks good in the spring. Instead of worrying about whether you are doing everything right, you can contact your local pool professional and have them check the work you\u2019ve done or you could have them do it for you.\nThere is no need to stress out over your pool when you have professionals that have years of experience dealing with winterization, installation and more. Making sure that you protect your investment throughout the winter is important. You never know what you may want to add to your pool next year and if you have to make repairs, you may eat up your budget and not be able to make additions.\nMake sure everything is put together properly so that you can enjoy a stress-free winter and a fun time spring when your pool opens up for swimming again.<|endoftext|>Not everybody is lucky enough to discover their vocation immediately.

I have always been closer with my dad and we've always had a strong good relationship,\" Hannah shared. \"It's a lot, growing up in a very busy household with lots of kids. And there's not really a one-on-one relationship, for attention, that you have with your parent. I felt like my dad gave me that attention and a feeling like I had a good solid relationship with a parent.\"\nAs of August 2021, Hannah and her brother Collin have lived full-time with Jon while the other four of the sextuplets -- Leah, Joel, Alexis and Aaden -- live with Kate. Jon and Kate also share 21-year-old twins, Cara and Madelyn, who are away at college.\n\"It was a difficult decision leaving my siblings I did not want to be separated from them or even, like, live in a different household than them,\" Hannah explained. \"But I just feel like there was unfair treatment in my mom's house and I just wanted to live with my dad.\"\nAccording to Hannah, she still keeps in touch with her mom frequently, and says she's \"pretty sure she's doing OK.\"\n\"I mean we don't really speak on a basis of, like, 'Oh, how's your life going?' It's more like day-to-day, 'Oh how's your day?' But I\u2019m pretty sure she's doing well,\" Hannah said. \"And I\u2019m sure my siblings are doing well too.\"\nHannah celebrated her 18th birthday on May 10, and she says she received a birthday greeting from her mother.\n\"She just, you know, wished me a happy birthday. You know, told me she loved me and it was great, an average birthday text,\" she shares.\nAs for her siblings that don't live with her, she shared that they also wished each other a happy birthday.\n\"Oh, 100 percent, I miss my siblings,\" she notes. \"I mean, we all do share, like, the same birthday, it's a big day for all of us today. As soon as I woke up they texted me happy birthday and I sent them a happy birthday text back.\"<|endoftext|>1.

As the resolution of SAR images increases, small targets present more pixels in SAR images. So the target distribution is of much significance. Distribution-based CFAR detection algorithm is presented. We unite the pixels around the test cell, and estimate the distribution of test cell by them. Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) is used to deduce the detectors. The performance of the distribution-based CFAR (DBCFAR) detectors is analyzed theoretically. False alarms of DBCFAR detection are fewer than those of CFAR at the same detection rate. Finally experiments are done and the results show the performance of DBCFAR is out of conventional CFAR.

Nevertheless, we wandered through the food street, past murals painted on walls and past an \uc5b4\ub9b0\uc774\uc9d1 where the cutest kid started waving to us much to the surprise of his teacher who was busy on her phone.\nWhy can\u2019t offices be this colourful?\nWe stopped at the supermarket and managed to get some bread sticks (explain to me why loaves of bread are so uncommon in Korea) which we ended up having with our duty free cheese, oranges and random assortment of other food for lunch and dinner. We still had not managed to eat our apples which we had bought the day before since, strangely enough, there were no knives to be found anywhere \u2013 not in the grocery stores, nor at the hotel. We called it a day early and even messaged Mr. Song to let him know that we had decided to scratch the short climb on Mt. Halla the next morning from our itinerary and instead rest our weary legs which had, by the estimation of our S health trackers, made it to our personal best for two consecutive days.\nAfter the hectic rush of Day 1, we somehow managed to get a good night\u2019s sleep and were up bright and early on Day 2- finally ready to start our tour of Jeju. After breakfast, that is. Breakfast was tea from Caffe Pascucci, bananas and some duty free goodies and by 10am we were meeting Mr. Song, who\u2019d be driving us around for the day. The plan was to start of at Cheonjiyeon Falls which is hardly 5 minutes from the hotel, then make our way to Jusangjeolli Cliffs, Cheonjeyeon Falls and wrap up with a trip to the Joreunmosal Beach.\nThe walk from the parking lot to the Cheonjiyeon falls was simply beautiful. Having grown up in a country where deciduous trees are something of a rarity and summer all year round means the trees are always green and flowers forever in bloom, this was my first glimpse of a barren winter starting to be covered with the first colourful blossoms of spring. Evergreen boughs interlaced with barren branches and the first red, yellow and pink children of the spring. It was breathtaking and probably even more so for those people who had weathered the long white winter.\nThe sound of the falls was so soothing that if I hadn\u2019t been on a schedule, I would have been pretty happy to spend the day sitting by the water, feeding the passing ducks. As it were, we were on a schedule, and unfortunately huge numbers of tourist buses had begun to arrive which signaled the arrival of lots of noisy tourists armed with selfie-sticks, which meant it was time for us to move on.\nWe headed next to the cliffs, a little over half an hour away. By the time we reached there, I was truly beginning to understand why Jeju is also known as \uc0bc\ub2e4\ub3c4\u2026 being famous for having lots of wind, stones and women \ubc14\ub78c. \ub3cc. \uc5ec\uc790. The wind was biting cold as we made our way to the viewing platform for a sight of the stunning hexagonal stone columns left by cooling lava from the last volcanic eruption.\nWe spent some time walking in the area but as the wind picked up, we packed up and headed off for lunch.We had initially thought of stopping at Paris Baguette, but Mr. Song was nice enough to suggest a more picturesque location, past yellow canola fields with a beautiful view of the sea- Cafe 7373. We tried our luck finding something halal and the staff was nice enough to accommodate our requests so we ended up having a lunch of garlic bread, salad, fresh grape juice and a salmon baguette. The view was pretty spectacular and Mr. Song said this was the best place to come to watch the sunset. I can\u2019t disagree.\nFrom Cafe 7373 we headed to Cheonjeyeon Falls which consists of 3 waterfalls. Unfortunately for us, the first waterfall was not in a falling mood, so we moved down to the second and third waterfall viewing areas.\nThe third waterfall area was probably my favourite- the last fall before which the water flows away into the sea. Cheonjeyeon didn\u2019t just have waterfalls to offer, but also our first taste of Jeju\u2019s famous Hallabong oranges as we rested before climbing up the Seonimgyo Bridge for a stunning aerial view of the area.\nOur last stop for the day before heading back to the hotel was Joreunmosal Beach, because one can never have enough water in a day. While this isn\u2019t exactly one of Jeju\u2019s most famous beaches,that is exactly what lends it its charm- peace and some much-needed silence to drink up the sound of the waves lapping the shore. The beach is tucked away in a corner, reached only by a long spindly stone path lined with flowers and trees on either side, the last steps covered with sand \u2013 as the beach meets the forest. We spent a long time there, just breathing in the salty air, filling our shoes with sand and looking for shells.\nI\u2019m not exactly sure how it happened, but one moment we had no vacation plans and the next we were applying for visas to South Korea during mum\u2019s Spring Break. Needless to say our itinerary revolved primarily around chasing the cherry blossoms around the country, from Jeju to Jinhae up to Seoul, for what would be our first real Spring.\nWe were scheduled to take the midnight flight to Seoul with a four hour window in which to catch the 8.30pm flight to Jeju which meant that we should have slept earlier during the day to avoid jet-lag but us, being us, couldn\u2019t sleep and ended up falling asleep shortly after boarding \u2013 in fact so soon after boarding that we didn\u2019t realize the flight took off about half an hour late. Squeeze aforesaid window to 3.5 hours. Already the plan that took weeks to calibrate was beginning to look too tight. Strike 1.\nWe were optimistic though that we\u2019d be able to make it on time. Immigration after all, at Incheon Airport, couldn\u2019t possibly take that long. It wasn\u2019t like there were millions of Chinese tourists like in Japan\u2026 right? Wrong! Strike 2. It took over an hour at immigration just to reach the immigration desk (Shrunken window \u2013 2 hours) where Strike 3 took place in the form of our Pakistani passport. Now we\u2019ve never had a problem travelling before, but it would appear that the rules in South Korea are a little unfavourable towards Pakistanis, in that Pakistanis coming from Pakistan are subjected to more rigorous questioning. That shouldn\u2019t have mattered to us of course, since we\u2019ve never lived in Pakistan but the ladies at the immigration counter were confused as to what to do with Pakistanis who don\u2019t live in Pakistan and decided to play it safe and send us all for questioning too. -_- The staff was wonderfully polite which was great because my nerves were wrecked as I was beginning to come to the conclusion that we were not going to catch our next flight. They simply asked us about our itinerary which we had handy, cross-checked our hotel bookings, and gave us the sound advice that we would have to make a run for it if we were going to make it to Jeju that night. Stamp, stamp, stamp and half an hour later we were scrambling towards baggage claim, the money exchange and then down to B1F, running to catch the AREX. (Vanishing window \u2013 little over 1 hour).\nOf course we needed to get a SIM card because I was supposed to contact our tour guide in Jeju to let him know that we had arrived and what time to pick us up the next morning \u2013 this meant further delays in the form of an excellent gentlemen who meticulously set up our EG SIM Cards while I ran to get the AREX tickets (Is it still a window if there\u2019s only an hour left? When does check-in close again?) With promises of our SIM cards being activated at the latest by 9am the next morning we piled on to the AREX and began counting the stops down to Gimpo Airport.\nThe ride was comfortable and uneventful with the exception of the rather drunk \uc544\uc800\uc528 who boarded at a later stop and decided to amuse himself by removing the stickers labelling each stop on the map, much to the chagrin of the many \uc544\uc90c\ub9c8s on board whose stares did little to dissuade him. I managed to get a hold of our guide on the train and let him know that our schedule had suddenly been thrown wide open to the possibility of change. We then ran through Plan Bs, Cs and Ds which involved all manner of rescheduling and re-bookings while a Korean Air air hostess seated opposite us continued to chat away on her phone in what may be the most silent conversation I have (n)ever heard. By the time we reached Gimpo our so-called window was narrowing quickly and as luck would have it, the AREX does not stop, as we had prayed, exactly at the departures gate. In fact, there is a lot of walking (in our case mad dashing) to be done before reaching domestic departures. For someone who\u2019s never, and I mean never, ever, ever, been late for anything, this was turning into an absolutely unanticipated nightmare.\nI ran on ahead to see if we had a sliver of a chance of boarding, while my brother and my mum hurried on behind.

We should be part of the conversation that these arts represent, instead of leaving it all to ivory-tower professors with their thumpingly dull ideas of what art should be (first dogma: If it doesn't need a tenured professor to explain it, then it can't be good art).\nAnd right now, for this fleeting moment, because of who is President of the United States, the National Endowment for the Arts is actually in the hands of a great artist whose labor has been, and is now, to bring art back to life in the hearts, the minds, the daily experience of millions of Americans who yearn for it, without knowing that they have suffered for lack of it.\nAs a practicing nongreat poet myself, let me show you something that I wrote in response to my conversation with Gioia. He had talked about the lack of poetry as part of our public conversation. Where are the political poems? he asked.\nNaturally, I wrote one -- though of course it reflects my politics, not Gioia's. As head of the NEA, he has no politics at the moment. It's one of the sacrifices you make when you take a job like that.\nGreat poetry? Most definitely not! But is it funny? More importantly, is it more funny because it's in verse, because it rhymes? And does that make the underlying truth -- that our primary system is corrupted by the need for candidates to raise vast amounts of money -- more visible, or at least more entertaining?\nThere are those who think that for verse to be \"poetry\" it should have a serious literary purpose. But this is an absurd distinction. My political purpose is serious; my means is humorous and light; but in order to achieve both seriousness and lightness, I still need to know my craft well enough to make sure the poem is brief, scans well, rhymes aptly, and is instantly readable.\nThat, folks, is poetry. It's just not the same kind of poetry that literary magazines deem worthy of publication. So what? You just read it in a different kind of publication.<|endoftext|>[Diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in esophageal carcinoma: detecting with coronal magnetic resonance imaging].\n\nTo assess the utility of MR imaging in diagnosis of lymph node metastasis, the author studied 70 patients with histologically proved esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Coronal spin echo imaging (SE400/40) was the most available method in the mediastinum and using this method, lymph nodes were clearly imaged along trachea and vessels of the mediastinum in its long axis. The 250 lymph nodes from 44 patients who underwent laparotomy, thoracotomy and cervical dissection, were reviewed for findings by coronal MRI. Detectability of lymph nodes was 141/250 (56%) in total. Cervical and paraesophageal nodes were unable to detect well, but paratracheal, subcarinal, hilar nodes, supraclavicular nodes which are clinically important region for lymph node dissection of esophageal surgery were well-detected. Distinction between metastatic and non-metastatic nodes was studied on its size and its location. The supraclavicular and paratracheal nodes larger than 1.5 cm in diameter were involved in cancer invasion for the most part.<|endoftext|>What is.miami?\nMiami is a new top-level domain targeted to Miami businesses, brands, and individuals.

Biological, social and environmental factors influence its occurrence and transmission. The first effective treatments appeared in 1930 with the development of dapsone, a sulfone. The main components of a control and elimination strategy are early case detection and timely administration of multidrug therapy. OBJECTIVES Review the history of leprosy control in Cuba, emphasizing particularly results of the National Leprosy Control Program, its modifications and influence on leprosy control. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION The historiological method was applied using document review, complemented by interviews with experts on leprosy and its control. Archived documents, medical records, disease prevalence censuses conducted since 1942, and incidence and prevalence statistics for 1960-2015 from the Ministry of Public Health's National Statistics Division were reviewed. Reports and scientific literature published on the Program and the history of leprosy in Cuba were also reviewed. DEVELOPMENT Leprosy has been documented in Cuba since 1613. In 1938, the Leprosy Foundation was created with ten dispensaries nationwide for diagnosis and treatment. The first National Leprosy Control Program was established in 1962, implemented in 1963 and revised five times. In 1972, leper colonies were closed and treatment became ambulatory. In 1977, rifampicin was introduced. In 1988, the Program instituted controlled, decentralized, community-based multidrug treatment and established the criteria for considering a patient cured. In 2003, it included actions aimed at early diagnosis and prophylactic treatment of contacts. Since 2008, it prioritizes actions directed toward the population at risk, maintaining five-year followup with dermatological and neurological examination. Primary health care carries out diagnostic and treatment activities. The lowest leprosy incidence of 1.6 per 100,000 population was achieved in 2006. Since 2002, prevalence has remained steady at 0.2 per 10,000 population. Leprosy ceased to be considered a public health problem in Cuba as of 1993. In 1990-2015, 1.6% of new leprosy patients were aged <15 years. At present, late diagnosis of cases exceeds 20%, which leads to a high percentage of grade 2 disability in such patients. Spontaneous physician visits by already symptomatic patients surpassed 70% of cases diagnosed in 2010-2015. CONCLUSIONS Actions undertaken after initial detection of leprosy in Cuba failed to control it. Effective control began in 1963, with the implementation of the National Leprosy Control Program, whose systematic actions have had an impact on trends in leprosy, reflected in WHO's 1993 declaration that leprosy was no longer a public health problem in Cuba.

Partial or complete?\n\nHiatal hernia repair and the performance of a fundoplication are separate propositions in the management of the patient with a paraesophageal hernia. Except under certain circumstances, such as gastric necrosis or the patient in extremis, a fundoplication should be performed. A 360, Nissen fundoplication or magnetic sphincter augmentation is recommended in patients with good esophageal motility. A 270, Toupet fundoplication is recommended in patients with poor motility and dysphagia, or in whom esophageal motility could not be determined.<|endoftext|>A novel design silicone oil removal cannula\n\nBackground: Silicone oil, which is one of the most commonly used endotamponades in vitreoretinal surgery, is removed after a certain period of time in most cases. In this study, we present our results with a unique cannula that provides effective and safe silicone oil removal.\nAims and Objectives: To assess the aids and success of silicone oil removal with a novel 23-gauge cannula for the patients who underwent pars plana vitrectomy and silicone oil injection before.\nMaterials and Methods: 72 eyes of 64 patients who operated by the same surgeon (FA) between May 2017 and May 2019 were involved in the study. The primary indications were proliferative diabetic retinopathy in 46 (63.9%) eyes and retinal detachment in 26 (36.1%) eyes. Phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation (23 eyes), membrane peeling (23 eyes), internal limiting membrane peeling (5 eyes), and argon laser endo-photocoagulation (37 eyes) performed in the same session. Furthermore, perfluorocarbon remnants aspirated in 9 eyes and 17 eyes needed suturing. Descriptive statistical analyses achieved by SPSS 10.5 statistical software.\nResults: The mean follow-up time was 11.7 + 2.5 months (between 3 and 23 months), and the mean age was 61.4 + 8.52 years (between 44 and 69 years). 1000 centistokes (cSt) silicone oil was removed from 61 (84.7%) eyes, and 5000 cSt silicone oil was removed from 11 (15.3%) eyes. The mean removal time was 2.04 + 0.1 min for 1000 cSt silicone oil and 5.11 + 0.3 min for 5000 cSt silicone oil. 4 re-detachment and 3 vitreous hemorrhage observed in follow-up period. Post-operative silicone oil remnants were not detected in any patient.\nConclusion: The unique 23-gauge cannula provides silicone oil removal without any conjunctival cut-down and sclerotomy enlargement. Thus, it reduces the duration of surgery and post-operative recovery period.<|endoftext|>The next challenge to interoperability? A first look at robotic system wireless interoperability in emergency response.\n\nSystem interoperability enables public safety agencies to communicate and share information. Past failures have demonstrated that systems of different agencies are not inherently interoperable. Therefore, as efforts continue toward the resolutions of these problems, it is incumbent on technology developers to assess the interoperability of new systems. Robotic systems can offer new capabilities to public safety personnel; however, these systems also include new communication technology to share and distribute information. Research has been initiated to examine the interoperability of public safety robotic systems. Definitions for robotic communication interoperability types are introduced.<|endoftext|>Treatment of U92+\u2013U91+ collisions in spherical co-ordinates: going beyond the monopole approximation\n\nRecently, a new approach has been developed to treat the time-dependent two-centre Dirac equation within our group. This method generates basis wavefunctions describing an electron in the field of two nuclei at fixed internuclear distances in spherical co-ordinates, and uses coupled-channel techniques in handling the time dependences. Using this method, we analyse the electronic properties accompanying a U92+\u2013U91+ collision for a zero-impact parameter. Specifically, the ground state occupation probability and the ionization probability has been calculated. Based on our calculations, we show the importance of using higher multipole terms in the expansion of the two-centre potential.<|endoftext|>Acoustooptic Interaction In Ti-Diffused LiNbO3 Waveguides\n\nThe theoretical studies and experimental researches results of Bragg acoustooptic interaction in planar waveguide are presented. The graded index waveguide was obtained by the Ti diffusion into a lithium niobate single crystals. The interaction efficiency analysis was made versus acoustical power for both TE and TM modes. The wide-band 200 - 400 MHz transducer has been used. The 30 % interaction efficiency was obtained for the 0,5 W of acoustic power.<|endoftext|>Image consumption and trans-local discursive practice: Decoding advertisements in the Taipei MRT Mall*\n\nAdvertising in public places such as the malls or main streets of Asian cities is a helpful site for comprehending global\u2013local cultural dialectics. Accordingly, I will begin this discussion by looking briefly at a few billboards in the Taipei Metro Rapid Transit (MRT) Mall, and reflect on the ways in which the phenomenon designated by Virginia Woolf as \u2018feminine sentences\u2019 seems to be at work within the advertisements, as they address the desires of young consumers for social distinction and trans-local identity. In order to understand advertising\u2019s exercise in the writing of such feminine sentences, and to understand them as the cultural products and discursive practices of a particular society, we shall consider Taiwan\u2019s virtually unique politico-historical formation in relation to the global cultural economy. I will argue that the currently available models for cultural studies need to be contested or, at least, rearticulated, to provide more adequate, critical, nuanced and sensible accounts of contemporary public culture.

The park is 2.3 times the size of Yeouido Park and includes 20-plus thematic gardens under the six grand categories of Ecology, Bamboo, Season, Aquatic Plants, Participation, and Mugunghwa.\nMake sure to explore the Taehwagang Observatory, Bora Garden, and the Galaxy Trail when visiting the thematic gardens found between Taehwa and Samho areas. The observatory is fashioned out of an old water tower and offers a great view of the Taehwagang River and the national garden. From late summer to fall, big blue lilyturfs color the Bora Garden violet, while the Galaxy Trail is the premier place to socialize at night, thanks to the extravagant LED lighting in the bamboo forest.\nIt takes about 40\u201350 min to reach the meeting point from the Donghae Line Taehwagang Station. Take Bus 327, 357, or 708 to Taehwa-dong bus stop, and walk for 400 m toward the river.\nA massive chunk of granite off the coast of Ulsan is perched on the East Sea like a twisted, writhing dragon. Visitors can either observe the rock from the land or opt to cross the bridge to the rock. Daewangam Park is a seaside park built around a pine forest. It was called Ulgi Park following the Ulgi Lighthouse built during the Russo-Japanese War of 1906 by Japanese imperialist forces. The name was changed in 2006 during the 100th anniversary of the lighthouse\u2019s construction, following petitions to remove the traces of Japanese imperialist violence in the region. Daewangam Rock has several different names associated with different local legends. The name Yongchuam is inspired by the legend of the rock being a fallen dragon from the heavens, while another legend claims that the queen of King Munmu of Silla is buried here, having decided to follow her husband and become the guardian dragon of the East Sea. The suspension bridge to the island was laid in 1978, and the arch bridge was donated by Hyundai Heavy Industries in 1995. Moreover, the Daewangyo Bridge was installed in 2016. Don\u2019t miss the view of the waves breaking on the cliff as you cross the island.\nThe view at Daewangam Park is beloved day and night. As night falls, Daewanggyo Bridge is illuminated in rainbow colors. It is one of the three top night views in Ulsan, along with the illuminated Ulsan Petrochemical Industry Complex at night and the view of downtown Ulsan from the Ulsandaegyo Observatory.\nYeongnam Alps is the mountain range at the border region between Gyeongsangbuk-do and Gyeongsangnam-do, named after the famous European mountain range. It is home to nine peaks with over 1,000 m above sea level in height, with Gajisan Mountain at 1,241 m as the highest. Yeongnam Alps is one of the favorite places of seasoned trekkers in Korea, as any of the nine peaks offer a majestic view of the mountain and the surrounding areas. It is home to many scenic sites and hidden views because this is the only place in Korea where multiple peaks over 1,000 m in height can be found grouped together. Geumgang Falls, a beloved place of rock climbers, is a triple waterfall along a long cliff. Sinbulsan Mountain\u2019s Gongnyong Ridge is named the dinosaur ridge because the mountain ridge juts out narrow and straight, like the backbone of a dinosaur. Other popular destinations include the silver grass field, popular in fall; Paraeso Falls, a great place for a breather; and Gajisan Mountain\u2019s Ipseokdae Rock Columns, a rock formation resembling two hands clasped together.\nSuccessfully climbing the nine peaks in Yeongnam Alps earns one a certificate and a souvenir from the five regional governments bordering Yeongnam Alps. The certificate and the souvenir are sent out via post. 2021\u2019s souvenir is a commemorative silver coin.\nGanjeolgot Cape is located further south of Homigot Cape of Pohang, a famous destination for sunrise-watching. Visitors to Ganjeolgot Cape can catch the sunset a minute earlier than in Homigot Cape. In the winter, as the sun rises from the southwest rather than the east, Ganjeolgot Cape\u2019s sunrise precedes that of Jeongdongjin in the north by 5 min. The Somanggil Trail is named for Ganjeolgot Cape\u2019s association with a new year\u2019s wish (somang). It is 10 km long. It is divided into two sections of the Myeongseongyo Bridge and Sinamhang Port and is further divided into five thematic trails of Love, Romance, Happiness, and others. The trail passes through famous sites along the East Sea, such as Daebawi, Solgae, Songjeong seaside sarks, and Jinha and Nasa Beaches. Don\u2019t miss the gigantic postbox, a symbol of Ganjeolgot Cape; the Ganjeolgot Lighthouse, one of the 16 most beautiful lighthouses selected by the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries in 2014; and Myeongseondo Island, an island that is reachable on foot from Jinha Beach at low tide.\nGanjeolgot Cape\u2019s gigantic postbox named \u201cSomang,\u201d (wish) created in 2006, was a throwback to the old-fashioned postboxes used in Korea in the 1970s. The postbox is serviced by Korea Post, so visitors can take a free postcard on display at nearby shops and caf\u00e9s to write a letter to friends and families.\nNamchang Station of Donghae Line is the closest train station in the area. Take Bus 715, and disembark at Ganjeolgot bus stop after 30 min of traveling.\nThe first petroglyph in the world to depict whale hunting and the National Treasure No. 285 of Korea is the Petroglyphs of Bangudae Terrace in Daegok-ri, Ulju. Bangudae Terrace can only be seen with binoculars from across the river for conservation. Known by the locals for generations, the petroglyphs were revealed worldwide in 1971 by a team of researchers from Dongguk University. There are 296 separate engravings of animals whose detailed and accurate depictions have captured the interest of global academia. The most notable group of engravings is the 58 images of whales, including the northern right whale, humpback whale, right whale, gray whale, and sperm whale, which point to the history of Ulsan\u2019s whaling many thousand years ago. A life-size model of the petroglyphs is found at the Ulsan Petroglyph Museum, standing 3 m tall and 10 m across, with detailed descriptions of its value.\nThe best time to visit and see the petroglyphs in person is around 3:00 p.m. or 4:00 p.m. They are only seen clearly under specific lighting because the engravings are carved from stone without pigments or paint. It takes 20 min to reach the petroglyphs from the museum through a trail nearby, so plan your visit to get the best lighting.\nBus 348 offers the only direct connection between KTX Ulsan Station and Ulsan Petroglyph Museum. Passengers can disembark in front of the entrance after 40 min of travel.\nDonggung Palace and Wolji Pond exemplify Gyeongju\u2019s romantic atmosphere at night. Wolji Pond is a massive artificial pond with a circumference of nearly 1,000 m, built by King Munmu of Silla, the unifier of the Three Kingdoms in Korea. Historical records say that Wolji Pond was a beautiful garden home to rare birds and beasts. Donggung Palace was a palace for the Crown Prince of Silla, and Wolji Pond means \u201ca pond that reflects the moon.\u201d Its curved edges ensure that the entire pond is hidden from any point along its circumference so that it would appear as big as the sea. The pond served as the banquet hall for important events or guests for Unified Silla. Today, Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond are most popular at night when the lights in the old palace are captured in the tranquil pond nearby.\nThe Gyeongju National Museum has a gallery dedicated to Wolji Pond. When the pond was dug up for survey in 1974, a massive cache of artifacts was unearthed. Subsequent investigations excavated nearly 15,000 artifacts, which can be found nearby in Gyeongju National Museum.\nLocated 2 km away from Gyeongju Station, Jungang Line, the palace and pond are accessible to visitors on foot. Taking buses 11 or 600 from Gyeongju Station and Post Office bus stop will bring visitors to the palace within 10 min.\nBulguksa Temple and Seokguram Grotto were the first historical sites in Korea registered as UNESCO World Heritage in 1995. They remain the highlights of any visit to Gyeongju today. Both the temple and grotto are built with harmony in mind, between symmetry and asymmetry, and balance and ratio.

While most temples in Korea are located in the mountains, this temple has found its charming location along the shore line. The main sanctuary of the temple was reconstructed in 1970 with careful attention paid to the colors that were traditionally used in such structures.\nOn the right-hand side, inside the a cave, is a uniquely designed Buddhist sanctum. Other special sites at the temple are four lion statues, the 108 stairs, and stone lanterns lining the rocky landscape. Midway down the 108 steps one can pause and enjoy the calming sounds of the waves, and view the majestic sunrise.\nConsisted of houses built in staircase-fashion on the foothills of a coastal mountain, this village was originally made by war refugees for their settlement.

Shops in Gukje Market sell an assortment of new and used items. Since vendors deal in both wholesale and retail sales, the average customer can purchase various items at incredibly inexpensive prices.\nThis market represents Busan and is famous throughout the country. Visitors can buy and eat fresh raw fish right at the market. The common scene in the market is comprised of mostly elderly women selling mackerel, sea squirts and whale meat on wooden boxes along the road outside of the market and along the shore.\nAcross from Gukje Market is Bupyeong Market. It\u2019s often referred to as Kkangtong Market (kkangtong meaning \u2018cans\u2019 in Korean) since canned goods used to be the market\u2019s primary type of merchandise. Nowadays, of course, Bupyeong Market sells virtually everything from domestic to imported goods.\nBulguksa Temple is an absolute historic jewel of the Silla Capital Gyeongju, also inscribed as a UNESCO heritage of the world. It's a temple where one can discover sophisticated masonry skills of the era in the stairs, bridges, and pagodas.\nSeokguram, located in Tohamsan Mountain, is the representative stone temple of Korea. This valuable grotto has been kept intact for over 1,200 years, thanks to its design that facilitates natural ventilation and humidity control. Cold spring water was designed to flow beneath the structure, settling down any moisture that formed in the grotto towards the floor.//// Seokguram, located in Tohamsan Mountain, is the representative stone temple of Korea.

At Cheonmachong Tomb inside the complex, you can enter into the tomb itself. Its hall is consisted of a wooden coffin placed inside an underground chamber mounded with boulders and earth, characterized as a typical upper class tomb of the Silla period.\nAfter the fall of Silla, the site was abandoned and forgotten. The pond was referred to as \"Anapji\" by the later kingdoms, meaning a pond where the glory of the past is nowhere to be seen but wild geese and ducklings are found. Only in the 1980's, a pottery piece found in excavation revealed the original name of the place, \"Wolji\"(a pond that reflects the moon).\nWith its highest point located 1,708 m above ground, Seoraksan Mountain is one of the most beautiful mountains in Korea, It boasts a wide variety of colorful flowers in spring, refreshing clear water streams in summer, vibrant autumn foliages in fall, and a scenic snow-covered landscape in winter.\nThere are several hiking courses varying in distance and duration, and we will take a route of your preference.

This is considered a medical emergency that requires surgery.\nWhat causes hiatal hernias?\nIn many people with paraesophageal or hiatal hernias, the diaphragm becomes weaker as they get older. Eventually, a \u201chole\u201d develops in the muscle wall that becomes bigger over time, creating an opening for the stomach to move up into the chest.\nWho is at risk for paraesophageal and hiatal hernias?\nOlder people are most at risk for hiatal and paraesophageal hernias because the diaphragm becomes weaker with age. Other factors that may contribute to these hernias are obesity, previous pregnancy, and physical strain or trauma.\nTypically, people who develop the more serious paraesophageal hernias are older women, although men may also have them. Researchers haven\u2019t identified the reason why women are more affected than men by paraesophageal hernias.\nHow is a paraesophageal or hiatal hernia diagnosed?\nParaesophageal and hiatal hernias tend to get worse over time, making them more difficult to treat. That is why we recommend early diagnosis and treatment whenever possible.\nHow is a paraesophageal or hiatal hernia treated?\n\nIf you have a paraesophageal or hiatal hernia, surgery may help you regain control of your life again. It may also help you avoid having emergency surgery down the road if your stomach \u201ctwists\u201d and cuts off your blood supply to your stomach, which can happen in people with paraesophageal hernias. That is why doctors typically recommend surgery to treat a hernia before it becomes an emergency.\nAt UChicago Medicine, surgeons use minimally invasive procedures and robotic surgery to repair hiatal and paraesophageal hernias. After surgery, most people can go home the same day or the following day. Most patients find relief from their symptoms within a few weeks.\nWho is a candidate for paraesophageal or hiatal hernia surgery?\nWhy should I choose UChicago Medicine for paraesophageal or hiatal hernia surgery?\nOur expert surgical team performs a high volume of surgeries to treat hiatal hernias as well as serious paraesophageal hernias. Our team was also the first in the world to advance a new technique to treat paraesophageal hernias called a posterior rectus sheath flap that eliminates the need for the use of mesh.\nTraditional paraesophageal repairs typically use artificial or biological mesh to close the hole in the diaphragm. With a posterior rectus sheath flap, the surgeon uses the patient\u2019s own muscle to repair the diaphragm, so a mesh implant is not necessary. Specifically, the surgeon takes part of the muscle attached to the liver and creates a \u201cflap\u201d that helps support the diaphragm. The surgery is performed using robotic and minimally invasive surgery techniques for a quicker recovery.\nYou may be a candidate for this novel approach if you have a large paraesophageal hernia or a recurrent hiatal hernia.<|endoftext|>Being and influencer is not easy. You are trying to move people to become a better person but they may not want to be moved.\nShow them the light and wake them up. Why is what they\u2019re doing bad and what you\u2019re doing great?\nCreate a shift in their mindset and beliefs that makes them want to change. Some people hate themselves so much that they will not change for themselves but they might change for other people. Tell them how this affects them and the people around them.\nUse whatever leverage you can to make them open their eyes to a greater life.

They want the predictability of export markets over aid. The announcement on a preliminary agreement with Mexico is a critical step in the right direction.\n\"We also need to quickly finish our work on a bipartisan farm bill that contains programs that provide much-needed certainty and predictability for farmers, ranchers, growers, and other stakeholders in rural America.\"\nSen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said, \"It's important that the White House has recognized the difficult position farmers are in due to ongoing trade negotiations. This temporary relief from new tariffs will be welcomed by farmers in Iowa and throughout the country, but what they really want are long term markets, not handouts.\n\"To help corn farmers, the administration should announce its approval of E15 for year round sales. This technical correction will help farmers and lower the cost of Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) compliance for oil refineries by producing more Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) which are used to ensure biofuels are being blended into our nation's fuel supply.\n\"News today of a preliminary bilateral agreement with Mexico is encouraging, and shows that the president is working to follow through on his commitment to farmers.\"\nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall \u2014 \"The administration's tariff mitigation package is welcome relief from the battering our farmers and ranchers are taking in the ongoing trade war.\"\n\"There is no doubt that the tariffs from nations like China have led to lower crop and livestock prices. This comes on top of nearly five years of falling commodity prices that have led to lower revenues and higher debt levels for farmers and ranchers.\n\"Nationwide, income is at a 12-year low, so any assistance that may help farmers is greatly appreciated: We lost more than 150,000 farms to consolidation"

As concerns about climate change and the environment continue to grow, it's becoming more important to address how the Energy from Waste industry can help in the need to curb emissions.\nLast month, the board of Fortum Oslo Varme endorsed a proposal to realise the carbon capture plant at Klemetsrud. This is a huge milestone, as the plant will have the capability to capture as much as 90% of greenhouse gas emissions released from the incineration of waste. Plus, the heat surplus from the capture process can be used to heat the city's buildings.\nFortum Oslo Varme's carbon capture project could be one of the first full-scale plants in Europe, paving the way for other nations, and helping to get Europe on track to reach its goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\nWith this in mind, SMi Group are delighted to announce that Jannicke Gerner Bjerk\u00e5s, Director of CO2 Capture and Storage, Fortum Oslo Varme, will be speaking at this year's Energy from Waste conference to explore the challenges and opportunities in CO2 capture, and present a case study on the waste-to-energy plant at Klemetsrud.\n\"Opportunities for CO2 Capture in the Waste-to-Energy Sector case study - Fortum Oslo Varme\u2019s waste-to-energy plant at Klemetsrud\"<|endoftext|>Hi\u2026 I just wanted to find out, are pilots schedules based on where they are based(living) or they could have to take off from any airpot their airline operates from?\nAll of your trips will start and end where you are based.

The dog had a history of polyuria-polydipsia (PU/PD) and lethargy over the previous year. Physical examination was unremarkable except for a grade II systolic murmur at the apex of the heart on the left side. A 6-lead ECG was within normal limits. Arterial blood gas analysis indicated mild respiratory alkalosis (pH, 7.457, reference range, 7.370\u2013 7.450; pCO2, 29.2 mm Hg, reference range, 30.6\u2013 39.1 mm Hg; pO2, 90 mm Hg, reference range, 81\u2013105 mm Hg; HCO3, 20.9 mmol/L; reference range, 19.1\u2013 25 mmol/L). No clinically relevant abnormalities were found on CBC, serum biochemistry, serum protein electrophoresis, or hemostasis profile. Urinalysis revealed markedly reduced urine osmolality (142 mOsm/ kg; reference range, 600\u20132400 mOsm/kg), consistent with the PU/PD, reported by the owner. Both the urinary cortisol/creatinine ratio and urinary bile acid concentration were within normal limits, excluding hyperadrenocorticism and hepatic failure as underlying causes of the PU/PD. Thoracic radiographs disclosed a generalized increase in the size of the cardiac silhouette and pulmonary vascular enlargement, suggesting pulmonary overcirculation. An ELISA for Dirofilaria immitis antigen was negative. Two-dimensional, M-mode echocardiography (transducer frequency, 2.0\u20133.0 MHz) revealed left atrial enlargement, left ventricular eccentric hypertrophy, and impaired systolic function (end-diastolic dimension, 65.7 mm; end-systolic dimension, 44.2 mm; shortening fraction, 32.7%) with normal valves. Spectral and colorflow Doppler examination disclosed mild mitral, aortic, and pulmonic valve insufficiency. Both the tricuspid and the telediastolic pulmonic valvular peak regurgitant jet velocities were increased as follows: 3.26 m/s (normal, #2.5 m/s) and 2.44 m/s (normal, #2.0 m/s), respectively. According to the Bernoulli\u2019s equation modification, the systolic pulmonary artery pressure was estimated to be 42.5 mm Hg and the diastolic pulmonary artery pressure was estimated to be 23.9 mm Hg, values consistent with mild pulmonary hypertension. The dog was anesthetized and subjected to radiography of the right forelimb and total body multidetector computed tomography (MDCT). The radiographs were negative for abnormalities, and synovial fluid examination of the shoulder and stifle joints did not indicate evidence of any inflammatory pathology. MDCT scans of the brain, thorax, and abdomen were obtained. For the thoracic and abdominal scans, the dog was positioned in dorsal recumbency, and we employed the following parameters: helical modality, 120 kV, 200 mA, 0.7-second rotation tube, 0.526 pitch, and 1.2-mm slice thickness. For the brain scan, the dog was positioned in sternal recumbency and the scanner parameters were as follows: axial modality, 120 kV, 310 mA, 2-second rotation tube, 0.625 slice thickness, and 10-mm intervals. For an enhanced series, 2-mL/kg iodixanol 320 mg I/mL was injected via a 22-gauge catheter into the right cephalic vein at a 3 mL/second infusion rate, through a computed tomography injector system. The brain and abdominal MDCT scans were normal. However, MDCT of the neck and chest revealed 12 pairs of ribs, an enlarged heart, and enlarged pulmonary vessels. Both of the bronchoesophageal arteries were enlarged and connected with an enormous network of homogeneously enhancing serpentine structures involving the thoracic esophagus (esophageal and paraesophageal varices). The bronchoesophageal vein was extremely dilated (Figs 1, 2). The right azygous and hemizygous veins were normal. The cranial vena cava was dilated as was the cervical vertebral venous system, which protruded into the vertebral canal. These findings were consistent with an arteriovenous communication (single or multiple fistulas, possibly between the thoracic aorta and the azygous system) with resultant venous distension and esophageal varicosity formation. To further examine for suspected esophageal varices, we subjected the dog to an immediate videoendoscopic examination while still anesthetized. The proximal esophagus was of normal diameter and had normal mucosal features. However, numerous tortuous submucosal structures protruding into the esophageal lumen consistent with esophageal varices were encountered in the distal 3rd of the esophagus. Varix diameter ranged from 1 to 4 mm, and varices are submucosal esophageal vessels. Endoscopic criteria predictive factor for variceal bleeding include the size of esophageal varices as well as the \u2018\u2018red signs\u2019\u2019 on the mucosa overlying esophageal varices.

It is meant to show a selection of research of Arterial Blood Pressure (BP) in children and adolescents in Poland. Traditionally, Cardiologists and Nephrologists used to be particularly interested in BP since they seem to understand best the importance and need of regular BP check-ups and used arbitrary stated norms.\nHowever, epidemiological assessment of the prevalence of arterial hypertension in children and adolescents calls for an approach that is different to the one applied to adults. The Reports by American Task Force for the Control of Arterial BP in Children represent the most important and comprehensive papers in this field.\nThe first clinical articles on hypertension in children and adolescents most often would deal with secondary hypertension which can be a feature in many diseases.\nCurrently, the subject of primary and secondary hypertension in children is talked about not only at pediatric conferences or courses but also at those on adult hypertension. The increasing occurrence of hypertension in children along with other circulatory risk factors suggest the need for the continuation of various modes of research in this field.<|endoftext|>Advertisement.

I have the bottom drawer style freezer and the tall baskets are the perfect height for the bottom bin and the shorter ones are perfect for the upper pull put drawer. But the sides on both are angled so they are smaller at the bottom which wastes a lot of space when you have several of them side by side. The other issue is the mesh is too big so smaller items fall through. So, make the mesh smaller, straighten the walls and then they would be perfect. As it is I am back here now looking for something different because of these two issues.\nRated 3 out of 5 by KayeKay from Did not fit in my freezer I really liked this piece and wanted to use it to organize my freezer. It would have been a perfect fit except that the handles made it too tall. I could not find anything better to fit my space, so I bent the handles down.

It is a common practice to arrange the vectors of any minimal basis as the rows of a polynomial matrix and to call such matrix simply a minimal basis. Very recently, minimal bases, as well as the closely related pairs of dual minimal bases, have been applied to a number of problems that include the solution of general inverse eigenstructure problems for polynomial matrices, the development of new classes of linearizations and $\\ell$-ifications of polynomial matrices, and backward error analyses of complete polynomial eigenstructure problems solved via a wide class of strong linearizations. These new applications have revealed that although the algebraic properties of minimal bases are rather well understood, their robustness and the behavior of the corresponding dual minimal bases under perturbations have not yet been explored in the literature, as far as we know. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper is to study in detail when a minimal basis $M(\\lambda)$ is robust under perturbations, i.e., when all the polynomial matrices in a neighborhood of $M(\\lambda)$ are minimal bases, and, in this case, how perturbations of $M(\\lambda)$ change its dual minimal bases. In order to study such problems, a new characterization of whether or not a polynomial matrix is a minimal basis in terms of a finite number of rank conditions is introduced and, based on it, we prove that polynomial matrices are generically minimal bases with very specific properties. In addition, some applications of the results of this paper are discussed.<|endoftext|>With an impressive $30.5 million dollar debut weekend, it seems that people actually got out to see Jordan Peele\u2019s directorial debut Get Out.

The protein was originally identified through its role in converting multimers of plasmid ColE1 to monomers; only monomers are stably inherited. Here we demonstrate that XerC also has a role in the segregation of replicated chromosomes at cell division. xerC mutants form filaments with aberrant nucleotides that appear unable to partition correctly. A DNA segment (dif) from the replication terminus region of the E. coli chromosome binds XerC and acts as a substrate for XerC-mediated site-specific recombination when inserted into multicopy plasmids. This dif segment contains a region of 28 bp with sequence similarity to the crossover region of ColE1 cer. The cell division phenotype of xerC mutants is suppressed in strains deficient in homologous recombination, suggesting that the role of XerC/dif in chromosomal metabolism is to convert any chromosomal multimers (arising through homologous recombination) to monomers.\nBlakely, G., Colloms, S., May, G., Burke, M., and Sherratt, D.<|endoftext|>UGURTAS TEKSTIL INSAAT LTD.

We also describe laparoscopic mesh repair as an effective treatment option for this condition. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 National Medical Association. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\nInguinal hernia repair in infants and babies is a routine operation, but many issues have not been addressed scientifically. Thus, it is not known, e.g., if all children with a hernia should be operated on, what is the best timing of surgery, or if the operation should be performed with an open a...... approach or laparoscopically. The review is a critical discussion of these and other issues in pediatric herniorrhaphy pointing out the need for further research Udgivelsesdato: 2008/4...\nDamage control apronectomy for necrotising fasciitis and strangulated umbilical hernia.\nWe present a case of a 50-year-old morbidly obese woman who presented with a case of necrotizing fasciitis of the anterior abdominal wall due to a strangulated umbilical hernia. The case was managed through damage control surgery (DCS) with an initial surgery to stabilise the patient and a subsequent definitive operation and biological graft hernia repair. We emphasise the relevance of DCS principles in the management of severe abdominal sepsis.\nHanif, H.; Memon, S.H.\nGastric necrosis secondary to strangulated giant paraesophic hiatal hernia.\nAsymptomatic giant hiatal hernia comprises a relatively common disease, mostly presented in women with 50 years onwards. The therapeutic approach remains controversial in recent years. Under the latest SAGES`revision, all the symptomatic hernias must be repaired, but the symptomatic hiatal hernia definition isn`t even now established. We present the case os a A 67 - year old woman with an asymptomatic hiatal hernia, that is admitted to our hospital owing to toracic and abdominal pain. This pain was related with food intake for 6 months. The patient presents a clear worsening in the last 24 hours, with no other asociated symptomatology. Suspecting an incarcerated hiatal hernia with stomach perforation, the patient is taken to theatre for a laparotomy during the early hours. An atypic gastrectomy of the greater curvature with a gastropexy is performed with fixation to the anterior abdominal wall. The surgery is completed with a feeding jejunostomy. The Manegement of giant paraesophagic hernias, still remains as one of the challenge of the esophageal surgeons.\n[Hiatal hernias: why and how should they be surgically treated].\nThere is controversy in the literature about the choice of expectant medical treatment versus surgical treatment of hiatal hernias, depending on the presence or absence of symptoms.

Esophageal varices are collateral veins within the wall of the esophagus that project directly into the lumen. They are of clinical concern because they are prone to hemorrhage.\nUphill esophageal varices. Barium swallow demonstrates multiple serpiginous filling defects primarily involving the lower one third of the esophagus with striking prominence around the gastroesophageal junction. The patient had cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse.\nThe esophageal varices are also inspected for red wheals, which are dilated intraepithelial veins under tension and which carry a significant risk for bleeding (see the image below). The grading of esophageal varices and identification of red wheals by endoscopy predict a patient's bleeding risk, on which treatment is based.\nVarices can also be seen in the stomach and the duodenum (see the images below).\nIshikawa et al described chest radiographic findings in paraesophageal varices in 352 patients with portal hypertension, [27] and the most common was obliteration of a short or long segment of the descending aorta without a definitive mass shadow. Other plain radiographic findings included a posterior mediastinal mass and an apparent intraparenchymal mass. On other images, the intraparenchymal masses were confirmed to be varices in the region of the pulmonary ligament.\nOn plain radiographs, a downhill varix may be depicted as a dilated azygos vein that is out of proportion to the pulmonary vasculature. In addition, a widened superior mediastinum may be shown. A widened superior mediastinum may result from dilated collateral veins or the obstructing mass.\nEndoscopy is the criterion standard for diagnosing esophageal varices. Barium studies may be of benefit if the patient has a contraindication to endoscopy or if endoscopy is not available (see the images below). Pay attention to technique to optimize detection of esophageal varices. The procedure should be performed with the patient in the supine or slight Trendelenburg position.\nComputed tomography scan showing esophageal varices. Note the extensive collateralization within the abdomen adjacent to the spleen as a result of severe portal hypertension.\nOn nonenhanced studies, esophageal varices may not be depicted well. Only a thickened esophageal wall may be found. Paraesophageal varices may appear as enlarged lymph nodes, posterior mediastinal masses, or a collapsed hiatal hernia. On contrast-enhanced images, esophageal varices appear as homogeneously enhancing tubular or serpentine structures projecting into the lumen of the esophagus. Paraesophageal varices are easier to detect than esophageal varices because of the contrast of the surrounding lung and mediastinal fat.\nIn a retrospective investigation, Cihangiroglu et al analyzed CT scans from 21 studies of patients with SVC obstruction [31] and described as many as 15 different collateral pathways. Only 8 patients could be characterized by using the Stanford classification.\nIn the setting of SVC obstruction, the most common collateral pathways"

I think that it can be really challenging to get the right mix of proteins that can be easily attained from consuming animal products, and malnutrition can sneak up on folks who try this eating style really quickly.\nThat being said, vegan meals a few times a week can be GREAT- like a cleanse, but not in a moronic way.\nNot that cleanses aren\u2019t great\u2026.they just aren\u2019t for me.\nSo, to kick the week off, I want to show you some recipes I use on the reg that are ALREADY vegan \u2013 no adjustments necessary. Then, as the week goes on, I\u2019ll show you how to veganize some other FunnyLove favorites, and teach you some new recipes in this genre!\nBoiled Peanuts \u2013 delicious, easy, and healthy. Check the Worcestershire label, though \u2013 they make a vegan version, but not all versions are vegan!\nRosted Tomatoes \u2013 I go on and on and ON about these, and for good reason. They\u2019re delicious, easy, and VEGAN! I\u2019m actually making them on Saturday for a potluck with my bffs.\nHummus \u2013 Or edamame hummus, or sundried tomato hummus\u2026.lots of versions of this tasty snack are vegan, and they all have lots of protein and great flavor. I love the mint in the edamame version linked above.\nGrilled Tofu \u2013 tofu is a great go-to for all things vegan, and this Asian-style version is SO delicious.\nSpinach Chick Pea Curry \u2013 use veggie stock, and check your curry blend to be sure it\u2019s vegan.\nAsian-style Salad \u2013 use lots of veggies and serve rice and/or tofu on the side for a complete dinner!\nArugula-herb Salad \u2013 so delicious and simple!\nDijon Vinaigrette \u2013 I love this on salads, but it\u2019s great on slightly cooled pasta and potatoes, too!\nHomemade Vegetable Stock \u2013 great to keep on hand for use in recipes that call for chicken stock.\nBlack Bean Salsa \u2013 check the salad dressing label to be sure it\u2019s vegan \u2013 it should be!\nWhat do YOU want to learn how to make vegan? Got any favorites? Anything I should try? I\u2019m new to the vegan thing, so help a girl out, please and thank you!\nIn comments, Facebook, email, whatever\u2026.I need your help!\nWord!!!! Vegan food can be just as satisfying and tasty as any other dish. I\u2019ve recently converted (though not strict because I do have cheese from time to time) and am having a blast exploring new and exciting dishes.

There\u2019s nothing like a well-placed \u201cbut why?\u201d to draw a verbal disagreement toward tedium. And, at some point, even the strongest-willed parents will feel the urge to give up on an argument. The important part is knowing when to walk away and just how to do it.\nWalk away from little issues that are matters of opinion and personal preference.\nStick with arguments related to health, safety, and morality.\nUnderstand that it\u2019s okay to change your mind and let a child win.\nHit the pause button and come back to the argument later by summarizing both sides of the argument and taking a break to think.\nOf course, the trouble for many parents is in discerning what the \u201cbig issues\u201d are. After all, parenting has a reputation for producing acute myopia that makes it easy to confuse a need for power and control with things that need-to-happen-now-or-else. So how does a parent tell the difference between the hills they should die on and the hills they shouldn\u2019t?\nUnderstanding the difference between what parents should argue about and what they shouldn\u2019t requires that they ask themselves why they\u2019re in the argument in the first place. If they have a reason that connects to health and safety and morality, then it\u2019s important parents stand their ground. If they can\u2019t come up with a compelling reason outside of \u201cbecause I want it to be that way,\u201d then they might be on the wrong path.\nAnother reason to bail on an argument is when the argument is dragging on specifically because a parent wants to win. Darling explains it like a Buddhist koan: \u201cIf the argument is about winning the argument, you\u2019ve lost the argument,\u201d she explains.\nBut to reach a place where they can change their minds, parents may sometimes need time and space to think. A time-out for contemplation is completely reasonable with the right communication. Darling suggests that parents hit the pause button by repeating both sides of the argument back to the child for clarity and letting them know that the discussion will resume later.<|endoftext|>How much is a hotel near Cheonjiyeon Waterfall?\nIf you want to ensure you grab a bargain, try to book more than 90 days before your stay to get the best price for a Jeju City Cheonjiyeon Waterfall hotel.\nSeogwipo Kal Hotel and Ocean Palace Hotel are very popular with users who want to stay within walking distance of Cheonjiyeon Waterfall.\nKAYAK users have found double rooms near Cheonjiyeon Waterfall for as cheap as \u20b1502 in the last 3 days.

The new protagonist, Ethan Winters, and its apparent distancing from the main RE universe for much of the action, which took place within a very limited playing field, didn\u2019t sit well with everyone, but when it comes to nailing a survival-horror experience against a haunted house backdrop no one does it better.\nThe eight major title in the series, Resident Evil Village picks up from where those seemingly new beginnings left off and pushes Ethan\u2019s story even further into the metaphorical darkness. Suffice to say the poor guy\u2019s uncanny knack of walking into imminent and very bloody danger only gets worse this time around. There is a notable move away from that truly messed up Baker residence he and his wife were holed up in last time around, with the action shifting to a rural European setting, which adds a welcome Resi 4 vibe with its mix of snow-topped farmlands coated with run down shacks and creepy wooden barns, along with the developer\u2019s obvious flair for all things Victorian showcased in a huge and foreboding castle.\nWhen it comes to nailing a survival-horror experience against a haunted house backdrop no one does it better\"\nNot only does this give the game a far more open and explorative feel than its predecessor, but it also tilts the gameplay back more towards those older titles as well, with a little more action and rather less hiding in the shadows. The result is a survival experience that doesn\u2019t feel as constantly oppressive or as claustrophobic as Biohazard, and it really does feel like the best of the old and the new when Village really hits its stride.

After radiotherapy with a total dose of 20Gy for 10 fractions, she gave up further treatment and died 3 months later.\n\nDiscussion\nLNM is a key step for metastasis of CC. Previous studies revealed that the sentinel nodes were located in the pelvis, includ-   ing the area of external iliac, internal iliac, common iliac, presacral, obturator, and parametrial LNs [5,6]. The pelvic lymphatics were collected to the paraaortic lymphatic drainage chain and the cisterna chyli. The thoracic duct (TD) drains these lymphatics into the venous system at the root of the neck (usually at or near the left venous angle) [7,8]. Figure 4A shows the anterograde lymphatic drainage for CC. Therefore, LNM was identified in the pelvis and retroperitoneal regions at the beginning for this patient. Also, the retroperitoneal LNM should be near or below the cisterna chyli which is usually at or near the level of 2nd lumbar vertebra [7].\nWe found LNM in the left supraclavicular region occasionally for more advanced CC. Virchow's nodes can explain this route of metastasis [9]. As shown in Figure 4B, the left supraclavicular LNs have communications with the terminal tributaries of TD [8,10]. The retrograde lymphatic from TD can explain the left supraclavicular LNM. The terminal TD has many variations [8]. Sometimes it merges with the jugular lymph trunk and subclavian lymph trunk before emptying to the venous system. As a result, the retrograde lymphatic from TD to these trunks is also possible. LNM in the right supraclavicular region from CC is rare because of the absent of direct drainage and far retrograde lymphatic drainage from TD. There may be 3 routes, as shown in Figure 4B. First, the upward lymphatic drainage from mediastinum can reach to the bilateral supraclavicular LNs. Second, there are communications between the right and left cervical lymphatic plexus [10]. Third, hematological metastasis to the head and neck may cause LNM theoretically. For this patient, the right supraclavicular LNM were likely caused by the right upward paratracheal lymphatic drainage system according to the changes on CT images (Figure 2). Though it is uncommon, however, the TD connects to the right venous angle also exits [8].\nMediastinal LNM is uncommon for CC because the anterograde lymphatic drainage passes through the thorax by TD (Fig-ure3A). However, many researchers reported it usually at the hilar or upper mediastinal regions from CC or prostate cancer [2-4, 11, 12]. The intrathoracic lymphatic drainage for CC is complex and not well understood. There may be many routes, as shown in Figure 4C and 4D. First, at the root of TD, there are some tributaries connected to the lower mediastinal lymphatics (i.e. the pulmonary ligament lymphatic plexus) through the diaphragmatic aortic hiatus or esophageal hiatus ( Figure 4C) [13][14][15]. As a result, the retrograde mediastinal LNM is possible through these tributaries. What is more, these lymphatic plexus can relay with the intraabdominal LNs before joining to the TD [14]. This may be a major reason for the intraabdominal LNM from thoracic cancers and should explain the celiac LNM for this patient. Second, the intrathoracic tributaries of TD can communicate with thoracic organs (lung, esophagus, heat, etc.) and thoracic LNs (subcarinal LNs, paraesophageal LNs, main bronchus LNs, and paratracheal LNs, etc.) [16,17]. The insufficient valves of lateral branches of TD or the change of the liquid pressures in the TD may lead to mediastinal LNM from CC, as shown in Fiure 4D. Third, the hematological metastasis of thoracic organs (lung, pleura, thoracic wall, bone, etc.) from CC may also lead to mediastinal LNM ( Figure  4D). For our patient, the hematological metastasis was not found on CT images and MRI. Therefore, the mediastinal LNM should be caused by the former two routes. The phrenic lymphatic chain in the anterior mediastinum can also communicate with lymphatic vessels near the venous angle. This route should be another reason for retrograde LNM in the anterior mediastinum ( Figure 4B) [10].\nThe inguinal LNs usually receive lymphatic drainage from the lower limb, lower abdominal wall, groin, penile, vulvar, and anus [18,19]. Inguinal LNM can be found for CC involving the lower third of the vagina or perineum while it is uncommon for other CC [20]. Our patient had a left superficial inguinal LNM ( Figure 3B and 3C) which may be also caused by the retrograde lymphatic flow. After CRT, disorder of lymphatic drainage is common for CC.\n\nConclusions\nThe retrograde lymphatic drainage through many routes may explain these distant LNM for this patient. Though the insufficient valves of lateral branches of TD may be a reason for the retrograde lymphatic drainage, they were uncommon. For this patient with extensive distant LNM, many other reasons should be considered. For example, the blockage and compression of the lymphatic vessels or TD may lead to retrograde lymphatic drainage because of the change of fluid pressure. Additionally, the anatomy of the lymphatics is complex and variable among people.

        "passage": " skin through a small incision in the left anterior abdominal wall [ Figure 1I].\n\nThoracic portion of the procedure and anastomotic development\nAfter completion of the abdominal phase, the patient is reintubated with a double lumen endotracheal tube and placed in the left lateral decubitus position. Single lung ventilation is established in the left lung. Four robotic ports are used to facilitate thoracic mobilization of the esophagus in addition to a fifth valveless insufflation assistant port [ Figure 2A]. Three robotic ports are placed in the eighth intercostal space starting anterior to the anterior axillary line (12 mm), posterior axillary line (8 mm), and posteriorly approximately 2 cm away from the spine (8 mm). An 8 mm robotic port is placed in the third or fourth intercostal space anteriorly to allow for upper esophageal mobilization. An assistant 12 mm valveless insufflation port is placed low in the pleural cavity at about the tenth intercostal space at the level of the diaphragm. The chest is typically insufflated with carbon dioxide to a pressure of 8-10 mmHg.\nUsing a curved bipolar instrument, circumferential esophageal mobilization is performed starting from the level of the hiatus, proceeding superiorly to the level of the azygos vein. Starting at the inferior pulmonary ligament [ Figure 2B], all paraesophageal lymphoid tissue is either removed serially during the dissection or included with the surgical specimen. Any subcarinal nodal tissue is also dissected; the bronchus intermedius is typically skeletonized in the process [ Figure 2C]. The abdominal Penrose drain is retrieved and pulled into the chest, ensuring circumferential dissection of the esophagus [ Figure 2D]. After mobilization of the esophagus towards the thoracic inlet, the azygos vein is divided near the superior vena cava (SVC) using a white vascular load curved tip robotic stapler [ Figure 2E].\nOnce esophageal dissection is completed, the esophagus is divided approximately 2-3 cm superior to the azygos vein [ Figure 2F] and the gastric conduit is pulled into the chest [ Figure 2G]. The proximal esophageal margin is sent for frozen section analysis to ensure that it is negative for metaplasia, dysplasia, or malignancy [ Figure 2H]. A 28 mm end-to-end anastomotic (EEA) stapler anvil is inserted into the proximal esophagus after removing any staples placed during transection. Running 3-0 vicryl (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) \"baseball stitch\" sutures are positioned around the esophageal edge to secure the anvil in the proximal esophagus. An additional reinforcing purse string suture may be employed to assure mucosal apposition around the stem of the anvil during deployment of the stapler. Alternatively, a transoral anvil (OrVil TM, Medtronic, Mansfield, Massachusetts) may be passed through the proximal esophageal staple line [ Figure 2I]. The posterior axillary line port is extended into a 4-5 cm access incision to facilitate completion of the anastomosis (either intracorporeal or extracorporeal; in our case, extracorporeal anastomosis was performed). Using a soft tissue Alexis retractor, this incision can be opened further. A gastrotomy is then created in the proximal conduit tip, and the EEA stapler is introduced through it. Once in appropriate position to engage with the anvil without excessive redundancy in the conduit, the stapler spike is brought out of the greater curvature of the conduit at or below the transition stitch. After appropriate alignment, the stapler is docked onto the anvil and fired, creating the anastomosis. Two mucosal \"rings\", one esophageal and one gastric, are confirmed in the EEA stapler once it is removed from the thoracic cavity.\nA nasogastric tube is carefully advanced beyond the anastomosis and the gastrotomy site is resected using an endoscopic gastrointestinal anastomosis (GIA) stapler. After creation of the anastomosis, a soft tissue drain is placed adjacent to the conduit, and a chest tube is placed in the pleural cavity, prior to re-inflating the right lung under direct visualization and closure.\nOf note, the esophagogastric anastomosis can be performed in any of several different manners, including a linear side-to-side (functional end-to-end) stapled or a completely sewn 2-layer technique. No particular method has proven superior in terms of anastomotic leakage, though stapled anastomoses appear to lead to fewer strictures than ones that are completely sewn [19,20].\n\nPatient positioning and port placement\nMcKeown RAMIE is started with esophageal dissection in the chest. A double lumen endotracheal tube is placed and the patient is rotated to the left lateral decubitus position. The lung is isolated and four robotic ports are used for esophageal mobilization with or without an assistant port, similar to the thoracic phase (c) camera port; (a) assistant port]; dissection in the chest typically begins with division of the inferior pulmonary ligament (B) followed by circumferential dissection of the esophagus (C) to allow placement of a Penrose drain around it (D); if performing the operation for an esophageal malignancy, nodal tissue is swept up with the specimen; the airway will be visualized during the dissection (BI). The azygos vein is divided flush with the cava (E) and the esophagus is transected superior to the azygos (F); the gastric conduit is delivered into the chest (G); and the proximal esophageal margin is checked in malignant cases (H); a transoral anvil is then delivered through the esophageal staple line (I) and an end-to-end anastomotic stapler used to complete the anastomosis, performed extra-corporeally here (images not captured). BI: bronchus intermedius of an Ivor Lewis esophagectomy [ Figure 3A]. Three robotic ports are placed in the eighth intercostal space -one anterior to the anterior axillary line (12 mm), another at the posterior axillary line (8 mm), and another (8 mm) posteriorly approximately 2 cm from the spine. An 8 mm robotic port is placed in the third or fourth intercostal space anteriorly to facilitate upper esophageal mobilization. An assistant 12 mm valveless insufflation port is placed low in the pleural cavity at approximately the tenth intercostal space and the chest is insufflated to a pressure of 8-10 mmHg.\n\nThoracic portion of the procedure\nDissection starts at the inferior pulmonary ligament and proceeds posteriorly along the esophagus [ Figure 3B]. The esophagus is dissected circumferentially along with para-esophageal lymphoid tissue. A Penrose drain is placed circumferentially around the esophagus to aid superior and inferior mobilization [ Figure 3C]. The airway is skeletonized in the process [ Figure 3D]. Care must be taken not to injure the thoracic duct; if there is doubt, the duct should be clipped or ligated. The azygos vein is divided near the SVC using a curved tip vascular load placed through the anterior port [ Figure 3E]. The previously placed Penrose drain is positioned in the apex of the chest for retrieval from the neck [ Figure 3F and G]. A second Penrose drain can be placed at the level of the diaphragm for later retrieval from the abdomen [ Figure 3H]. After ensuring adequate hemostasis, a chest tube is placed though the anterior incision and advanced to the apex [ Figure 3I]. The lung is then re-inflated under direct visualization before closing the incisions. the robot is docked, dissection begins at the inferior pulmonary ligament (B); as the dissection is carried en bloc superiorly, a Penrose drain is placed around the esophagus (C) to aid in retraction. The airway is visualized during skeletonization for cases of malignancy (D; BI); the azygos vein (E) is divided, and dissection is carried up to the apex with creation of a pleural tent (F, red arrow pointing towards the mobilized esophagus). One Penrose drain is tucked at the apex (G) while another is tucked at the diaphragm (H) prior to closing the chest (I). BI: bronchus intermedius\n\nAbdominal dissection\nThe patient is positioned supine and the double lumen endotracheal tube is switched to a single lumen tube. The patient's neck is extended and turned slightly to the right, exposing the left lower anterior neck. The neck, anterior chest, and abdomen are prepped and draped in routine sterile fashion. The abdominal ports are placed as for an Ivor Lewis RAMIE [ Figure 4A]. Four robotic ports (one 12 mm and three 8 mm) are typically employed; a 12 mm right upper quadrant port is needed to create a gastric conduit with the use of a robotic stapler.\nThe abdomen is entered with either a Hassan or Optiview technique with a 0-degree, 5 mm camera in the left upper quadrant. This port is later converted to an 8 mm robotic port. Once in the peritoneum, the abdomen is insufflated with carbon dioxide to a pressure of 15 mmHg. Three additional robotic ports (one 8 mm midline, one 8 mm left lateral quadrant, and one 12 mm right upper quadrant) are placed under direct visualization. These ports are placed equidistant from the xiphoid process. A 5 mm liver retractor port can be employed either laterally in the right upper quadrant or near the subxiphoid process. Finally, an assistant 12 mm valveless port is placed low in the pelvis typically on the patient's right side, in order to facilitate placement of a feeding jejunostomy in the left lower quadrant.\nThe dissection is started with creation of the gastric conduit. The gastrocolic ligament is divided along the greater curvature of the stomach with a robotic vessel sealer while preserving the right gastroepiploic arterial arcade [ Figure 4B"

        "passage": " less than 50% of cases [17]. pH testing is not essential in the diagnosis of a hiatal hernia, but it has proven helpful in providing a quantitative analysis of reflux episodes as it correlates pH level with the patient's complaints of reflux [1]. In Duranceau et al's study, it is considered the gold standard to document acid reflux exposure in the esophageal lumen [16].\nComputer tomography (CT) is not routinely recommended, but remains useful in conferring additional information on location and type of hiatal hernia. Usually, it is discovered incidentally while performing CT scan for a different indication [5]. Dallemagne et al. recommend CT scan in order to rule out complications like perforation, pneumoperitoneum or pneumomediastinum [17]. In case of paraesophageal hernia, it is a helpful method in the assessment of gastric volvulus [5].\nOleynikov et al., Duranceau et al. and Andolfi et al. have found that for a preoperative evaluation of a patient, barium swallow X-ray, upper endoscopy and manometry are essential [1,13,16]. Moreover, Weitzendorfer et al consider that in order to have a reliable exclusion of hiatal hernia prior to treatment, all three investigations must be performed [19].\n\nMedical appproach\nWhen confronted with a symptomatic hiatal hernia, it is usually due to acid reflux. Therefore, the aim is to reduce the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) by addressing gastric acid secretion. Lifestyle modifications are the first line of management and include the following: weight loss, elevating the head of the bed by 8 inches during sleep, avoidance of meals 2-3 hours before bedtime, elimination of \"trigger\" foods such as chocolate, alcohol, caffeine, spicy foods, citrus, carbonated drinks [20,21]. According to the American College of Gastroenterology, an 8-week course of PPI is the therapy of choice for symptom relief in GERD, with no major differences in the efficacy between the different types of PPIs [22]. Twice-daily PPI therapy can be recommended for patients with an inadequate symptom response to once-daily PPI [20]. The current recommendation is to use the minimal dose of PPI that is sufficient to control symptoms [5]. Other alternatives include histamine 2 receptor antagonists and antacids. Patients presenting with moderate symptoms can use these treatments on demand, while those with persistent symptoms despite PPI treatment should use them as an add-on treatment.\nAs for paraesophageal hernias, they are a different matter at hand: the gastric fundus has migrated above the diaphragm and, therefore, they are at a high risk of obstruction. Most of the patients that develop symptoms from paraesophageal hernia will experience little or no relief with medication such as proton pump inhibitors, histamine receptor antagonists or antacids [1]. It is helpful to take such medication, as it eases the symptoms, but the definitive treatment for paraesophageal hernia remains surgery.\nProkinetic drugs are not recommended in guidelines neither as monotherapy nor as add-on treatment as there is no evidence supporting their efficacy in the treatment of hiatal hernia associated with GERD [20,23].\n\nSurgical appproach\nThe current guideline for the surgical treatment of hiatal hernia was elaborated by the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) in the year 2013. Through our literature research we have found that indications for surgery remain the same: symptomatic patients with paraesophageal hernia [1,17,24], especially those with obstructive symptoms and gastric volvulus, which require urgent surgery [21]. When sliding hernia and symptoms of GERD are present, surgical approach might be considered, especially in cases where regurgitation persists despite medical treatment with PPI [5]. However, Andolfi et al. have suggested in their study that even asymptomatic patients younger than 50 should be considered for surgery [13,25]. Recently, a study performed by Straatman et al. has taken into account octogenarians and their indication for surgical repair. The conclusion was that elective repair in symptomatic patients should be the preferred approach in the octogenarian group [26] (Table II).\nThe SAGES Guidelines strongly recommend not repairing type I hiatal hernia in the absence of reflux disease and symptoms; this recommendation remains valid to this day, as sustained by several authors [5,15]. These guidelines also recommend performing hiatal hernia repair combined with other types of bariatric surgery, such as sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass. Recently, Mahawar et al. have performed a study that found sleeve gastrectomy to be the best bariatric option for obese patients with HH and/or GERD. They have also demonstrated that sleeve gastrectomy and hiatal hernia repair can safely be performed simultaneously [27]. With regards to the technical approach, hiatal hernia can be repaired either transabdominally or via a transthoracic approach, usually through the left chest. The current standard procedure is laparoscopic fundoplication for both sliding and paraesophageal hernia [28]. Usually, a Nissen fundoplication (360\u00b0) is performed after most hiatal hernia repairs, unless there is a preexisting esophageal dysmotility, in which case the Toupet fundoplication (270\u00b0) is preferred [15]. There has been recent evidence that a complete fundoplication might be more beneficial as it has a reduced abnormality in the pH profile and a stronger impact [3]. Laparoscopic surgery provides the advantages of a minimally invasive approach, which consist of: shorter hospital stays, faster time of recovery, reduced post-operative pain and reduced pulmonary complications [1,28]. There are, of course, certain disadvantages of laparoscopic surgery which include two-dimensional imaging, limited motion of laparoscopic instruments and poor ergonomics for surgeons [28].\nThe technical considerations have remained mostly the same, however, new data has been brought to light regarding the use of mesh during paraesophageal hernia repair. The current position of the SAGES Gudelines regarding this topic is uncertain; there is inadequate data on the long-term to formulate a recommendation either for or against the use of mesh repair [2]. Although controversy still revolves around paraesophageal hernia repair, the general opinion seems to favor the use of mesh reinforcement. Zaman et al. have found a decrease in recurrence after laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair and mesh reinforcement, with similar results in both syntethic and biologic mesh [24]. Regarding the use of synthetic mesh, concerns have arisen as it has been associated with the development of esophageal erosion, stricture, dysphagia, obstruction and esophageal stenosis [3,24,29]. Zhang et al., Huddy et al. and Tam et al. have all found a reduced rate of hernia recurrence after mesh reinforcement compared to primary suture repair at shortterm follow-up (up to 12 months) [30,31,32]. Moreover, Oelschlager et al have demonstrated that a lower recurrence rate is associated with short-term follow-up for biologic mesh reinforcement, while with long-term follow-up the benefit is lost [33]. As a result, the short-term benefit may justify the use of biologic mesh among surgeons, but, more studies will be needed in order to establish a clear recommendation as a guideline.\nOne topic that is not mentioned at all in the 2013 SAGES Guidelines is represented by the role of robotic surgery in hiatal hernia repair. The development of the DaVinci telemanipulation system might overcome some of the limitations of standard laparoscopic approach by providing increased visualization through three-dimensional and stereoscopic vision and optimized ergonomics [28,34]. Vasudevan et al. have found in their study that the robotic approach to paraesophageal repair is effective and safe, with low complication rates, even in patients of older age and risk of complications [28]. However, Gehrig et al.\nconcluded that there is no significant advantage of the DaVinci system over the conventional laparoscopic technique [35]. Their study found no significant difference regarding the operating time, intraoperative and postoperative complications and hospital stay between the robotic assisted surgery group and the laparoscopic surgery group. Moreover, the issue of cost remains an important drawback related to robotic surgery. General recommendations cannot be made yet regarding this field, as there are no large randomized trials comparing efficacy, outcomes and cost effectiveness of both robotic and laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repairs.\n\nConclusions\nUpdates on the current guidelines of hiatal hernia management have yet to be made, as additional studies regarding long-term follow-up and stratified subsets of patients need to be designed. However, until these are available, whether mesh reinforcement and robotic approach can be used remains at the surgeon's discretion.<|endoftext|>Jenn Valerio joined us in 2019 as an assistant teacher in our Pre-Kindergarten Program.

Most hiatal hernias are asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally, but rarely, a life-threatening complication may present acutely. The image below depicts a paraesophageal hiatal hernia.\nA paraesophageal hernia is seen on an upper gastrointestinal series. Note that the gastroesophageal junction remains below the diaphragm. Courtesy of David Y. Graham, MD.\nMost people with hiatal hernias are asymptomatic. In a minority of individuals, hiatal hernias may predispose to reflux or worsen existing reflux.\nDiaphragmatic hernias may be congenital or acquired. Acquired hiatal hernias are divided further into nontraumatic (more common) and traumatic hernias. Nontraumatically acquired hernias are divided yet further into 2 types: (1) sliding hiatal hernia and (2) paraesophageal hiatal hernia (a mixed variety is also possible).\nThe typical reason for evaluation is the presence of symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or a chest radiograph suggesting a paraesophageal hernia.\nA barium study also helps distinguish a sliding from a paraesophageal hernia.\nA hiatal hernia occurs when a portion of the stomach prolapses through the diaphragmatic esophageal hiatus. Although the existence of hiatal hernia has been described in earlier medical literature, it has come under scrutiny only in the last century or so because of its association with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its complications. There is also an association between obesity and the presence of hiatal hernia. By far, most hiatal hernias are asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally. On rare occasion, a life-threatening complication, such as gastric volvulus or strangulation, may present acutely.\nThe lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is an area of smooth muscle approximately 2.5-4.5 cm in length. The upper part of the sphincter normally lies within the diaphragmatic hiatus, while the lower section normally is intra-abdominal. At this level, the visceral peritoneum and the phrenoesophageal ligament cover the esophagus. The phrenoesophageal ligament is a fibrous layer of connective tissue arising from the crura, and it maintains the LES within the abdominal cavity. The A-ring is an indentation sometimes seen on barium studies, and it marks the upper part of the LES. Just below this is a slightly dilated part of the esophagus, forming the vestibule. A second ring, the B-ring, may be seen just distal to the vestibule, and it approximates the Z-line or squamocolumnar junction. The presence of a B-ring confirms the diagnosis of a hiatal hernia. Occasionally, the B-ring also is called the Schatzki ring.\nAny sudden increase in intra-abdominal pressure also acts on the portion of the LES below the diaphragm to increase the sphincter pressure. An acute angle, the angle of His, is formed between the cardia of the stomach and the distal esophagus and functions as a flap at the gastroesophageal junction and helps prevent reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus (see the image below).\nHiatal hernia. Figure 1 shows the normal relationship of the gastroesophageal junction, stomach, esophagus, and diaphragm. Figure 2 shows a sliding hiatal hernia where the stomach immediately below the gastroesophageal junction is seen to prolapse through the diaphragmatic hiatus into the chest. Figure 3 shows a paraesophageal hernia in which the cardia or fundus of the stomach prolapses through the diaphragmatic hiatus, leaving the gastroesophageal junction within the esophageal cavity.\nThe gastroesophageal junction acts as a barrier to prevent reflux of contents from the stomach into the esophagus by a combination of mechanisms forming the antireflux barrier. The components of this barrier include the diaphragmatic crura, the LES baseline pressure and intra-abdominal segment, and the angle of His. The presence of a hiatal hernia compromises this reflux barrier not only in terms of reduced LES pressure but also reduced esophageal acid clearance. Patients with hiatal hernias also have longer transient LES relaxation episodes particularly at night time. These factors increase the esophageal mucosa acid contact time predisposing to esophagitis and related complications.\nHiatal hernias are more common in Western countries. The frequency of hiatus hernia increases with age, from 10% in patients younger than 40 years to 70% in patients older than 70 years.\nSihvo et al examined the mortality associated with adult paraesophageal hernia in a Finnish retrospective, population-based study.  Five hundred sixty-three patients received surgical intervention and 67 received conservative treatment for paraesophageal hernia. Death occurred in 32 patients, of whom 29 had concomitant diseases.\nIn a Swiss study, Larusson et al investigated the predictive factors for postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing laparoscopic hernia repair.  Of 354 laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repairs, age at 70 years or older was significantly associated with postoperative morbidity (24.4%) and mortality (2.4%) relative to those younger than 70 years (10.1% postoperative morbidity, P = 0.001; 0% mortality, P = 0.045). Similar age findings were noted with gastropexy but not with fundoplication.  In addition, high-risk patients had significantly higher morbidity but not mortality.\nHiatal hernias are more common in women than in men. This might relate to the intra-abdominal forces exerted in pregnancy.\nMuscle weakening and loss of elasticity as people age is thought to predispose to hiatus hernia, based on the increasing prevalence in older people. With decreasing tissue elasticity, the gastric cardia may not return to its normal position below the diaphragmatic hiatus following a normal swallow. Loss of muscle tone around the diaphragmatic opening also may make it more patulous.\nPolomsky M, Peters JH, Schwartz SI. Hiatal hernia and disorders of the spine: a historical perspective.

The instrument can be used both for sounding and assessment purposes. It turns out that nearly all students can integrate theory and practice in a natural way through gaining so-called theory-enriched practical knowledge. This takes place in an adequately equipped multimedia learning environment that is focused on integrating theory and practice. In such a situation, students mainly use theory to analyse practice or to respond to practical situations. There are however significant differences, that are among other things expressed in the relation between nature and level of theory use and the variables study year, prior education and numeracy of students. Rises in level of theory use by students turn out to occur mostly during interaction that is led by the teacher educator. Among other things, the results of the study point towards the need for extra pedagogical measures for those students with'mbo-zonder wiskunde'(senior secondary vocational education without mathematics) as their prior education, as well as for student teachers with prior education 'vwo with mathematics' (pre-university education with mathematics).<|endoftext|>We can provide a variety of services and advanced web features.

I thought it would be difficult having both Rachel and MIL too. Maybe Rachel felt threatened by the attention you were giving MIL. So she played up?\nDee good luck in the relocation and please drive carefully.\nI am feeling a bit better today although my head is still sore from all the couching and blowing.\nThank God I do not have to work today as it wil give me some more recovery time.\nWow I go to Washington DC for one week and you all explode with life. Some good some not so good.\nDC was awful! I hated the people, the traffic the walking the mother in law. Ok I don't hate her but she wasn't a whole lot of help.  Rachel is very clingy and I didn't get a break the entire week. I was so glad to go home last Friday I cannot tell you how glad.\nI am work today and overwhelmed but I took a moment after my lunch to read all your posts and try and catch up.\nGeorgia I hope you are feeling better and your curves is going well.\nJenny - welcome welcome and believe me I could use one of those mom breaks with my Rachel.\nJeanine can you come to Ohio now and do my floors!\nDee sounds like moving and packing is the pitts hang in there.\nCynni welcome and I too love animals especially cats.

I will pray for ya.\nOk all I gotta go take care.\nCathy, I don't pray but my thoughts are with you. I hope he pulls trough. Take care of your loved ones.\nI haven't been on a lot as I have been dealing with a crisis in my birth family. My brother who is 51 is very sick and probably won't make it. We were close as kids, but then my brother married, my sister in law wasn't always very nice to me and pretty much controlled the relationship between me and my brother. I haven't had a lot of contact with him in the past several years. I have tried so hard to connect and just make amends, but I can't make people want to be a part of my life.\nMy brother Jeff had surgery this past Monday which was very dangerous but necessary. He had the worst case scenario Paraesophageal hernia. His organs were all in the wrong place and he needed surgery, but on the day he went home he ruptured the staples due to a bubble in his stomach, and the acids made his toxic. They took him back into emergency surgery last night and he got through it. But there is very little to no response. The neurologist will come today and let us know if there is any brain activity. If there isn't we will wait for my sister in law to make the decision to pull life support. They tried to remove the ventilator this morning and he couldn't breathe on his own. My parents will come in from out of town tonight and that is when the decision will be made. I am beside myself. I am broken.\nPlease pray for my brother and for me. I am so sorry I haven't been on and miss you all. I will be back, but need to take care of me and my family right now. I know you understand. Due to a lack of time I have posted this to my three teams so everyone is aware.\nCynni, I don't play the Final Fantasy games but my ds and dd do. My ds (son) picked out Fang for me for another team I am on. I will have to Google your city as Georgia did, it sounds like a really interesting place to live.\nGeorgia, I am glad you are feeling better and got your gardening done.\nMe..I am leaving early on Tuesday to drive to Georgia to help move my dh from one apt to another. Will be back very late on Saturday. I will try and check in when I can. Hope you all have a GREAT WEEK!\nI am feeling so much better this afternoon. I did my gardening and spent the rest of the day lying sown and resting.\nGeorgia: Nijmegen is actually the oldest city in the Netherlands. It was the first town to have city rights. That is why it is so old. In the city center are also remains from buildings that were destroyed during the 2nd WW. So the city is full of history.\nCynni i had a look at your home town on google and it is a very old place. I would love to photograph the castles and old structures. How wonderful.\nDee how disappointing that there are no takers yet. How frustrating for you. I am praying for some one to fall in love with the place.\nI am going to do gardening today. Runny nose and all. If I don't get it done now I never will as my next day off is next Sunday.\nThe Netherlands is located in Europe. It is a small country.\n I recognize Fang from your user picture.\nCynni, You live in the Netherlands. I have heard of it but don't know too much about it. I live in the U.S. in the state of Indiana right now but will be moving shortly to the state of Georgia.\nYour cats sound beautiful, love the names. I have the \"Walk It Out\" game for the Wii and I love playing it. I hope you will too. My black cat is named Rose and our calico that passed was called Shana. My kids named them after characters in the Legend of Dragoon game they have.\nGeorgia, so glad you will have a few days to get better before returning to work. Haven't heard any feedback at all from the last two showings on the house. So far no takers or offers. I think folks are just out looking to see what type of deals they can get. Sure makes it frustrating, especially having to keep the house spotless and decluttered in case someone calls to come see it.\nCathy, Amanda, Jennifer, Amy, Andi, Jenny, How ya all doing?

When applied to the cheeks or cheekbones (This depends on your skin tone), it blends out into a beautiful plum shade that works out as a blush.Because of its consistency, it gives the cheeks a glow. Another fantastic thing about this product is that it\u2019s multi-functional! You can also use it on the eyes AND lips.\nThe Inner Glow Cr\u00e9me Pigment in Eclipse retails at USD29 and is currently on pre-order and it will launch on 5th April on Rituel De Fille\u2019s website.\nIf black highlighter is something you\u2019re thinking of trying, Jeffree Star Cosmetics also has a black highlighter. Unlike Rituel De Fille\u2019s black highlighter, Jeffree Star\u2019s Onyx Skin Frost\u2122 comes in a pressed powder form, and it\u2019s shimmery.\nJust like Rituel De Fille\u2019s Eclipse, it can be used on the eyes, cheeks and lips as well (If you mix it with a mixing medium). This highlighter also retails at USD29 is available online.\nNot how well such a shade would work on Asian skintones, but hey, at least if you\u2019re feeling moody on a particular day, you know that there\u2019s a product for it!<|endoftext|>DiCaprio as Anakin, Ralph Fiennes or Russel Crowe as Obi Wan?\nDiscussion in 'Star Wars: Episodes I - III' started by BadrHari, Sep 17, 2015.\nNot sure if this was Lucas' first choice or just the concept artist's dream"

Due to the elaborately hand-carved flourishes on the windows and the roof battens, the house stands princely on its property. Build in the early 1900s expands a total living area of 306m. Which is estimated together from a basement of 38m, a floor of 148m and an attic of 120m.\nThe Modeling Process began early with the scanning of the Building to generate a point cloud as output. This Point Cloud can be used with its millimeter accuracy as the basis to remodel the building in all its detail.\nA so-called digital twin is created which contains every detail one-to-one like the existing, standing building. Once this true-to-life digital twin is finished, the modeling phase is complete and the designer can begin his work. However, the modeling phase is only one of the 4 phases that the project will go through here at Raymond and Partners.\nThe following phases are described one by one further down the page.<|endoftext|>Fly a Boeing B-737 flight simulator at the Air Force Center D\u00fcbendorf.

My RBC and H&H normal, but anisocytosis+1 was there; never have seen this blood test result before. Never heard of it. Rheumatologist did not comment, and I did not see it until I left his office. May be a side effect of prednisone or methotrexate which I stopped after the blood draw on his advice and hematologist's advice.\nMeans RBC are not evenly sized. And may herald iron deficiency anemia..or some underlying disorder more ominous. Anisocytosis+2 is more toublesome than +1 so I guess, I am lucky. On a prior test months ago, my ferritin was low. Anyone familiar with this test and its significance?\nMonday, I see my GP, so will bring it up with him. I have seen a hematologist in consult, who happens to be a very sweet person, so I do have a hematologist on board.\nI do feel weak.....it may also be related to paraesophageal hiatal hernia I have read somewhere.\nAlways in back of mind : 1 grandmother with PMR/GCA and 1 grandmother with leukemia in old age; grandmom with PMR recovered, got off Prednisone and lived until 92; other grandmother died a year or so after diagnosis at 73 ;of course, 45 years ago there wasn't the sophistication of treatment, and she opted to go home on morphine.\nHopefully, neither will apply too soon, but wondered if anisocytosis is familiar to any of you.\nIt may be a lab anomaly too. Are you on any other drugs? Methotrexate for example?\nYes; at the time of blood draw, was on 15mg. once a week. Have stopped on advice of a new rheumatologist and a hematologist. Maybe it will not show up next blood test?\nThanks; read ; see GP Monday and will ask for follow up blood work. Also have a large paraesophageal hiatal hernia compressing left lower lung; have for sometime felt oxygen level not quite sufficient ; surgery usually not recommended for hernias b/c of high complication rates; don't know if impairing a lung; stated atelectasis on scan left lower lobe.

The work was conducted between June and September 2012. The project required the seam to be sampled on a ply-by-ply basis for the purpose of thorough coal quality analysis. This meant that each of the target plies had to be sampled and stored separately and in a way that would eliminate the chance of contamination from each other or non-target material. The samples would also need to be collected and deployed to the laboratory for analysis relatively quickly, which meant that minimising downtime, maintaining a window to conduct the required work and establishing communication between the surface and underground was of the utmost importance. The channel sampling project took place in the cut-throughs of Maingate 7 North (MG7N) which will become the tailgate of Longwall 8 North (LW8N).\nThe GM seam is split into 6 plies defined by penny bands (mudstone layers within the coal seam) and was collected in two separate ways depending on the type of analysis and testing required. Type A \u2013 LTCC testing, is shown in Figure 1, and Type B \u2013 CSR testing, is shown in Figure 2. The samples in the cut-throughs of 7N were obtained from the ribs within the 3.4m roadway. The use of an air chainsaw was used to remove the rib and access the coal a certain distance into the rib, in order to reduce any contamination effects. As the average seam thickness is 6.4m, a scorpion air-track was used to core the roof and collect samples from the plies outside of the roadway. The airtrack used NMLC (52mm) split coring barrels to obtain enough coal to complete the sampling process. For each sample collected a minimum of 60kg of coal was required.\nThe initial planning phase required a Risk Assessment to be undertaken. Once this was completed the required tools and equipment for the job were located and prepared for use underground. These included an"

The effects of electron spin are vastly stronger than the effects of nuclear spin, so we will ignore that for the moment (though nuclear spin is essential for the performance of MRI and NMR instruments).\nElectrons can either be \"spin up\" or \"spin down.\" This has nothing to do with up and down, and could just as easily be left and right, or blue and red, but by convention they are up and down. Materials in which there are exactly as many spin up electrons as spin down electrons are called \"diamagnetic,\" and are very weakly repelled by magnetic fields. Materials that have an imbalance in the number of spin up and spin down electrons are called \"paramagnetic,\" have a net magnetic moment, and can interact with magnetic fields in much more interesting ways. Now things get tricky... there are several different ways that paramagnetic materials can be, depending on how the electrons interact with each other: ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic are the most common types, but there are other more exotic types of magnetism, especially when one starts considering rare earth elements, for which electrons can also have significant angular momentum about the nucleus, but I digress... Typical permanent magnets are ferromagnetic, which essentially means that all of the electrons align in such a way that the magnet has poles (this is a significant oversimplification, but perhaps a good starting point).\nThere are also electromagnets, which don't rely on the spin of electrons, but rather on the overall macroscopic motion of electrons.\nMost magnetism has to do with the \"spin\" of subatomic particles.\nMy thoughts also...\nAs a graduate lecturer and overall science peep for too many years, your answer was a reflection of my thoughts..Particularly the (electron) spin component with a dab of good ole' E-D-Haas angular momentum effect for fun.\nI hope this Q has not been asked repeatedly, for I did not do a lot of digging...<|endoftext|>Once diagnosed, UDS should be surgically addressed by reduction of the migrated stomach, excision of hernia sac, and hiatal defect closure combined with an anti-reflux procedure as 360\u00b0 or partial fundoplication. Laparoscopic repair provides benefits as reduced postoperative morbidity and hospital stay. Even if asymptomatic a surgical intervention is indicated as a conservative approach bears the risk of a high mortality rate due to complications which is significantly reduced by elective surgery.[1,2,4,5,11] In the light of only few series and cases reported, there is no clear evidence from review of the current literature for the management of acute paraesophageal hernia or UDS as very rare conditions.[13] In addition, there is an ongoing controversial discussion about whether prothetic reinforcement of the hiatus by mesh insertion is reasonable and effective. In the face of high recurrence rates several surgeons recommend the use of prosthetic meshes. However, many severe complications can be associated with mesh implantation as perforation necessitating partial esophagogastrectomy or acute erosive bleeding of the abdominal aorta.[14] In summary, there is still a considerable controversy regarding the routine mesh insertion and the quality of evidence is very low.<|endoftext|>ATRT-03 S2 | Vanguard Instruments Company, Inc.\nThe Vanguard Instruments ATRT-03 S2 is the third generation, microprocessor-based, automatic, three phase, transformer turns-ratio tester. This light weight, rugged, portable unit is designed for transformer testing at utility power substations.\nThe ATRT-03 S2 determines the transformer turns ratio using the IEEE C57.12.90 measurement method. The ATRT-03 S2 outputs an excitation test voltage to the transformer primary windings. The induced secondary voltage is sensed and the transformer turns ratio is calculated. The ATRT-03 S2 is capable of measuring turns ratios from 0.8 to 15,000. The transformer turns-ratio, excitation current, and phase angle readings are displayed on the large LCD. The automatic transformer type detection feature allows the ATRT-03 S2 to detect and test 130 transformer types defined by ANSI, CEI/IEC and Australian standards.<|endoftext|>Hitachi fell into deep red during fiscal 2006, posting a net loss of 32.8bn yen ($271.6m), compared with a profit of 37.32bn yen ($309m) a year earlier.\nJapan's biggest electronics conglom attributes the money dive to the cost of nuclear reactor turbine repairs and the poor performance of its hard drive and flat panel TV operations.\n\"We are not raising a flag of surrender,\" Hitachi CEO Nakamura said in a press conference. \"We haven't given up on returning these businesses to profitability. We are not considering withdrawing from these businesses.\"\nCompany coffers felt the squeeze from a 70bn yen ($579m) bill to repair faulty turbines at nuclear plants operated by Chubu Electric Power and Hokuriku Electric Power and from the construction of a thermal power plant in the US.\nHitachi said its electronics media division suffered from sinking prices in the market, resulting in an operating loss of 58.4bn yen ($483.5m), down from a loss of 35.7bn yen ($295.6m) a year earlier.\nThe HDD division had an operating loss of 43.7bn yen ($361m), wider than the previous fiscal year's loss of 27bn yen ($223.5m).\nOverall, the company's finances, however, looked far less bleak than Hitachi's previous forecast of a 55bn yen net loss ($455.4m) for 2006. The damage was offset by an increase in total sales, lead by its construction equipment division.\nTotal sales rose 8.3 per cent to 10.24 trillion yen ($84.8bn), from 9.47 trillion yen ($78.4bn) last year.<|endoftext|>Rendezvous at Walchensee.\nTwo Mercedes-Benz SL lady enthusiasts on a summer tour through Bavaria\u2019s Alpine upland for Classic Magazine.\nTrue roadster love.\nBeatrix Hoppen (left) and Christiane Philipp have lost their hearts to their Mercedes-Benz SLs. Both are businesswomen, and both are active in the brand club along with their husbands: Beatrix in R/C 107 SL Club in the Bonn region, while the Philipp couple manage an automotive master workshop, with Christiane being in charge of the R 129 SL Club\u2019s regional get-togethers in Ulm.\nDiscovery in Hamburg.\nBeatrix Hoppen\u2019s Mercedes-Benz 350 SL is an R 107 from 1972. Her husband discovered it 20 years later in response to an advertisement posted in a building at the port in Hamburg. Having taken the car apart with a view to a full restoration, the owner had subsequently aborted the project. Alois Hoppen bought the vehicle in knocked-down form, after which he rebuilt, restored and repainted it. Today, it is resplendent in petrol blue with a light leather interior.\nGuests at the shoot.\nAt the photo shoot, the team meets two young female students from Munich, who are looking to enjoy a beautiful day at Walchensee in Werdenfelser Land. Silke Franke (left) and Nadine Meyer can\u2019t believe their eyes: \u201cSuch cool cars. We\u2019d also like a convertible, especially on a day like today!\u201d The two young women marvel at the well-maintained interiors, the leather seats and door panels, the contrasting topstitching in the R 129, the wooden decor of the R 107. \u201cAnd the colours of the paintwork are something really special,\u201d says Nadine, full of enthusiasm.\nJewel from D\u00fcsseldorf.\nChristiane Philipp has a weakness for unusual cars. Her first one was small, bright red and fast. Her SL 320, built in 2000, model series R 129, is also fast. And smart. And special: \u201cI was looking online for an exciting SL. When I saw the color code 020 designo orange, I knew I wanted that one!\u201d The combination of the paint color with black and orange leather turns a special car into an extremely rare one. Only three examples of the R 129 were manufactured. The first owner of Christiane\u2019s SL was a doctor in D\u00fcsseldorf.\nAre they classic cars yet?\nSilke Franke is fascinated by the gem that Christiane Philipp acquired in 2009. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a classic, is it?\u201d she inquires. No, an R 129 is not a classic in the true sense. To qualify, it would have to be 30 or more years old. A Mercedes-Benz classic car begins its career at the age of 20, initially as a young classic. This category includes the R 129, which was sold between 1989 and 2002. While older exemplars are already sought-after classics, well-kept younger vehicles still look almost like new.\nThe marathon SL.\nAn unequalled production run: The Mercedes-Benz R 107 was in the Mercedes-Benz model range for a total of 18 years. Its career began in 1971 with the launch of the new 350 SL. The six- and eight-cylinder engines of the first series up to 1985 had a power output of 185 to 240 hp, which was phenomenal at that time. In 1985, the range of engines was renewed, along with a slight increase in output. Its era came to a close in 1989 after the production of almost 240,000 units: SL record! Today, the R 107 is a sought-after classic.\nThe young classic"

Using this algorithm a distance between two plants is defined as the cost of transforming one into the other (using basic \"edit operations\"). We illustrate this method in three application fields and then compare it with other methods for quantifying plant similarity.<|endoftext|>Lichelle Marie sex videos where she get an assfucking.

However, gemcitabine resistance was related to limited intracellular uptake of gemcitabine through a decrease in human equilibrative nucleoside transporter (hENT1) protein expression.[299] Several studies have shown that high levels of hENT1 are associated with significantly longer survival after adjuvant gemcitabine,[300] and gemcitabine should not be used for patients with low tumor hENT1 expression.[301] The expression of hENT1 is epithelial, and consequently, it can be detectable in biopsies containing malignant epithelial cells. No study has yet shown the reliability of this assessment in either FNA or core biopsy samples.\nOne of the most exciting developments of cancer therapy in the last few years has been the remarkable progress of immunotherapy. Despite the minimal response rates in pancreatic cancer, an immune response is still present and emerging strategies to turn this response on or identify tumors with an immune-sensitive phenotype are promising. It would be therefore interesting to be able to characterize the infiltrating immune cells in EUS-FNA samples.\nThere has been tremendous progress over the past decade to overcome the limitations of EUS-FNA due to sampling technique, procedure, and equipment. Refined techniques such as molecular analysis of EUS-FNA samples are being continuously investigated. EUS-FNA will play a major role in personalized cancer therapy in the years to come.\nResearch in EUS appears to be intensive as specialists continue to study the clinical impact of the procedure, to improve and refine the current indications for it, and to pursue new applications for the method.\nThis work was supported by a grant of Ministry of Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI, project number PN-III-P4-ID-PCE-2016-0561, within PNCDI III.\nDr. Irina M.

Mabel for obvious reasons, but Dipper's overarching story revolves around accepting that not all crushes will work out, and around accepting himself as he is. \n\nThere's also an episode about a healthy outlook on masculinity, and it all strikes me as something an Aphrodite kid would go through. Bill even tried to use Dipper's crush on Wendy as motivation to keep him trapped in the imagination bubble. (Not a chance to study the world or be the greatest scientist ever like he did with Ford, but to live with Wendy forever.) In that same episode he tells Gideon that love can't be forced. \n\nHe also (correctly) told Mabel that matching Robbie with someone new would mess up the social structure of the group.

The project was prompted by a lack of brass repertoire appropriate for collegiate auditions. CAP brass faculty thus commissioned renowned composer Anthony Plog to write a set of six new works for trumpet, trombone, horn, tuba, euphonium, and bass trombone. Dee Stewart and CAP assembled a roster of world-class performers and pedagogues to premiere these six compositions. In addition to recordings of the premieres, Adventures in Brass contains interviews with these faculty in which they provide technical, artistic, and practical guidance to young brass players preparing to apply to college. These videos were captured by and are shared with the help of Tony Tadey and the MITS Video production team of the Jacobs School of Music.

The occurrence of cerebral vascular diseases accompanying PPTA was studied. Among the 4,650 patients with MRA examined, 25 were identified as having PPTA; the prevalence of PPTA was.54%. The Saltzman classification of PPTAs was as follows: type I, 24%; type II, 16%; type III, 60%. Sixteen percent of the cases with PPTA were accompanied with intracranial aneurysm. A 3D-TOF MRA at 3.0 T can be used for the detection of PPTA and making a classification of PPTA indirectly. The incidence of PPTA with type III was greater than that of other types of PPTA. Intracranial aneurysm appeared to be associated with PPTA.

Materials and methods: 1353 consecutive CTPA cases for suspected PE were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into seven age groups: {<=}29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79 and {>=}80 years. Differences between the groups were tested using Fisher's exact or chi-square test. A p-value < 0.0024 indicated statistical significance when Bonferroni correction was used. Results: Incidence rates of PE ranged from 11.4% to 25.4% in different age groups. The three main APF were pleural effusion, pneumonia and pulmonary nodules. No significant difference was found between the incidences of PE in different age groups. Furthermore, APF in different age groups revealed no significant differences (all p-values > 0.0024). Conclusion: The incidences of PE and APF detected by CTPA reveal no significant differences between various age groups.\nPurposeTo evaluate changes in imaging findings on CT during hepatic arteriography (CTHA) and CT during arterial portography (CTAP) by balloon occlusion of the treated artery and their relationship with iodized oil accumulation in the tumor during balloon-occluded transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (B-TACE).MethodsBoth B-TACE and angiography-assisted CT were performed for 27 hepatocellular carcinomas. Tumor enhancement on selective CTHA with/without balloon occlusion and iodized oil accumulation after B-TACE were evaluated. Tumorous portal perfusion defect size on CTAP was compared with/without balloon occlusion. Factors influencing discrepancies between selective CTHA with/without balloon occlusion and the degree of iodized oil accumulation were investigated.ResultsAmong 27 tumors, tumor enhancement on selective CTHA changed after balloon occlusion in 14 (decreased, 11; increased, 3). In 18 tumors, there was a discrepancy between tumor enhancement on selective CTHA with balloon occlusion and the degree of accumulated iodized oil, which was higher than the tumor enhancement grade in all 18. The tumorous portal perfusion defect on CTAP significantly decreased after balloon occlusion in 18 of 20 tumors (mean decrease from 21.9 to 19.1\u00c2 mm in diameter; p\u00c2 =\u00c2 0.0001). No significant factors influenced discrepancies between selective CTHA with/without balloon occlusion. Central area tumor location, poor tumor enhancement on selective CTHA with balloon occlusion, and no decrease in the tumorous portal perfusion defect area on CTAP after balloon occlusion significantly influenced poor iodized oil accumulation in the tumor.ConclusionsTumor enhancement on selective CTHA frequently changed after balloon occlusion, which did not correspond to accumulated iodized oil in most cases.\nFour pediatric patients with extrahepatic portal hypertension had undergone portography and computerized radionuclide angiography in order to examine shape of portal system and to evaluate hepatic blood flow before and aftersurgical treatment. In all patients, cavernous transformation of portal system was demonstrated by portography, and in one of them spontaneous splenorenal shunt occurred. In 3 of them, who underwent esophageal transsection combined with paraesophagogastric devascularization and splenectomy, so-called direct operation, increase of portal blood flow was revealed by computerized radionuclide angiography. It is suggested that direct operation increasing portal blood flow after surgery is effective in treating extrahepatic portal hypertension in childhood.\nJoseph, G.J.; Barrow, D.L.; Hoffman, J.C.; O'Brien, M.K.\nIn previous articles we outlined a subtraction scheme for regularizing doubly-real emission and real-virtual emission in next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) calculations of jet cross sections in electron-positron annihilation.

From her bed, Ravine describes the Leicester council estate where she lives with her mother Rekha \u2013 a sari and trainer wearing Bangladeshi woman who feeds leftover chapatti to the ducks at the local park and is determined to help Ravine get out of bed.\nSnaith\u2019s captivating writing style creates characters almost real enough to step out of the pages. We meet Ravine\u2019s best friend Marianne Dickerson and her brother Jonathan through a series of flashbacks that are interwoven into the narrative. Although the action is centred around Ravine and her friends, it was the mother-daughter relationship between Rekha and Ravine that really stood out for me \u2013 I loved the dynamic between them and the way that Ravine often chastised her mother for being embarrassing although you got the feeling that Ravine wouldn\u2019t change her mother for the world.\nSnaith\u2019s portrayal of family life on a council estate is honest and refreshing. When Mrs Dickerson abandons her children to go \u2018on a holiday\u2019, the mysterious Uncle Walter steps in. The larger-than-life army veteran teaches the children Italian and how to survive bear attacks and unwittingly becomes a father figure who offers a taste of a world outside of the council estate for the children.\nThe Things We Thought We Knew offers a unique take on the bildungsroman form. Even though the novel isn\u2019t the kind of book I would usually read, Snaith\u2019s writing style makes it easy to become completely absorbed in Ravine\u2019s world. The novel has hints of magical realism throughout which adds an element of intrigue. The suspense built up throughout the narrative definitely makes it a page-turner \u2013 I couldn\u2019t put it down!\nMaisie Bamford is currently studying for an MA in Modern Literature at the University of Leicester. She had her first poem published in the Leicester Writes anthology Welcome to Leicester in 2016 and is currently working on a collection of short stories.<|endoftext|>The Birman is a striking breed with similar colouring to Siamese cats.

This medium-sized cat has a luscious, bushy tail.\nRed, cream, chocolate, seal, blue, seal tortie tabby, blue tabby, seal tabby and the female only colour of seal torti.\nThe Birman is generally a very healthy breed although is prone to hair balls. These can be prevented by regular brushing and baths.\nThis breed is known to be docile but has an intelligent personality and loves to play.\nThis breed requires around 70 kilocalories of food per kilo of bodyweight each day. They have a good appetite and can be prone to obesity.\nThe Birman needs plenty of attention and coat care. They need to be brushed a few times a week and bathed every season to clean their coats of dead hair. Owners should also be careful of the quality of kitty litter used as cheaper options may stain the light coloured coat of your Birman.\nOriginally developed in Burma, the Birman was considered a sacred companion of the Kitteh priests. In 1919 the Birman arrived in Europe with a pair of Englishman who were given a Birman cat as a gesture of gratitude after protecting a temple from enemy invasion. The Federation of Feline Francaise recognised the Birman as a pedigree breed in 1925. The high breed standard produced today has endured decades of devoted experimentation.<|endoftext|>Have a question? Please read our FAQ!\nMewsic Kitty is the best place in Nashville to adopt a cat.

Email |||EMAIL_ADDRESS||| Background: Few studies reported the outcomes of minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) in treating patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). The aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of nCRT plus MIE (RM) strategy in treating locally advanced resectable ESCC.\nMethods: This retrospective study included 175 patients with ESCC undergoing surgical resection after neoadjuvant therapy in our institution from 2010 to 2016. Patients were stratified into three groups: RM, [neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nCT) plus MIE] (CM) and [nCT plus open esophagectomy (OE)] (CO).\nResults: Seventy-six (43.4%), 42 (24%) and 57 (32.6%) patients received RM, CM and CO approach, respectively. Compared with CO approach, RM or CM approach had shorter operation duration (188\u00b139, 185\u00b137 vs. 209\u00b145 minutes, P=0.004, P=0.009) and less blood loss (124\u00b188, 122\u00b179 vs. 166\u00b192 mL, P=0.001, P=0.003). There was a trend with lower risk of postoperative non-surgical complications in RM and CM approach [odds ratio (OR) 0.45, 0.200\u20131.040; P=0.062; OR 0.41, 0.150\u20131.160; P=0.093]. There were no differences in 30- and 90-day mortality among all groups. RM approach was more likely to achieve pathological complete regression (27.6% vs. 4.8%, 1.8%, P=0.001, P=0.001) and fewer lymph node metastasis (25.0% vs. 57.1%, 61.4%, P=0.001, P=0.001) than CM or CO approach. Survival analysis revealed a potential trend towards improved overall survival in RM approach compared with CM or CO approach (P=0.098, P=0.166).\nConclusions: RM approach was a safe and efficient strategy in treating locally advanced resectable ESCC.\nSubmitted Sep 22, 2017. Accepted for publication Dec 13, 2017.\nNeoadjuvant therapy, both neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nCT), has been proved to improve survival for patients with esophageal cancer. A landmark supporting nCRT in treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancer was the CROSS trial performed by van Hagen et al. (1), which showed better R0 rate, lower node-positive rate and longer survival without increasing severe postoperative morbidity and mortality. However, accumulating evidences suggested nCRT may result in higher incidence of postoperative mortality for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) (2,3). Thereafter, nCT, a safe approach (3-6) showing improved survival compared with surgery alone, is being applied as the standard approach for ESCC in the east.\nAs is known to all, minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) had great advantages in improving short-term outcomes without compromised long-term survival (7-9). Recently, it is also demonstrated MIE is an acceptable surgical therapy for advanced-stage esophageal malignancies after nCRT (10-13). Nevertheless, the studies available included majorities of patients with adenocarcinoma located in the distal esophagus, which might be more favourable for MIE. As for locally advanced bulky ESCC, it is dangerous to resect as is mainly located in upper or middle-third of esophagus and closely adjacent to the tracheobronchial tree. The safety of MIE after neoadjuvant therapy in treating such patients has never been evaluated in a relative large sample size. Moreover, as patients with ESCC suffered from high incidence of postoperative mortality after nCRT, it is worthwhile to investigate whether MIE could lower the risk of mortality after neoadjuvant therapy, whether nCRT plus MIE (RM) approach could be rendered as a safe and efficient approach for locally advanced ESCC.\nThis retrospective study was performed to compare outcomes in patients with locally advanced resectable ESCC undergoing RM, nCT plus MIE (CM) or [nCT plus open esophagectomy (OE)] (CO) approach and aims to illustrate the value of RM approach in treatment of locally advanced resectable ESCC.\nBetween January 2010 to December 2016, patients completing neoadjuvant therapy followed by esophagectomy (n=194) were selected and their medical records were reviewed. The inclusion criteria were (I) thoracic ESCC; (II) McKeown or (III) Ivor-Lewis approach, no history of concomitant or previous malignancy. Therefore, 175 patients were eligible for analysis. The flow chart was shown in Figure 1. Pretreatment examinations, including endoscopy with biopsies, thoracoabdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT), cervical ultrasonography, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and/or positron emission tomography (PET) were used to determine the clinical stage. Patients were evaluated in a multidisciplinary procedure and those with locally advanced resectable carcinoma (clinical stage T3/T4a, any N) were considered for neoadjuvant therapy in our institution. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University (No. 2017236) and informed consent was obtained from each participant.\nFigure 1 The flow diagram. SCC, squamous cell carcinoma; nCT, neoadjuvant chemotherapy; nCRT, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy; MIE, minimally invasive esophagectomy; OE, open esophagectomy.\nnCRT was based on the CROSS regimen (1). Radiotherapy with 40 Gy was delivered in 20 fractions with 2 Gy per time on days 1\u20135, days 8\u201312, days 15\u201319 and days 22\u201326. Chemotherapy consisted of 4 cycles of carboplatin [2 mg/mL/min area under the curve (AUC)] and paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 on day 6, 13, 20, 27.\nNCT comprised 2 cycles of chemotherapy with cisplatin 75 mg/m2 or oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks.\nPatients were evaluated and scheduled for surgery if they were medically suitable for esophagectomy 4\u20136 weeks after the completion of neoadjuvant therapy. The operation was performed using an open or minimally invasive approach. Any surgery with thoracotomy was identified as OE approach, the other as MIE. Decisions regarding the type of surgery administered were left to the discretion of the surgeon. MIE was administrated in 2004 in our department. Surgeons were well experienced in MIE. The detailed procedure of MIE was described in previous literature (14). More specifically, McKeown procedure was used for upper, middle or lower esophageal tumors, and Ivor-Lewis procedure for middle or lower tumors. If tumor is located in upper third of the esophagus, cervical lymph nodes must be dissected. All patients received at least two-field lymphadenectomy and en bloc dissection of regional lymph node was performed, including the paraesophageal, paratracheal, right tracheobronchial, subcarinal, pulmonary ligament, diaphragmatic, and paracardial, as well as those located along the lesser gastric curvature, the origin of the left gastric artery, the common hepatic artery, and the splenic artery. The histological diagnosis was determined by the World Health Organization classifications. Pathological staging was performed according to the latest ypTNM classification (8th edition) of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC, 2017) (15).\nThe medical records were used to collect demographic data, tumor information and hospital courses. The classification of complications was recorded according to International Consensus of Esophagectomy Complications Consensus Group (ECCG) (16) and the severity of complications was classified according to the Clavien-Dindo scoring system (17). Follow-up visits were carried out every 3 months in the first 2 years and every 6 months in the following years. Follow-up was terminated in December 31st, 2016 and two patients were lost to follow up.\nThe SPSS 23.0 software was used for data analysis. Categorical variables in any two groups were compared by \u03c72 test or Fisher\u2019s exact test and continuous variables by Mann-Whitney U test. Logistic regression was used to compare various complication rates between any two groups and adjusted by potential confounding effects of covariates [age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, clinical T stage (cT), clinical N stage (cN), tumor location]. Overall survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test in 80 patients following up for at least 3 years. The significance level was set at 0.05.\nThe study included 175 patients with ESCC undergoing surgery after neoadjuvant therapy (flow chart shown in Figure 1). RM approach was given to 76 patients (43.4%) and the other 99 patients (56.6%) received nCT, including 42 patients (24%) undergoing MIE (CM group) and 57 patients (32.6%) undergoing OE (CO group). Sixty-eight patients (89.5%) in the RM group completed the planning neoadjuvant scheme, while 36 (85.7%) and 50 (87.7%) in the CM and CO groups, respectively. The overall postoperative morbidity rate was 44.5%, and the 30- and 90-day mortality rates were 1.71% and 2.86%, respectively. It was shown that CO and CM approach was practiced more frequently in the early years, whereas RM increased over time. In the last 2 years"

By applying these two operative procedures, over 90% of operation cases of esophageal cancer are able to be completed thoracoscopically.\nVATS three-stage esophagectomy with extensive lymphadenectomy was performed by HATS or Prone procedure with gastric tube reconstruction and the cervical anastomosis.\nHATS: The left lateral decubitus position is used for HATS. Assistant surgeon inserts his left hand into the right thoracic cavity from the abdominal incision through the anterior phreno-mediastial route. Retraction of the lung and trachea are thus done manually with the hand of the assistant. The abdominal incision is then used for hand assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS).\nThe advantage of HATS is the gentle retraction of the lung from the caudal side of the thorax, thus obviating the need for lung retractors. Furthermore, this procedure allows the surgeon\u2019s hand to use its sense of touch within the thoracic cavity, which can also confirm whether or not the tumor has invaded the surrounding organs such as the trachea.\nProne: Patient placed by the prone position. By this positioning with positive CO2 pressure to the thoracic cavity, the right lung falls away from the operative field both by gravity and the artificial pneumothorax, a good visual exposure of the esophagus without assistant\u2019s help.\nThe advantage of this procedure is the superior visualization of the lower mediastinum. Thus, lower esophageal cancer case is the good applicant for this operation.\nSince 1996, we experienced 134 cases of VATS esophagectomy, which includes 103 cases of HATS and 7 cases of Prone.\nThe average of the amount of blood loss was 840mL, and the operation time of thoracic approach was 252min. In hospital mortality rate was 1.5%.\nVideo assisted esophagectomy with extensive lymphadenectomy for thoracic esophageal cancer is feasible procedure in term of the less invasive surgery.<|endoftext|>The RESPECT Index distinguishes companies that are managed in a sustainable and responsible manner, and at the same time it highlights their investment attractiveness.

However, considering that the number of forecasting factors is numerous, a single forecasting model has certain limitations and a runo \ufb00 time series consists of complex nonlinear and nonstationary characteristics, which make the runo \ufb00 forecasting di \ufb03 cult. Aimed at improving the prediction accuracy of annual runo \ufb00 time series, the principal components analysis (PCA) method is adopted to reduce the complexity of forecasting factors, and a modi\ufb01ed coupling forecasting model based on multiple linear regression (MLR), back propagation neural network (BPNN), Elman neural network (ENN), and particle swarm optimization-support vector machine for regression (PSO-SVR) is proposed and applied in the Dongbei Hydrological Station in the Ganjiang River Basin. Firstly, from two conventional factors (i.e., rainfall, runo \ufb00 ) and 130 atmospheric circulation indexes (i.e., 88 atmospheric circulation indexes, 26 sea temperature indexes, 16 other indexes), principal components generated by linear mapping are screened as forecasting factors. Then, based on above forecasting factors, four forecasting models including MLR, BPNN, ENN, and PSO-SVR are developed to predict annual runo \ufb00 time series. Subsequently, a coupling model composed of BPNN, ENN, and PSO-SVR is constructed by means of a multi-model information fusion taking three hydrological years (i.e., wet year, normal year, dry year) into consideration. Finally, according to residual error correction, a modi\ufb01ed coupling forecasting model is introduced so as to further improve the accuracy of the predicted annual runo \ufb00 time series in the veri\ufb01cation period.\n\n\nIntroduction\nHydrological forecasting, especially medium and long-term runoff forecasting, is an indispensable part of water resources management and water conservancy projects' operation [1][2][3]. Forecasting at different time scales can provide valuable information for flood control, power generation, water supply, and drought resistance [4][5][6][7]. Medium and long-term runoff forecasting, with a forecast period of patterns. The prediction results indicated that the proposed hybrid model was a far better technique compared to the original support vector machine (SVM) model [27].\nApart from selecting appropriate forecasting models, identifying key predictors driving runoff variation is another step towards developing a reliable forecasting model [28]. Rough set (RS), global sensitivity analysis (GSA), factor analysis (FA), principal component analysis (PCA), Gamma test (GT), and forward selection (FS) techniques are used to reduce the number of input variables for recognizing forecasting factors [29]. With the development of information theory, mutual information (MI) as a measure representing information between two random variables provides optional means for screening forecasting factors [30]. To tackle key problems of generating minimal inference rule set and selecting complex factors, Zhu et al. (2009) proposed a forecasting model integrating the rough set theory with the fuzzy inference technique to improve the medium and long-term forecast precision [31]. Five principal impact factors were recognized by Li et al. (2012) by means of GSA and the back-propagation arithmetic, and these were pivotal factors that make a great difference to runoff during the flood season in the Nenjiang River Basin [29]. Some input selection techniques (e.g., GT, FS) designed to reduce the number of input variables, were fed to an SVM model to predict the monthly streamflow, and the developed GT-SVM model was superior to the original SVM model [32]. As a multivariate statistical technique used to identify important factors, PCA has been proposed to reduce the number of variables by providing a better interpretation of variables involving large volumes of information, as well as reducing the computational dimension [33,34]. Moreover, the information from independent and linear compound input variables is capable of presenting us with the minimum losses by employing this method [35]. Thus, PCA is acknowledged to be pivotal towards reducing the complexity of input variables and has been widely adopted into simplifying forecasting factors.\nNevertheless, it is simply not stable to rely on a single forecasting model, such as multiple linear regression (MLR), back propagation neural network (BPNN), Elman neural network (ENN), and particle swarm optimization-support vector machine for regression (PSO-SVR), to predict annual runoff, for runoff time series tending to be nonlinear, nonstationary and, even, chaotic. In view of this, multi-model information fusion technology and residual error correction methods are introduced to acquire more accurate annual runoff, taking the advantages of different forecasting methods into account [36,37]. The main objective of this paper is to develop a modified coupling forecasting model to predict annual runoff time series. Firstly, key forecasting factors are screened from two conventional factors (i.e., rainfall and runoff) and 130 atmospheric circulation indexes, with the help of PCA. Then, annual runoff time series are predicted by using the MLR model, the BPNN model, the ENN model, and the PSO-SVR model, respectively. Subsequently, a coupling model is constructed to predict annual runoff according to the multi-model information fusion technique. Finally, the residual error correction method is employed to further modify annual runoff time series in the validation period.\n\nStudy Area\nAs the seventh"

This includes any sharp physical movements like simple coughing, or vigorous vomiting and straining; and you are at more risk when pregnant, or if you are currently overweight or obese.\nOther causes of hiatus hernia include sedentary occupations, without sensible exercise, overweight resulting from overeating, smoking, shallow breathing and mental and emotional tensions.\na) Congenital weakness.\nb) Acquired weakness due to injuries, wasting of muscles, suppurative lesions in the wall and presence of weak natural openings, obesity, lack of exercise, repeated pregnancy.\nc) Surgical operation with improper suturing or sepsis of operated site.\na) Chronic constipation.\nb) Recurrent cough.\nc) Weight lifting.\nd) Stricture of urethra.\nHiatal hernias occur more often in people over the age of 50, in overweight people (especially women), and in smokers.\nSometimes a hiatus hernia can lead to more serious problems.\nThe blood supply to your stomach can also be affected if a segment of your stomach gets tightly trapped in your chest area.\nIf you have a rolling hiatus hernia, your stomach can become blocked, leading to pain and vomiting.\nIf the hernial orifice is narrow the abdominal contents may not go back easily, and later the blood flow to the herniated tissues may be blocked due to constriction. This can cause death of protruded intestine.\nThis occurs when the whole portion of the intestine is protruded in to the hernial sac. The narrow hernial orifice will block the passage of bowels.\nIf there is strangulation with death of a portion of intestine there will be spread of infection to the abdomen resulting in peritonitis.\nIf your ulcers bleed, you may vomit blood. A bleeding ulcer can also lead to anaemia, a condition where you have too few red blood cells or not enough oxygen-carrying haemoglobin in your blood.\nIn the long term, when ulcers have healed they can cause narrowing of your oesophagus, which can make swallowing difficult and painful and cause you to regurgitate food.\nThis allows a doctor to look inside the body using a narrow, flexible, tube-like telescopic camera called an endoscope.\nYour doctor will use it to look closely at any sore spots or ulcers and can take a sample of tissue (a biopsy), if needed.\nX-ray with barium.\nThis test involves swallowing a drink containing a substance called barium, a powdered metal that illuminates the digestive organs during X-rays.\nYou may also be asked for a sample of blood to check for anaemia.\nIn most cases, sufferers experience no discomfort and no treatment is required. However, when the hiatal hernia is large, or is of the paraesophageal type, it is likely to cause esophageal stricture and discomfort.\n1) Use of hernia belt: Special types of hernia belts are available for each type of heania.This will prevent the protrusion and will reduce pain.\n2) Constipation, recurrent cough, urinary obstruction eyv should be treated.\n3) Fat reduction will increase the strength of abdominal wall.\n4) Abdominal exercises to increase the muscle tone.\n5) Take plenty of leafy vegetables, fruits and fibrous diet for easy bowel movements.\n6) Try other systems like Homoeopathy, Herbal medicine.\nIf no relief by the above steps consult a general surgeon for surgical management.\nIn a small number of cases, a hiatal hernia may require surgery. Surgery is generally reserved for emergency situations and for people who aren't helped by medications to relieve heartburn and acid reflux. Hiatal hernia repair surgery is often combined with surgery for gastroesophageal reflux disease.\nAn operation for a hiatal hernia may involve pulling your stomach down into your abdomen and making the opening in your diaphragm smaller, reconstructing a weak esophageal sphincter, or removing the hernia sac.\nIn some cases, this is done using a single incision in your chest wall (thoracotomy) or abdomen (laparotomy). In other cases, your surgeon may insert a tiny camera and special surgical tools through several small incisions in your abdomen.\nThe operation is then performed while your surgeon views images from inside your body that are displayed on a video monitor (laparoscopic surgery).\nThe following operations are done depending up on the type and nature of hernia.\nIn this operation the contents of hernial sac is pushed in to the abdomen and neck of the sac is ligated with transfixion ligature and the sac is cut off.\nHere along with herniotomy the posterior wall is repaired.\nThis operation is done if herniotomy is not possible due to wide neck of the sac.Here the repair is done with the healp of non absorbable materials like tantalum gauze,polypropylene mesh or stainless steel mesh.\n\u2022\tPractice relaxation techniques eg: meditation, yoga, deep breathing and learn how to better manage stress.\nIn the beginning of the treatment, it would be advisable to raise the head end of the bed by placing bricks below the legs of the bed. This will prevent the regurgitation of food during the night. More pillow can also be used for the same purpose.\nThe next important step towards treating hiatus hernia is relaxation. An important measure in this direction is diaphragmatic breathing. The procedure is as follows : lie down with both knees bent and feet close to buttocks. Feel relaxed.\nPut both the hands lightly on the abdomen and concentrate the attention of this area. Now breathe in, gently pushing the abdominal up under the hands at the same time, until no more air can be inhaled.\nThen relax, breathing out through the mouth with an audible sighing sound and allow the abdominal wall to sink back. The shoulders and chest should, remain at rest throughout.\nIt is important to be able to relax at any time and thereby prevent building up of physical and mental tensions which may cause actual physical symptoms.\nThe best method for this is practice shavasana, or \u2018dead body \u2018 pose. The procedure for this Asian has been explained in chapter 7 on yoga therapy.\nDrinking water with meals increases the overall weight in the stomach, slows down the digestive process by diluting the digestive process and this increases the risk of fermentation and gas formation, which distends the stomach and causes discomfort and pain.\nAnother important factor in the treatment of this disease is to take frequent small meals instead of three large ones. Thorough mastication of foods is also essential, both to break up the food into small particles and to slow down the rate of intake.\nThe diet of the patient should consist of seeds, nuts and whole cereal grains, vegetables and fruits, with emphasis on fresh fruits, raw or lightly cooked vegetables and sprouted seeds.\nThe foods which should be avoided are over-processed foods like white bread and sugar, cakes and biscuits, rice puddings and over cooked vegetables.\nAt least 50 per cent of the diet should consist of fruits and vegetables, and the remaining 50 per cent of protein, carbohydrates and fat.\nRaw juices extracted from fresh fruits and vegetables are valuable in haitus hernia, and the patient should take these juices half an hour before each meal. Carrot juice is specially beneficial as it has a very restorative effect, and is rich in vitamin A and calcium.\nIt is an alkaline food which soothes the stomach. All juices should be diluted with water on a 50: 50 basis as they are concentrated.\nThe hot drinks should always be allowed to cool a little before taking. Extremes in temperature, in both food and drink should be avoided, drinks should not be taken hurriedly, but sipped slowly.\nThe patient should avoid condiments, pickles, strong tea, coffee, alcoholic beverages and smoking.\nAs Aloe Vera Juice is a refreshing and anti-bacterial drink, you might find that taking this daily, diluted in some filtered water will not only refresh you like \u2018a shower inside you\u2019 but also assists in dealing with any digestive issues you may also be experiencing.\nFurther reading through our articles on Hiatus Hernia health issues will give you a body of information that will help you decide what options you have to deal with the underlying causes of your problem through giving your body the nutrition products that will assist you body to heal from the inside out.\nWe wish you well in your search for solutions to this Hiatus Hernia problem and your movement towards better health in all areas.\nWhat Can You Do For Hiatus Hernia Relief?\nHiatus Hernia and GERD - Is This Condition Dangerous?\nSITE DISCLAIMER: Do these products \u201ccure\u201d anything?

This is best achieved by passing a cloth tape measure around the head.\nAlternatively a piece of string may be used and measured against a ruler or tape measure. It is important that this measurement is taken where a hat would normally rest.\nTo take a measurement position the tape measure or string so that it rests just above the brow at the front of the head, touching the top of the ears at the side. Pull the tape so that it is taut but not too tight and take a measurement.\nHats are sized to the nearest whole centimetre so it is advisable to size up if your head falls between two measurements.\nBritish hat sizes are given in an imperial measurement of the diameter of the head in inches.

CT and PET scan images of benign type tumors fused together using the proposed fusion algorithm and the same way MRI and PET scan images of malignant type tumors fused together to achieve the combined benefits of individual imaging techniques. Then the Marker controlled watershed Algorithm applied on fused image to segment cancer affected area. The various color features, shape features and texture-based features extracted from the segmented image. Then a data set formed with various features, which have given as input to different classifiers namely neural network classifier, Random forest classifier, K-NN classifier to determine the nature of cancer. The results of the classifier will be Normal, Benign or Malignant category of cancer.\nResults: The performance of the proposed fusion Algorithm compared with existing fusion techniques based on the parameters PSNR, SSIM, Entropy, Mean and Standard Deviation. Curvelet transform based fusion method performs better than already existing methods in terms of five parameters. The performances of classifiers are evaluated using three parameters Accuracy, Sensitivity, and Specificity. K-NN Classifier performs better when compared to the other two classifiers and it provides overall accuracy of 94%, Sensitivity of 88% and Specificity of 84%.\nConclusion: The proposed Curvelet transform based image fusion method combined with the K-NN classifier provides better results when compared to other two classifiers when two input images used individually.<|endoftext|>extends PlayerBaseState\n\nconst MOVE_ACCEL = 7.0\n\nfunc physics_update(delta: float) -> void:\n\tplayer._rotate_player_process(10.0, delta)\n\t\n\tvar vDirection = player._velocity.normalized().rotated(\n\t\tVector3.UP, \n\t\t-player.rotation.y)\n\t\n\tvar animationBlendAmount = player._velocity.length() / player.MAX_MOVE_VELOCITY\n\tplayer._animationTree.set(\n\t\t\"parameters/Idle_To_Run/blend_amount\", \n\t\tanimationBlendAmount)\n\n\tplayer._animationTree.set(\n\t\t\"parameters/Run_Blend/blend_position\", \n\t\tVector2(vDirection.x, -vDirection.z/2))"

I know I shouldn't have but I start getting my hopes up. Then he confesses that he lied about his age and he is a couple of years older than he said, which makes him as old as me. That's not a problem in itself but still it's a lie and it makes me a bit wary. Jokingly I ask him if he lied about anything else, like forgetting he's married or something, and that's when he admits that he lied about the city where he lives. He actually lives 2-3 hrs from where I do, instead of 1 hr like I thought. I know that's not a big distance but the point is that he lied about it, which makes me wonder if he was honest about anything he told me. I was very clear from the beginning that I want a committed relationship while now my impression is that he's looking for a fling so obviously the distance doesn't matter much or maybe he really is married and looking for an affair. I asked him for an explanation and if he has a Facebook profile to check if there's anything true about what he told me but maybe I should just write him off because obviously I can't trust anything he tells me.

Male gender and alcohol use are predisposing risk factors. Most of the cases are iatrogenic or traumatic; nonetheless, spontaneous cases are not uncommon. It typically occurs after vomiting or straining as the increased intra-abdominal pressure transmits into the esophagus and results in the tear. One of the main complications is acute bacterial mediastinitis from contamination with esophageal flora. This condition can be life-threatening because it is very frequently misdiagnosed and appropriate management is often delayed.\nA 49-year-old man presented with worsening sudden-onset interscapular back pain that then changed to chest pain with odynophagia and was found to have fever and leukocytosis.\nChest computed tomography revealed signs of mediastinitis with possible esophageal perforation. He reported symptoms started 2 days ago after lifting of heavy objects. Empiric antimicrobial was begun with conservative management and avoidance of oral intake. Barium esophagram and esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed no signs of perforation or inflammation. His symptoms resolved and he gradually resumed oral intake. Blood cultures grew Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and he was discharged on appropriate antibiotics for 4 weeks. He did well on follow-up 3 months after hospitalization.\nThe case highlights the importance of considering esophageal etiologies of chest pain.\nA 49-year-old man presented to our Emergency Department complaining of chest pain. It began 2 days prior to presentation while lifting heavy objects at home and was described as interscapular upper back stiffness then became midsternal and inspirational. The following day, he started to feel fatigued with fevers, anorexia, odynophagia, and nausea but denied vomiting. His medical history included hypertension and he had no surgical history. He had recent prolonged traveling. He used to drink socially but denied smoking. Vitals were stable with temperature of 38.4 \u00b0C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure 129/81 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min. Physical examination was normal. Laboratory workup revealed leukocytosis of 14,640/\u03bcL with a predominance of neutrophils (82.4%). Electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, and serum Troponin T were normal. Given the history of traveling and pleuritic feature of chest pain, computed tomographic (CT) angiography was ordered. It ruled out pulmonary embolism; however, it showed mediastinal soft-tissue infiltration and stranding of the upper paraesophageal posterior mediastinal fat (Figure 1). These findings were concerning for mediastinitis due to possible esophageal perforation. Blood cultures were obtained then empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy with intravenous Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam was initiated. Although barium esophagram did not show any signs of perforation (Figure 2), patient was instructed to avoid all oral intake during hospitalization. Because he was hemodynamically stable, conservative management was sought. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was delayed for a few days in order to minimize risk of further esophageal perforation. Interestingly, it later did not show any signs of inflammation of the esophageal mucosa and only mild corporal gastritis, although biopsy did not show Helicobacter pylori. It was believed that the perforation had already healed spontaneously.\nComputed tomographic angiography in the Emergency Department shows mediastinal soft-tissue infiltration and stranding of the upper paraesophageal posterior mediastinal fat. No mediastinal gas is detected.\nEsophagram obtained on 2nd day of hospitalization showed no signs of esophageal perforation.\nThe blood cultures grew Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, therefore Vancomycin was discontinued and Piperacillin/Tazobactam was switched to intravenous Naficillin. Oral Metronidazole was started as well to provide coverage for anaerobes. Over the 6-day course of hospitalization, the fevers and leukocytosis resolved, the chest pain improved significantly, and"

The most recent information we have is that he will undergo a 10 day chemotherapy treatment and will spend the next six weeks in the hospital. After which, it is expected that he will be transferred to Colorado for a bone marrow transplant. It is unfair that a person as intelligent, humble, genuine, and selfless, as Isaiah, must undergo such a terrible disease. As you may imagine, the price of cancer treatment is unforgiving. We do not believe it necessary for him or his family to worry about the financial implications of treatment at this time. The funds will be used to help pay for his medical costs including chemotherapy, various radiological scans (CT scan, X-rays, etc.), a bone marrow transplant, and other pending medical costs. His focus and the focus of his family must be centered around him winning this battle against cancer. Any donations would mean the world to us and his family.

However, this is not entirely correct. In the first case, we are talking about a clinical diagnosis, which is based on the manifestation of symptoms such as heartburn and acid secretion into the esophagus. The diagnosis is confirmed by special tests that assess the degree of gastric juice reflux.\nHernia of the orifice of the diaphragm is a diagnosis of an anatomical change. It is quite difficult to detect it with tests, so a number of procedures are required to determine the diagnosis. For example, endoscopy of the upper abdomen or X-ray examination.\nIf the diagnosis is confirmed, the images will show how the hernia causes the valve mechanism to open, which encourages stomach contents to reflux back into the esophagus. At the same time, many patients complain of pain arising in the upper abdomen. But most hiatal hernias no larger than 2.5 inches are usually pain-free.\nIf an esophageal hernia of the diaphragm is large and causing pain, surgery may be necessary. Surgery can help prevent a pinched stomach.\nIs surgical treatment of a hiatal hernia mandatory?\nMost hiatal hernias are not accompanied by painful symptoms and are not dangerous. However, they can develop over time when the opening of the diaphragm through which the esophagus passes enlarges. Usually a hernia is diagnosed at the time when the patient has symptoms of reflux.\nThe diaphragm helps the valve between the stomach and esophagus work. People with a hiatal hernia often have reflux because the valve can no longer normally perform its natural functions. If hernias of the esophageal orifice of the diaphragm reach a large size, they are commonly called paraesophageal hernias. This diagnosis already threatens serious consequences for the patient and requires surgical intervention, even if the symptoms of the disease do not manifest themselves.\nMost hiatal hernias do not require surgery. However, if the hole in the diaphragm increases in size and grows into a paraesophageal hernia, surgery cannot be avoided. This can lead to torsion of the stomach and possible loss of the organ. In life practice, there are many cases where neglected hernias have caused deaths.\nParaesophageal hernias are one of the varieties of chiasal hernias, which occur when the size of the diaphragm increases. In such situations, there is a great risk of blockage of the stomach and loss of normal blood supply. At the same time, many patients experience constant chest pain and frequent abdominal bloating. In most cases, surgery will be necessary to prevent the loss of the stomach. In some situations, surgery must be performed in an emergency.\nTo do surgery or not, it is up to the attending physician to decide after all the tests are done. But in some cases, it is the only right decision when a hiatal hernia occurs. Most such hernias do not require surgery. The exception is when the patient has reflux. The surgeon fixes the hernia when performing surgery so that it does not grow beyond its size.\nas a result of aging of the body.\nMost often hernia of the esophageal orifice of the diaphragm is observed in the elderly. This is not surprising, because the tissues of the body with age significantly weaken, just because of this, a small hernia can increase in size and lead to undesirable consequences.\nWhen is surgical treatment of a hiatal hernia necessary?\nThe large size of a hernia of the esophageal orifice of the diaphragm can lead not only to unpleasant pain symptoms, but in some cases even to death. When the hole of the diaphragm exceeds 6 centimeters, the patient's stomach can be in the chest, which of course will bring discomfort when eating and cause pain. At the same time, people often experience bloating in the upper abdomen, early satiation with food, and shortness of breath.\nLarge hiatal hernias can also cause chronic blood loss, which subsequently threatens anemia. If all symptoms point to a hernia of the esophageal orifice of the diaphragm, it is likely that surgery cannot be avoided. In such cases, only surgery can help control the painful symptoms.\nSurgery can take place in the usual way or by laparoscopy. In the first case, an incision is made in the upper abdomen and the surgeon gently sews up the extra gap that has appeared in the diaphragm. The esophagus is not affected. After the operation, a suture is applied and appropriate procedures are prescribed for the recovery of the body.\nLaparoscopy is a gentler surgical procedure than conventional surgery. The surgeon makes 1-2 small incisions on the abdomen and with the help of special devices, the gap in the diaphragm is sewn up to its normal size. After laparoscopy, you will only need to stay in the hospital for 3-4 days, as the body recovers much faster. In some cases, patients are discharged the day after surgery.\nSurgery is always prescribed by the attending physician depending on the severity of the hernia and the symptoms. The patient's condition determines just what kind of surgery should be prescribed - conventional or laparoscopic surgery. Both situations have their own peculiarities. For example, laparoscopy requires a long general anesthesia, which is contraindicated for some people.\nAt the same time, such a surgical intervention is less traumatic to the tissues and requires a minimum of"

        "passage": " the son of Archibald Mitchell, the founder of nearby Springbank Distillery. In the second half of the 1800s William ran Springbank Distillery in a partnership with his brother John, while the other brothers and sister were active running the old Rieclachan Distillery across the town. The family were not just distillers but also farmers, which was quite a common thing in those days. The growing of barley and production of farmers\u2019 feed (a bi-product from mashing) meant that it made sense to run a distillery as well as being a farmer to keep the cost down. The farming element in the partnership with John didn\u2019t run very smoothly \u2013 allegedly the two brothers had a quarrel about sheep \u2013 and this saw William leave the family business to start up his own venture, Glengyle Distillery on the corner of Glebe Street and Glengyle Road, just down the road from Springbank. Mitchell\u2019s Glengyle Distillery was founded by William Mitchell in 1872 and he ran the distillery as a sole proprietor.Like the majority of Campbeltown distilleries, Glengyle suffered greatly during the economic downturn at the beginning of the 20th century. It was bought by West Highland Malt Distilleries Ltd in 1919 then sold again in 1924 for the princely sum of \u00a3300, before production finally ceased altogether in 1925. The entire spirit stock from the Glengyle Distillery was auctioned off on the 8th of April that same year. Despite not producing any more spirit, the Mitchell\u2019s Glengyle Distillery buildings remained in relatively constant use right up to modern days. In the 1920s the building was rented out to Campbeltown Miniature Rifle Club for a number of years and the buildings were later used a depot and sales office for an agricultural company and so it remained the best preserved of all the former Campbeltown distilleries. Possibly because the buildings were so well preserved, a number of attempts have been made to re-open Glengyle Distillery in the past. The first was a mere 16 years after it had closed down when it was bought by the Bloch Brothers, then owners of Glen Scotia Distillery, who planned to rebuild and extend Glengyle. The war intervened however and nothing came of it. A further attempt was made in 1957 when Campbell Henderson applied for outline planning permission to undertake a \u00a3250,000 modernisation of Glengyle and re-open it but again nothing came of it. Third time lucky though as in November 2000, 75 years after Glengyle had last produced spirit, it was announced that the buildings had been bought by a new company, Mitchell\u2019s Glengyle Limited, headed by Mr Hedley Wright, chairman of J&A Mitchell and Co Ltd, and great-great nephew of William Mitchell, original founder of Glengyle. Why name the whisky Kilkerran? Kilkerran is the name that was chosen for the single malt produced at Mitchell\u2019s Glengyle Distillery, there are two reasons for this. Firstly, because the name Glengyle is already used for a blended Highland malt and Mitchell\u2019s Glengyle Ltd were not able to purchase the rights to use that name. They also wished to avoid any possible confusion between the newest single malt to come from the Campbeltown region and a pre-existing blended Highland malt. Secondly, and more importantly, Mitchell\u2019s Glengyle Ltd are very proud to be continuing and adding to the great Campbeltown Distilling tradition and the choice of name reflects that. Kilkerran is derived from the Gaelic \u2018Ceann Loch Cille Chiarain\u2019 which is the name of the original settlement where Saint Kerran had his religious cell and where Campbeltown now stands. Kilkerran is thought to be a suitable name for a new Campbeltown malt since it was unusual for the old Campbeltown distilleries to be called after a Glen, a custom more usually associated with the Speyside region.<|endoftext|>What is Hiatal Hernia (Hiatus Hernia)?\nA hiatal hernia (hiatus hernia) happens when the top of the stomach bulges through an opening in the diaphragm.\nThe diaphragm is a muscle which separates the lungs from the rest of the abdomen. Domed in shape, it contracts and then flattens when a person inhales deeply.\nLocated on the left side of the diaphragm is a small opening, which allows the food pipe (esophagus) to pass into the stomach. This hole, which is called the hiatus, usually fits snugly around the food pipe. The stomach is located below the diaphragm.\nA hiatal hernia (hiatus hernia) occurs when the hole in the diaphragm becomes weak and gets bigger. This allows part of the stomach to enter the chest area.\nMany people experience heartburn after eating a large meal. However, if this happens frequently, it could be an indication of a hiatal hernia (hiatus hernia).\nHeartburn is caused by stomach acid entering the esophagus and irritating the lining.\nBelching generally happens after we eat too much or drink something fizzy. It is a way of letting excess gas out of the stomach.\nIndigestion (dyspepsia) can produce a number of different symptoms in relation to the stomach. Persistent indigestion could be a sign of acid reflux caused by a hiatal hernia (hiatus hernia).\nStomach acid travelling frequently up the esophagus may affect the windpipe. It can make the throat feel dry and result in a persistent cough.\nThere are no stages associated with hiatal hernia. There are, however, several different types.\nThis is the most common type of the condition, accounting for up to 95 percent of cases. The part of the stomach which is herniated slides in and out of the chest area.\nThis type of hernia is usually small and might not present any symptoms. As it causes no problems, the sufferer may be unaware they have this condition.\nHowever, symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux might be present, and become worse if the hernia enlarges.\nThe top of the stomach in this type of hernia is permanently located in the chest. It has pushed through the gap in the abdomen and stayed there (paraesophageal hernia).\nThere is potential in this hernia for the stomach to twist, cutting off the passage of food from the esophagus (strangulated hernia).\nThis type of hernia can become larger over time, requiring surgical intervention to correct it.\nThis is a combination of the previous two. The difference being that the place where the stomach and esophagus meet (gastroesophageal junction) has also moved above the diaphragm.\nThis type of hernia involves the displacement of other organs, such as the pancreas, spleen or colon, into the space above the diaphragm.\nTreatment for this condition is usually only necessary when there are symptoms which cause discomfort. These are generally acid reflux and heartburn, or problems swallowing.\nChanges to your lifestyle can help relieve the symptoms of a hiatal hernia (hiatus hernia) and the associated acid reflux.\nOther lifestyle choices, like smoking and alcohol, should be avoided.\nEating little and often can help. Avoid eating late at night, within about two to three hours before going to bed.\nThere are medicines available to treat the symptoms, either over the counter or by prescription.\nAntacids, which neutralize stomach acid, are readily available. A pharmacist can advise which might be suitable for the patient.\nProton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, block the production of acid and allow the esophagus to heal, reducing inflammation.\nH2 receptor blockers, such as cimetidine and ranitidine, reduce the amount of acid produced in the stomach.\nSurgery for a hiatal hernia (hiatus hernia) will generally only be considered when other treatments have not worked, or if there are complications.\nThe correction of this condition is usually done via keyhole surgery, under general anesthetic.\nWhat is a hiatal hernia (hiatus hernia)? This condition happens when the top of the stomach bulges through an opening in the diaphragm.\nWhat are the signs of a hiatal hernia (hiatus hernia)? The signs of this condition include: acid reflux, indigestion, wind, chest pain, difficulty swallowing or bad breath.\nHow do you develop a hiatal hernia (hiatus hernia)? The exact cause of this condition is unclear. However, it is prevalent in people over the age of 50 years. Several factors, such as being overweight and genetics, can play a part.\nWhat is the best treatment for hiatal hernia (hiatus hernia)? Lifestyle changes and medications are usually sufficient to improve this condition. There might be situations when surgery is required.\nWhat are the long term complications of hiatal hernia (hiatus hernia)? If a herniation is severe, the stomach can twist, causing it to become strangulated. Surgery is required to correct this.\nIs hiatal hernia (hiatus hernia) considered a disability? This condition is not considered a disability, however social security benefits might be paid in some instances.\nIs there a cure for hiatal hernia (hiatus hernia)? This condition often causes no discomfort. When it does, there are treatments available which are successful in managing the symptoms.\nIs a hiatal hernia (hiatus hernia) life threatening? This condition is not considered life threatening.\nA hiatal hernia (hiatus hernia) happens when the top of the stomach bulges through an opening in the diaphragm. This common condition causes few or no symptoms in many sufferers, and they may be unaware"

The card would have had to be 6\" x 6\" and even though my standard size is 5.5\" x 5.5\" it just looked huge. So.....I decided to cut Faith out and trim the card down to a more balanced size. It now measures 4.75\" x 6\". Odd I know but it looks much better.\nMy Mo's DT sistah Franz suggested I might want to add more photos like some close ups to my posts so here's a closer view of Faith.\nI'll be back tomorrow with a fun card for the new challenge at Mo's Digital Pencil.

When you\u2019re a child and you confront that truth for the first time, it throws you for a loop. You become more advanced in responding to it as you get older, but you\u2019ll never be 100% prepared. You utilize different measures to cope and depending on the source, you\u2019ll have a degree of success. But, there are no foolproof ways to guard our lives and hearts from the hardship of inconsistencies, the ones that come to you through people, or circumstances. You know what I mean.\nSo, I advocate for faith in God because I know it is the only way to obtain stability. The crazy thing is, that it requires doing something that is seemingly unstable. Without traditional proof, the person who decides to rely on God, makes a questionable decision. They decide take to heart the words that He preserved in the Scriptures and actually trust that everything in there is true. To believe that the Cross is the culmination of His Plan to love us past this life, and into the best life, which is eternal. It is a very risky thing to do. Initially, you\u2019ll wonder if He really will bring the consistency that you need. But, you have to know that in order to achieve that, our minds and our hearts have to be elevated spiritually and they have to remain that way because the contradictions are present here.\n\u201cSet your minds on things above, not on earthly things.\u201d Col 3:2.\nYou have to be capable of looking past the situation in order to understand that God\u2019s got this and your coping mechanisms can\u2019t cut it.

Some believers may not agree, but I think faith can still exist even as we take scientific facts into consideration. \n\u201cSee to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ.\u201d Colossians 2:8.\nKind of sounds like a contradiction, right? Not from an elevated mind stance that believes the One who made the world can bypass the world.

The expectation has always been that Ilkley would remain the focus for the valley. If this is not going to be the case warning and preparation time should have been built in.\"\nLast year, Cllr Hinchcliffe unveiled a four-year outline budget including plans to slash \u00a382m from Council accounts by 2020, with an aim to ensure the authority is sustainable when Revenue Support Grants from the Government end.\nIn 2013-14, the Council received \u00a3183m via that funding stream but the figure will drop to zero in 2020-21.\nCllr Hinchcliffe said that due to \u201crising demand for services and rising costs\u201d, the authority had been forced to re-visit its plans to find new savings.\n\u201cAs a Council, since 2010 we\u2019ve reduced our spending by \u00a3256m,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIn this year\u2019s budget, we are faced with a new gap of \u00a37.1m for 2018-19, and another \u00a323.6m gap in 2019-20.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to prevent compulsory redundancies since the Government\u2019s austerity programme started, however in recent years redundancies have become unavoidable.\nCllr Hinchcliffe and Stuart McKinnon-Evans, the authority\u2019s strategic director - corporate services, did not confirm which Council departments would be affected by the potential job losses, but said that \u201cextensive consultations\u201d with staff involved would start immediately.\nThe biggest proposed saving for 2018-19 is a further cut to street cleaning and public toilets, with the service set to lose more than \u00a31m. Library services will be slashed by \u00a3950,000, with the museum and galleries budget set to be reduced by \u00a3260,000.\nAsked about the closure of any library or museum sites, Cllr Hinchcliffe said: \u201cThat is a last resort obviously.\nDiscussing Council Tax, Cllr Hinchliffe said that, as indicated in February, the authority had \u201cno choice\u201d but to raise the tax by 1.99 per cent and implement the social care levy by the Government\u2019s stated maximum of three per cent.\nCllr Hinchcliffe also used the budget briefing to announce details of three new investment strands - costing a total of \u00a3750,000 - set to begin in April next year.\nFocusing on housebuilding and development, the growth of more business premises, and a new asset investment strategy, Council officers will be tasked with replenishing the authority\u2019s investment over a five-year period, bringing in additional income to spend on Council services.\nThe budget proposals will be discussed by the Council\u2019s Executive group on December 5 before going out to public consultation until January 28.<|endoftext|>Free Wi-Fi, an on-site bar and restaurant, and airport shuttle service entice guests at the non-smoking Days Hotel Jeju Seogwipo Ocean.

Although the diagnosis of the mass was accidental and the patient did not show dysphagia and/or any other symptom directly attributable to the presence of a cyst, the surgical intervention was chosen, in agreement with the studies reported in literature, considering not only the possible infectious complications, but also the potential increase in volume resulting in the compression of the esophagus and/or the bronchial tree, as well as some cases of malignant degeneration also in asymptomatic patients.\nThe nasogastric tube was kept for 7 days so as to favour the healing process while keeping the esophagus at rest. Liquids were administered through the tube starting from the recovery of the normal bowel function, followed by enteral nutrition supply until the 7th day. The removal of the tube was performed on the 8th day, liquids were administered orally, then a semi-liquid diet with the progressive addition of solid foods was followed in order to gradually resume the esophageal peristaltic activity and reduce the risk of developing an esophageal diverticulum in the surgical site.\nThe patient was discharged on the 12th day, without any complication and with a free diet. The radiological examination performed one month after the surgical intervention showed a regular peristaltic activity and a perfect recovery of the esophagus function without any alteration of its profile.\nParaesophageal bronchogenic intramural cyst was rare and had to be completely removed to prevent relapses. The combined use of VATS and esophagoscopy is the best choice in the treatment of such special cases. The intervention took place without any complication, and the postoperative course was excellent, thus showing that the VATS may be considered the best choice also in the treatment of rare cases.

Science now shows that human beings have on average between 60,000 and 70,000 thoughts per day and according to author Joe Dispenza, roughly \u201c70% of those thoughts are negative in nature.\u201d Negative thoughts create negative emotions which over time neurologically create redundant behaviors such as rushing, nervousness, preoccupation with the future as well as the past. How is it then, that anxiety could be a gift?\nThe truth is the actual symptoms itself may not be a gift, however the experience of the symptoms are. It turns out thoughts and emotions are made up of energy. They are simply molecules and atoms in motion. These send off a vibrational frequency. When the frequency is low (has little movement) this corresponds to low level emotions such as fear, insecurity and guilt. When the frequency is high (more movement) this corresponds to higher emotions such as courage, love and appreciation. This information has been scientifically tested and validated by scientists and clinicians such as Dr. David Hawkins.\nThis information allows us to approach, interpret and treat the symptoms of anxiety in a new way. Rather than attempt to beat, cure, prevent or control the symptoms the focus becomes on learning how to convert lower vibrational emotions into higher ones. This creates quite a shift in the field of psychology not only in the role of a therapist but also for the client. When applied consistently techniques such as visualization, mindfulness, and breathing have proven to transform emotions such as fear and worry into faith. As this occurs, new interpretations and insights develop. Similar to receiving clues in a board game symptoms become assets rather than barriers. For example, an emotion such as shame when released from the body has the capacity to uncover the gift of empathy.\nTransforming emotions such as guilt into courage can be quite rewarding however, as stated in The Four Gifts of Anxiety \u201ca life with your gifts does not mean a life without challenges, vulnerability or pain. Instead, a life with your gifts allows you to become empowered by the very same symptoms you once believed disempowered you.\u201d The symptoms of anxiety when viewed in this light become a guidepost rather than a barrier. Rather than being a signal for what is wrong, think of a symptom such as increased heart rate as a marking of a buried treasure (in this case a buried emotion) waiting to be discovered.\nThrough skill development and awareness one can begin to surrender the stigmas and stereotypes anxiety has formally attached to. Some of these include subconscious beliefs that you have anxiety rather than a reflection of your current experience (I am experiencing worry). It is not until each and every one of us breaks the habit of becoming our symptoms, instead choosing to pay attention to how they may in fact be our greatest ally, as they often point out exactly which emotions are looking to be acknowledged and cleared so we may open up the pathway to our gifts.\nDispenza, Joe Ph.D. (2014) You Are the Placebo.

Warsaw.\nWho takes blender on vacations? They do. That is why these girls were just meant for each other.\nA tiny place located in the basement in Pozna\u0144ska Street. Tight but in an excellent location in the very centre of gastronomic Warsaw. So far there has been a deficiency of a proper place for breakfasts. Kasia Knio\u0142a and Marzena Jarczak have filled this gap.\nCreative visual identification with a yellow dot which resembles the sun so missed during this season lures you to step inside. The yellow dot is also present on bottles with cocktails; there are also cushions in a shape of a yellow circle on which one can sit comfortably on stairs. From this place, you have a clear view on a bar and hosts who mix and cook oatmeals. Somehow everyone unconsciously starts chatting. Like during a breakfast at the common table. And this is how life should look like.\nMarzena is a breakfast freak. Even when she has to leave home at 7 AM, she gets up early enough to spend 30 minutes on eating her oatmeal or millet porridge. These are her favourite dishes. She could eat them all around the clock. She calls them comfort food and claims that this is a type of meal which supplies you with energy for a whole day.\nSimilarly Kasia talks about her cocktails. Her Detoxikate company has been on the market for two years now and is well known to the Warsaw residents who use her cocktails to make detox treatments. However, her mixtures don\u2019t taste like a regular medicine even though they are good for your health. Don\u2019t be afraid of the ingredients: kale, spirulina, spinach, barley, flax seed, beetroot, because in a company of apple, mango, banana, strawberry, tangerine or peanut butter they all taste delicious.\nBoth girls worked as models and they realize that healthy diet is the key, that you have to take care of yourself in that everyday rush. So find some time from 7 AM to 2 PM, visit them in Pozna\u0144ska Street and have at least a take-away. Let\u2019s be good for ourselves!<|endoftext|>Inderpal S.

Consumers are paying closer attention to their inner circles, often made up of close family and friends.\nOver half of consumers (56 per cent) say that their favourite type of influencer to follow on social media is \u201cthe everyday influencer\u201d, according to a study commissioned by user generated content specialist Bazaarvoice. These social media users include friends and family members, plus trusted online friends they may never have met. This kind of influencer is trusted because they either are or feel like a personal connection, as opposed to aspirational influencers and celebrities, who were more popular pre-pandemic.\nOver the last 18 months, a desire for more trusted, intimate connections is also impacting luxury retail, with an increase in one-to-one services. \u201cThroughout the pandemic our personal shopping service for our top customers became more popular and important than ever,\u201d says Sabah Naqushbandi, global marketing director at Mr Porter.\nGoing forward, richer and more personalised engagement is here to stay. Operating within the timely intersections of personalisation and social commerce, brands and retailers have the opportunity to create communities for and have conversations with customers. Among luxury brands such as Mr Porter, Telfar and Vestiaire Collective, global payments and shopping service Klarna is answering the call for closer customer connections.\nBeing a more personalised brand goes beyond knowing what your customer cares about. Brands must build a peer-to-peer community rooted in the societal movements that drive consumer values. For many luxury customers, the issue that acts as a bedrock for conversations and preferences is sustainability.\nPre-owned platforms are seeing shared values and purpose-building connections between peer-to-peer buyers and sellers. Vestiaire Collective, for instance, has \u201cevolved beyond a brand into a global community of fashion activists\u201d, says chief revenue officer Arnaud Collin. Increasing environmental concerns from the platform\u2019s community is contributing to the B Corp\u2019s growth. A 2020 survey by Boston Consulting Group co-created with Vestiaire Collective found that 70 per cent of pre-owned buyers like the sustainable aspect of secondhand consumption, up from 62 per cent in 2018.\nLuxury values align with a more considered and mindful approach to buying, leading to an increase in virtual retail spaces for intimate conversations and thoughtful purchasing discussions.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a clear shift in customer priorities and a desire to consume more responsibly with customers wanting to invest in high quality and timeless pieces,\u201d says Naqushbandi. Many of these pieces sit specifically within the luxury watches and fine jewellery category. This is increasing the need for specialised customer service in the category, rather than the use of intelligent algorithms or chatbots.\nThis means strengthening on-the-ground shopping teams across its seven geographical regions, as well as its real-time mobile interaction with customers.\nKlarna is expanding its portfolio of marketing services to mirror the consumer need to be met in person. Hero, a virtual shopping platform that delivers real-time, one-to-one online shopping experiences with a person in store, is helping to answer this desire for conversational commerce.\nActing as a growth driver for its more than 250,000 retailers, Klarna\u2019s acquisition of Hero recognises that peer-to-peer virtual shop assistants are also becoming the new influencers.\nApprl, a platform acquired by Klarna and now called Klarna Influencer Management, connects its retailers directly to relevant content creators with the ability to have results measured and tracked in a more impactful way. Sandstrom views influencers as an important form of human connection. Klarna itself is using influencers \u201cnot as a media channel but as a partner to curate content in the app\u201d, he says.\nCloser and more inclusive human connections are possible when designers are on the same side as the consumer. New York brand Telfar is an example of a brand that acts as a peer-to-peer influencer as it sits outside of the fashion ecosystem, according to founder Telfar Clemens. Telfar\u2019s \u201cBushwick Birkin\u201d has a more accessible price tag. At $150 to $257, the price point is designed to mirror the nightly wage an average person might earn DJing.\nDisrupting traditional notions of value, Telfar\u2019s direct-to-consumer retail model promotes feelings of delight and belonging for participants, with its buy-as-much-as-you-like pre-order drop system. Helping to make the designs even more accessible, customers can pay in four payments using Klarna. \u201cHaving exited conversations with investors, licensors and retailers, the Telfar brand is heading towards our own ecology and our own way of doing things,\u201d says creative director Telfar Clemens.\nThe latest step is the launch of Telfar TV, a peer-to-peer style live show that broadcasts fan-made videos and content. Via a \u201cdrip\u201d model (a smaller drop), it\u2019s also the only place where the Telfar community can buy the brand\u2019s new duffle bag.\nSandstrom believes power lies in the ability of a community to self-influence and sideways-sell. \u201cI think we\u2019re overly obsessed with brands connecting with consumers. We should focus on how brands can help customers connect with each other,\u201d he says, observing sales caused by a spike in peer-to-peer recommendations.\nHuge opportunities exist for sideways selling within existing circles. According to social listening service Relative Insight, comments on Instagram often now include words such as \u201csister\u201d or \u201cfriend\u201d, with influencers seen as or actually friends or family members. Gifts, an important shopping category at Mr Porter, is a key opportunity to create peer-to-peer selling within circles of families and friends. Sandstrom says Klarna is looking to harness the potential power of smaller or closed circles on social platforms:"

And welcome to this episode of Your Practice Made Perfect. My name is J. Baugh and I'll be your host for today's episode. Today we're going to cover a closed claim and we're calling this episode, jury's get good medicine and to help us discuss the facts of this closed claim is Stephanie Deupree. Stephanie, welcome to the show.\nBefore we get started talking about this closed claim, Stephanie, can you share with us a brief introduction about yourself?\nI'll be glad to. As J. said, my name is Stephanie Deupree and I am a senior claims attorney with SVMIC. I've been with the company almost 12 years. Prior to coming to SVMIC I worked as a medical malpractice defense attorney with a local firm.\nWell, Stephanie, thanks for joining us today for the discussion of this closed claim. Today, we're going to discuss a case involving a robotic Nissen and fundoplication surgery with hiatal hernia repair. Stephanie, why don't we start off with an introduction of the patient, the physician, and a bit of information about how all this began.\nSure, J. The patient, Martha May Randolph was an active 74 year old female with a history of esophageal stricture, GERD, and hiatal hernia. She presented to the office of general surgeon, Dr. Cameron Smith. Approximately one year earlier, Dr. Smith had performed a robotic Nissen fundoplication with hiatal hernia repair. Although Mrs. Randolph initially reported relief from her symptoms related to the GERD and hiatal hernia after her surgery over the last few months, her symptoms had returned and more recently worsened, hence her return to his office.\nYes, and I think it's important to note specifically that Mrs. Randolph had developed dysphasia, regurgitation, and odynophagia. These symptoms were increasing in frequency and severity. Eating had become very difficult and when she was able to eat Mrs. Randolph experienced early satiety and nausea. All these issues led to unwanted and unneeded weight loss of 25 pounds within three months.\nYes, J, definitely an important point. So Dr. Smith ordered a battery of tests, including a barium swallow and endoscopy. The test revealed esophagitis and a large recurrent paraesophageal hernia. Following the test Mrs. Randolph returned to see Dr. Smith. At that visit Dr. Smith explained to Mrs. Randolph that she needed a revision surgery. Dr. Smith advised that he only performed this type of revision surgery with an open approach. Mrs. Randolph did not want an open procedure and expressed her desire for minimally invasive surgery. Due to Mrs. Randolph's strong preference for minimally invasive surgery. Dr. Smith referred her to Dr. David Cowen, a board certified thoracic surgeon at a large metropolitan medical center known for his expertise with laparoscopic and robotic surgery.\nSo now we have a second physician involved and within a few weeks, Mrs. Randolph had an appointment with Dr. Cowen. During the appointment with Mrs. Randolph, Dr. Cowen reviewed her symptoms along with the available diagnostic testing results. Dr. Cowen concluded that the patient needed surgery, but before scheduling revision surgery, he ordered a gastric emptying study and cardiac clearance.\nOnce these items were satisfactorily completed and revealed no problems, Mrs. Randolph accompanied by her husband returned to see Dr. Cowen. During this visit, Dr. Cowen explained to Mrs. Randolph that she was a candidate for laparoscopic revision surgery. He explained to Mrs. Randolph and her husband, the difficulty of revision surgery illustrating the anatomy and how he hoped to repair it. In addition, he gave handouts pertaining to hernias and the laparoscopic procedure. They had a lengthy discussion about the risk, benefits and alternatives to surgery.\nIn addition to the lengthy discussion, Dr. Cowen also advised the Randolph's of potential complications, including damage to other organs, prolonged disability, and the risk of death. Nonetheless, Mrs. Randolph wanted to proceed with surgery. Dr. Cowen documented the informed consent process in great detail. And Mrs. Randolph was scheduled for surgery in one week. The morning of surgery, Dr. Cowen saw and examined Mrs. Randolph once again. She was given the opportunity to ask questions, but declined. After the examination and discussion, Mrs. Randolph signed a detailed consent form for the surgery, which outlined the significant risks and potential complications of the procedure, including organ damage and death.\nSo needless to say, this is a complicated surgery. During the surgery, Dr. Cowen encountered significant scarring and severe fibrosis. While carefully dissecting to the esophagus, he faced significant fibrosis and unusually distorted anatomy all the way. When he reached the esophagus, just under the pericardium, Dr. Cowen saw brisk bleeding coming from the hiatus. Believing there was a posterior heart injury, he immediately called for a stat cardiac surgery consultation.\nSo now Dr. Cowen did a quick laparotomy and placed his hand in the hiatus. Resuscitation efforts were initiated. Blood products were administered and the cardiac surgeon arrived within a few minutes. Upon arrival the cardiac surgeon performed a median sternotomy, which revealed an injury to the left atrium and pericardial tamponade. Despite the cardiac surgeon's efforts to repair the cardiac injury and the resuscitation efforts of the entire surgical team, Mrs. Randolph expired on the operating table. Dr. Cowen met with the Randolph family immediately after the surgery to explain what had happened and to offer his condolences.\nFollowing Mrs. Randolph's death, her family decided to sue Dr. Cowen and his practice group. Years of litigation eventually led to a four day jury trial. At trial, the Randolph's were able to paint a very sympathetic picture of a lady, much loved by her family and community. Prior to her death, Mrs. Randolph was still working part-time and was very involved in the lives of her children and grandchildren. Dr. Cowen's defense team never disputed any of this or maligned Mrs. Randolph in any way. In fact, the defense agreed that Mrs. Randolph was a lovely person by all accounts and her death was a sad, unfortunate event.\nYes, it is a very sad and unfortunate event Stephanie. I agree with that. As there was no question as to the cause of Mrs. Randolph's injury and death, when it was time for the defense team to present their proof, they focused on the standard of care. First, Dr. Cowen testified in his own defense going through his informed consent discussion and process. He also testified about the surgery with the use of anatomical exhibits to help the jury understand what he saw and did. Dr. Cowen's testimony showed him to be a caring and conscientious physician who had grieved the unfortunate loss of his patient, whom he had been trying to help.\nSecond, two fully supportive medical experts testified at trial that Dr. Cowen complied with the standard of care throughout his treatment. The experts were able to explain to the jury, the complexity of the surgery and how the injury could occur in the absence of any negligence. Their ability to walk the jury through the science and evidence was markedly different from the plaintiff's expert, who struggled to articulate his opinions in a clear and concise manner. At the conclusion of the trial, the medical proof as presented by Dr. Cowen and the defense experts along with Dr. Cowen's well-documented informed consent process carried the day. The jury returned a defense verdict, despite the very sympathetic nature of the case. Taking the time to document every step of the way through treatment ultimately helped Dr. Cowen prevail. The defense was able to show the jury, all of Dr. Cowen's documentation, including office notes, history and physical note, operative report and consent form.\nAnd Stephanie it's just so important to really highlight that these documents showed not only that Mrs. Randolph had been fully apprised of the significant risks associated with the surgery, but also that she understood and willingly chose to proceed with the surgery, knowing the possible outcomes. Certainly Dr. Cowen and everyone involved would've preferred a very different outcome. This case illustrates the importance of providing and documenting thorough informed consent, especially in the event of a bad outcome. So Stephanie, as we're getting ready to wrap up this episode, do you have any last minute tips that you'd like to share with our listeners?\nYes, J. I would. I'd like to speak to informed consent for just a moment. I cannot over emphasize the importance of good informed consent. These can be difficult conversations, especially when complex or high risk procedures are involved. Take the time on the front end, especially when it's a planned or elective procedure. Don't wait until the day of surgery. Look to Dr. Cowen as an example of communicating and documenting throughout the entire process. Don't forget the documentation should be part of the informed consent process.\nAlthough informed consent can occur in the absence of documentation, it makes it a much harder case to defend. Ideally, the provider should have a detailed note and a signed consent form that outlines the risk and benefits, alternatives, and potential complications. Notice that I said to include potential risk and complications. Sometimes we see that physicians have informed a patient of a potential"

With the help of myriad images and his funniest, most beloved cartoons, he traces his love of the craft all the way back to his childhood, when he started doing funny drawings at the age of eight. After meeting his mother, we follow his unlikely stints as a high-school basketball star, draft dodger, and sociology grad student. Though Mankoff abandoned the study of psychology in the seventies to become a cartoonist, he recently realized that the field he abandoned could help him better understand the field he was in, and here he takes up the psychology of cartooning, analyzing why some cartoons make us laugh and others don\u2019t.<|endoftext|>Heaven High and Happy Friday! How are you today?\nI hope you\u2019re well and I also hope you\u2019re optimistic about all the opportunities that abound in online video and video marketing. I was having a conversation on Skype with one of my subscribers the other day and he brought up what I think is a very interesting point that I\u2019d like to share with you.\nMy friend asked me how important I thought all this technical stuff was in comparison to just the person-to-person aspect of building a business online and/or offline. He commented that YouTube seemed to be changing almost as much, if not more, than Facebook and that it was hard to keep up and develop any practical plan for actually getting out \u2018on the street\u2019 and talking to people about his business.\nFor some reason, what he said struck a chord with me and we got off on a discussion of the role of self-confidence in marketing. As I told him, I\u2019m a big believe that \u2018attitude is everything\u2019. I\u2019m thoroughly convinced that no amount of \u2018video tips and tricks\u2019 or search engine knowledge is a substitute for the trust and friendship of one customer.\n Well, I believe that. And I also know that people like to deal with somebody who has confidence. That\u2019s because a lot of people don\u2019t feel confident today.\nIt\u2019s always been that way. To the extent that you can project confidence, people will have a tendency to want to do business with you and you can learn to act like a confident person.\nI\u2019ve written books about the subject of confidence and leadership and I\u2019ve got some great free videos on my website too at www.thommcfadden.com. That\u2019s my pitch for you to check out my Book \u201cActing for Real\u201c.\nI believe the mental side of success if by far the biggest challenge that most people have.<|endoftext|>Small scale feldspar milling plant 92 95 alumina ceramic grinding media mill ball crushing equipment made in germany dressing concentration mill plant concentrating vertical roller mill in gambia High quality professional ball mill manufacturers with CE stone crusher for waste our granite 50 260 Ton Per Hour Output Stone Impact Crusher Machinery pakistan steel prices of"

        "passage": " AV in 1674 when he observed squamous cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages in his preparations.[5] Donne published the first work on exfoliated cells of respiratory tracts in the year 1845.[1],[2] Walshe in 1846 showed the presence of tumor cells in sputum.[2] Hamplen in 1887 validated the cytodiagnosis by publishing a case report in which tumor cells recognized from sputum sample from a patient 5 months before the death and bronchogenic cancer were confirmed at autopsy.[3] Dudgeon and Wrigley in 1935 published a paper on wet-film fixation of sputum smears in a mixture of ethyl alcohol, mercuric chloride, and acetic acid for identification of malignant cells.[6] Johnston compared the FNA biopsy versus sputum and bronchial material in the diagnosis of lung cancer and concluded that the techniques of conventional respiratory cytology and FNA biopsy cytology are complementary in the diagnosis of lung cancer.[7] While the percentage of lung cancers diagnosed by FNA biopsy cytology alone is much greater than that obtained by conventional respiratory cytology, more than one-fourth of these cancers could be detected by the less invasive techniques of sputum collection and bronchoscopy.\nSputum is a most easily producible, noninvasive, and cost-effective sample for cytological analysis but with the highest rate of sample inadequacy and diagnostic inefficacy. Most of the samples collected are saliva only, without bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages, which were excluded from the study. The sensitivity of the present study is 6.00%, which is much low as compared with previously done studies of Dahlgren and Lind (64%) and Chopra et al. (18%).[8],[9],[10] Sputum cytology revealed 3.60% sensitivity for neoplastic and 8.99% sensitivity for nonneoplastic lesions. Jamal A et al. in their study stressed on adequate sampling, a major pitfall in sputum diagnosis which was the most important factor in the present study also.[11] The other factors for inadequacy were poor expectorating technique, peripherally located lesions and submucosal lesions and noncohesive and nonproductive pulmonary lesions.\nAfter the invention of bronchoscope by Gustav Killian (The Father of Bronchoscopy) in 1897 and advancement with flexible one, there was new era began in the cytodiagnosis of lung pathology which was least invasive, with better patient compliance, direct visualization, and sample collection from exact site with good cellular yield. Flexible bronchoscopes were more suitable for procedure as the entire structure of bronchial tree shows pulsatile and respiratory movements.\nBAL, TBNA, and BBs collected from the respiratory tract yielded a significant amount of cytological material with which the emphasis shifted from diagnosis of malignancy in operable patients and confirmation of metastases, to the use of cytology as a first-line diagnostic procedure on which crucial management decisions could be based.\nIn BAL technique, the sample adequacy depends on several factors, especially the degree of differentiation of malignant growth, preservation of the morphology of cytological material obtained, and technical skill of the pulmonologist who is retrieving the lavage fluid from the bronchus.\nChopra et al. in 1974 did fiber-optic bronchoscopy (washing, brushings, and biopsies) along with pre- and postbronchoscopic sputum collection in 70 histologically proved lung cancer patients.[9] Of all the various samples, brushings gave the highest yield of 67% followed by BBx of 66%. Prebronchoscopic sputum sample had the lowest yield of 18%.\nThe sensitivity of BB cytology in this study is 86.50% in comparison to Chopra (67.00%),[9] Sing (50.00%),[15] Gaur (87.30%),[16] and Mufti and Mokhtar (82%).[24] There were cases reported as bronchogenic carcinoma on radiology but showed tubercular granulomas on cytology and were confirmed on biopsy. The yield is higher with this study because of technical skill of bronchoscopist and direct visualization of the lesion. These studies also reveal that the combination of forceps biopsy and BB cytology gave best results for cancer in 57 cases (90.5%). Piaton et al. stated that biopsy is the cornerstone of diagnosis; however, the cytological materials may provide critical information on accurate typing of small cell and non-small cell carcinoma of the lung which is crucial in therapeutic and prognostic implication.[25] The present study has 86.50% positivity in comparison to 46.5% positivity of TBNA and 39.00% with BAL. This implicates the highest yield on BB. The advantages of the BB cytology are simple, rapid, and easy to perform with least complications as compared to biopsy. All lesions neither should be amenable to biopsy nor some patients should be fit due to compromised lung function. Combination of biopsy and BB is ideal for definitive diagnosis, but BB also gives equally good results as a biopsy.\nYe et al. in their study stationed the mediastinal lymph nodes according to the puncture site as the upper paratracheal (2R, 2 L), subcarinal (7), the lower paratracheal and hilar (4R, 4 L, 10R, and 10 L), the right paraesophageal (8R), and the interlobar station (11 L, 11R).[29] The sensitivity was 95.08% with predominance of cases involving 4R in comparison to the present study (46.50%).[29] The postprocedural complications are least with TBNA and include hemorrhage and mild pain only. The yield of the test depends on location of lesion and technical skill of the bronchoscopist. Peripherally located lesions may be negative on TBNA cytology but can be identified by transthoracic needle aspiration. Yield may be increased by proper visualization of the lesion and then taking the samples from submucosal lesions and lesions compressing the bronchial tree.\nBBx may be preoperative, either in the form of trucut or punch biopsy in which a small tissue bit was obtained to provide diagnosis and characterization of lesion and postoperative in the form of excision biopsy to know the diagnosis, extent of invasion, and nature of lesion. Puchalski in their study found that BBx classified 36.6% cases as poorly differentiated carcinoma, 29.6% cases as SCC, and 19.7% cases as small cell carcinoma.[22] The similar result was obtained in the present study also.\nThe aims and objectives of this study are met by assessing the diagnostic utility of sputum, BAL, TBNA, and BB cytology in the diagnosis of nonneoplastic and neoplastic pulmonary lesions.\nSputum cytology is the noninvasive, cost-effective, and easiest diagnostic technique but least informative hence cannot be used for diagnostic utility but is indicated in patients who are unfit for bronchoscopy and inpatients for their routine evaluation of underlying infection.\nBAL has a better yield than sputum cytology but less than that of TBNA and BB. The yield increases with repeated sampling and postbronchoscopic sample collection. Intraluminal lesions are positive on BAL, but submucosal and peripheral lesions give negative results.\nTBNA is indicated with increased diagnostic yield in submucosal and mediastinal lesions.\nBB is the diagnostic modality of choice in cytology for the diagnosis of lung pathologies whose sensitivity is next to the endobronchial biopsy. It is the least invasive, cost-effective diagnostic technique which provides earlier and accurate diagnosis, thus facilitating the early diagnosis and treatment of a patient. It also has prognostic values. In future, BB can be very useful in early detection of lung cancer.\nThe proposed protocol for cytomorphological diagnosis will include all four modalities, beginning with sputum > BAL > TBNA > BB in order of ease and should be performed sequentially for all cases. Gold standard, however, is by biopsy.\n1 Donne AF. Atlas of complementary microscopy course of medical studies.1st ed. Paris: Baillier publishing; 1845.\n2 Walshe WH. Diseases of lung.

Doing a Web search, he found that the related process belonged to a Windows management driver that, in turn, communicated with the server chassis' management controller provided by the server manufacturer. The two components were having difficulty in communicating, so the communication between them spiked.\nThe difficulty turned out to be that the blade server was not slotted into the rack appropriately. The user reseated the server chassis and the server quickly returned to delivering its Web pages speedily.\nAnother problem came not from misbehaving equipment or software, but rather from user behavior. \"This case came into the Microsoft Exchange support team,\" Russinovich said.\nUsers complained that Microsoft Exchange would periodically delay responding for up to 30 seconds. Microsoft requested the customer to log the server performance using Performance Monitor, which showed periodic spikes in CPU utilization. Using ProcDump, a Microsoft engineer created a script that would capture all the process information whenever processor usage went above a certain threshold.\nLooking through the results, the engineer found an Exchange search function was consuming many of the cycles. The sluggishness was caused by the fact that a number of users had humongous mailboxes, which when they searched through them, would spike the server load. The admin instructed the users to reduce the size of their mailboxes, or organize them better. As a result of such tidying up on the users' part, server performance improved.\nIn a third case, Russinovich's wife had complained that the Windows Photo Gallery would hang after showing a movie.

He matched the time of the hang with all the processes running at that time. While most of the processes were routine, he found an unusual system call, ironically enough, to an Apple QuickTime object, which was the source of program hang. \"Sure enough, it was from that company that doesn't know how to write Windows software,\" he joked.\nRussinovich also showed the audience how to rid a machine of a bad case of malware. This example also came from a user submission, detailing how the infected computer had a particularly thorough piece of malware that blocked all attempts to run any sort of diagnostic, anti-virus or system administration tools.\nOne way around the block, Russinovich advised, consisted of running another program he had written called Desktops, which lets the user set up four virtual desktops for the computer. The user can then switch among the desktops, each of which ran independently of the others. While not a diagnostic tool per se, Desktops could be used to repair the malware-riddled computer. The malware monitored any activity on the main desktop, but it was unaware of the other desktops, one of which Russinovich used to run anti-virus tools.\nFinally, no debugging session would be complete without diagnosing the infamous Windows Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) error. Despite the severity of the problem, \"It is incredibly easy to do crash analysis\" on a BSOD, he said. Russinovich explained that such a crash happens when something goes wrong within the operating system's kernel memory space, such as a device driver that tries to access memory allotted to another program. Because Windows' first priority is \"to protect data,\" it will shut down as soon as a program acts outside allotted memory space, he said.\nAfter a system crash, Microsoft will offer an analysis upon reboot of the machine, which can point to drivers that need to be updated or other fixes. Even if this help message proves unhelpful, the administrator can check for the crash dump file that Windows produces when it crashes, Russinovich said. This is either found in the Windows directory, or in a subdirectory called Minidump. A program called Windows Debugger can examine the file and provide more information about what possibly caused the crash.\nThe presentation \"makes you want to go home and crash your computer,\" one attendee said afterward.<|endoftext|>Osteophyte Arising From The Cricoid Cartilage Causing Dysphagia\n\nAlthough cervical degenerative changes is a common disorder, dysphagia induced by osteophyte formation is uncommon. We present a case of 54-year-old patient suffering dysphagia secondary to cricoidal osteophyte. Phsical examination showed no abnormality. A barium esophagography revealed anterior compression of the esophagus at the level of cricoid cartilage. A computed tomography (CT) showed a small spur originating from the cricoid. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated the osteophyte-induced edema and allowed the differential diagnosis with the other causes of dysphagia. In this report, radiological features of cricoidal osteophyte is presented.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThere are numerous pathologies causing dysphagia seen in various speciality departments. Some of these lesions are; esophagial inflamatuar diseases, motility disfunctions, diverticulum, benign and malignant lesions of the mediastinum, cervical spinal diseases and degenerative diseases of the vertebrae (1,2). Although hypertrophic changes of the cervical spine occur frequently after 5. decades, dysphagia due to the osteophyte compression is very rare (3)(4)(5)(6)(7). In this report, a very rarely seen lesion, which we could find no mention in the literature demonstrating osteophyte arising from the cricoid, as a cause of dysphagia has been described radiologically.\n\nCASE\nA 54-year-old male was admitted to our center with a three month history of difficulty in swallowing solid foods. Physical examination and laboratory findings were normal. His medical history was unremarkable. A barium esophagography showed anterior compression of the esophagus at the level of cricoid cartilage ( Figure 1). Axial computed tomographic (CT) scan gave vent to spur formation, three mm in diameter, extending from the cricoid cartilage to the posterior ( Figure 2). The sagittal reconstruction sections revealed osteophyte extending 13 mm caudally ( Figure 3). A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to rule out soft tissue pathology associated with dysphagia. Paraesophageal inflammatory change adjacent to the osteophyte was observed on MRI ( Figure 4).\nThe patient's difficulty in swallowing was thought to be secondary to the compression of cricoid osteophyte and osteophyte-induced soft tissue edema.\n\nDISCUSSION\nAlthough cervical osteophytes are common in the aging population, dysphagia is rare (4). 3000 cervical spines with degenerative changes were examined and only six of them caused dysphagia (7). Postulated explanations of dysphagia caused by osteophytes include; mechanical   blockage of large osteophytes, compression of small ostephytes to the part of esophagus fixed, or osteophyteinduced paraesophageal inflammatory reaction (1). The esophagus is fixed at two points, at the cricoid cartilage and at the diaphragm and the remainder of the esophagus is fairly mobile from the neck to the abdomen (8)(9)(10). Thus, at the cricoid cartilage, a small osteophyte can cause dysphagia (9,10).\nSome investigators believe that purely mechanical factors cause dysphagia. Other suggest that dysphagia is also caused by parapharyngitis or paraesophagitis in relation to the protrusion inducing fibrosis and adhesions (7,10). In our situation a small osteophyte arising from the cricoidal cartilage caused dysphagia because of its location and the presence of accompanying edema. Radiological diagnostic approach should include lateral x-ray films, barium esophagography, CT and MRI. The inhesion of osteophyte, its compression on esophagus, the craniocaudal and anteroposterior extention of it, and the adjacent inflammatory changes can be demonstrated by lateral plain radiograph, barium esophagography, CT and MRI, respectively (5). To reveal the cause of our patient's dysphagia, we used techniques above mentioned and were able to find out the findings of compression due to cricoid spur, accompanied by edema. For the treatment, conservative approach should be applied primarily. Surgery can be performed in the event of progression or to the distinct symptomatic cases (2,8).\nAs a result, a small osteophyte arising from cricoid cartilage can cause dysphagia by compressing, because esophagus is fixed at this location. The first method to be used in diagnosis should be lateral cervical radiography and barium esophagography. To show areas of osteophytic elongation or to detect of secondary changes to the degeneration CT or MRI can be used, respectively.<|endoftext|>\"...

She is working on her fantasy novel, Speak No Evil, and has won a Silver Key and two honorable mentions in the Scholastic Writing Awards. She volunteers with the Q?Crew at the Smithsonian Museum at Natural History.\nYesterday, a pit of fire opened up below my family\u2019s tent. In a moment, our entire life was swallowed up in a burst of flame. I rushed over to my former home, now a smoldering Hell pit. We didn\u2019t have much inside \u2014 only clothing and a few daggers to ward off the imps at night. Still, my eyes filled with tears as I stared at the pit. When Mama came back from battle, she muttered curses under her breath and kicked at the dust.\nPapa was still under the care of the healers, after the last battle fought in one of Hell\u2019s countless plains. After I helped clean up, I flew to the makeshift hospital to see him. The camp zoomed past, an array of tents and shacks, and in the distance, officers\u2019 barracks. Guards posted at the wall waved at me, and I recognized one.\nFlauros smiled, turning his gaze from the distance. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve seen dirt and a few tumbleweeds. No devils in sight,\u201d he sighed.\n\u201cAren\u2019t they mad though, after the last fight?\u201d I asked, looking out into the desert of Hell.  No demons marched over the horizon, brandishing swords. There was only the barren wasteland and the burning sun.\nI shivered, remembering the last battle. They had attacked at night, swarming over the walls. Devils wearing stinking furs and rusty armor, set fire to tents and soldiers. I hid in the officers\u2019 barracks with the other children. With every burst of flame, another scream rang through the night. We huddled in the corner, silent. I wished that my sister, Laylah, was next to me, saying that it would be alright. But she and my older brothers were gone, stationed in a distant outpost.\nBy the time we emerged from the barracks at dawn, the cries of the wounded had died down. How many of us became orphans that night?\n\u201cSorry about your dad,\u201d Flauros said, when I looked down.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, he\u2019ll be fine. Just a few scratches,\u201d I said, not mentioning Papa\u2019s delirious rambling and his rotting leg. At least he\u2019s alive.\nI lifted up the tent flap and ventured inside. The stench of blood and rot filled the air, and I tried not to gag. Injured soldiers groaned and cried out. I tried not to look at them, and stared at the ground. Healers tried to close bite wounds and repair charred skin, but it was no use. We all knew that the good healers \u2014 ones who mend shattered bones and grow new skin \u2014 were only for high-ranking angels. Papa lay on a stained blanket, healers bustling around him.\n\u201cHey, Abaddon, how are you?\u201d he said, propping himself up. His eyes glazed over. He stared in my direction, not really seeing. Papa\u2019s feathers were ruffled and bent. I smoothed them down carefully.\n\u201cFine, Dad. A Hell pit opened up under the tent,\u201d I said, tucking the blankets around him.\n\u201cYeah, healing up nicely. I\u2019ll be back in the fights before the week is up.\u201d He grimaced. Thick bandages covered his leg, soaked through with dark blood.\nA healer pulled me aside. She was from another rank, her robes a light, smooth blue. Her white wings glowed in the dim hospital tent. She smiled at me. I hated her, like I did angels of all other ranks. She didn\u2019t care about us.\n\u201cChild, is your mother in the outpost?\u201d she asked, her voice soft and lilting.\n Red dust coats every surface \u2014 clothes, weapon, skin. It seeps into the water, until each drink tastes like copper. The bread is hard enough to crack teeth and tastes like it was tossed into the dirt.\nEach day, soldiers battle devils. By nighttime, some return missing eyes, legs, wings. Devils lurk in the shadows, carrying clubs, swords, and spears. Beyond the outpost are untold horrors: lands crawling with monsters. I\u2019ve heard stories that beyond the desert, there are more demons than ever seen near the outpost. Kings and warlords rule over the lands, each more terrifying than the last.\nLife was hard, and devil attacks grew more frequent as time went on. When Mama and Papa were first stationed out here, no demons dared to approach. Now, it was getting worse.\nMy parents told me stories about Heaven at night, when the shadows descended on the camp, and the only light was from the campfire.\n\u201cEverything is beautiful, green everywhere,\u201d my father said, as if in a daze.\n\u201cAre there trees? They have leaves and bark, right?\u201d I asked. I imagined lying under a tree, resting in the shade. There was no rest in Hell. Only relentless heat, pounding down onto skin. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we in Heaven?\u201d I asked.\nMama laughed bitterly, breaking the silence she held all night. \u201cThey don\u2019t want us up there. We\u2019re not pure enough,\u201d she sneered.\n\u201cPa, have you ever been there?\u201d I asked him.\nToday was the battle. I kissed Mama on the cheek, where a jagged scar crossed her face. She was dressed in her armor, dented and dusty.\n\u201cStay safe,\u201d she whispered, as I hugged her. Dark circles ringed her eyes, and I remembered last night. It was dawn when Mama returned to our new tent, wiping the tears from her eyes.\nPapa is alright, I repeated to myself. He is fine.\nMama turned her back and joined her company. I watched her from Flauros\u2019 guard post as she disappeared into the desert. I sighed and turned away.\nI hated this. Why did Mama and Papa and Laylah have to fight battles for the other angels? Soon, I would too. Mama said that soon, I would be drafted, when I came of age.  It\u2019s scary at first, but then you can leave, leave the outpost where all soldier\u2019s children live, leave the dreaded frontier, and maybe even see Heaven.\n\u201cCheer up, Abby. Your Ma will be back soon,\u201d Flauros said.\nSuddenly, more angels appeared a few feet away. I\u2019d never seen anything like them before. Their golden armor gleamed in the sun, and wisps of flame floated from their wings. They carried fiery swords that radiated heat. They were beautiful. One turned and stared right at me.\n\u201cThose are Paragons. Don\u2019t look at them,\u201d Flauros said harshly.\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d I asked, glaring at him.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a child. I can handle it.\u201d I looked for the Paragons again, but they were already gone.\n\u201cWell, Paragons are a\u2026 different type of angel. I don\u2019t know too much, but before coming to this outpost, I saw some of them. In a devil village,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThey set the village on fire. I don\u2019t want to talk about it anymore,\u201d he said and turned away.\n\u201cIs there anything else you can do?\u201d I asked the healer, who was wrapping a fresh bandage around Papa\u2019s leg. She shook her head, and looked away from me. I sighed and got up. Being in the tent was stifling, and each minute grew more stuffy. I patted Papa\u2019s feathers and went outside for some air.\nI plopped into the sand just as two angels hovered by. I looked up curiously. It was Captain Jael and the heal"

As such, it\u2019s no surprise that a celluloid sequel is soon to hit our local silver screens, nor is it surprising that Telltale has used the ragtag group as subject matter for its latest adventure game.\nEntitled Marvel\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy: The Telltale Series, this choice-heavy original effort is based on the group\u2019s comics, though it also takes some cues from their movie(s). Through this, the aim is to appeal to all fans of the unique and comedic superhero quintet.\nFeaturing the familiar faces of Peter \u201cStar-Lord\u201d Quill, Drax the Destroyer, Gamora, Rocket Raccoon and everyone\u2019s favourite tree-like creature, Groot, Telltale\u2019s take on the Guardians has the potential to be great. However, as is always the case with such episodic games, it\u2019ll be a little while before we\u2019ll be able to see exactly how everything will play out.\nAt this point in time, all that\u2019s available to us is the first episode. Dubbed, \u201cTangled Up in Blue,\u201d it\u2019s an exciting opening that does a good job of showcasing each hero\u2019s individual personalities. The narrative, itself, is also on point, acting as a good set-up for what\u2019s to come.\nThings begin with a distress call from the Nova Corps, who summon the Guardians to a Kree planet where Titanian superhuman, Thanos, is causing trouble. There, the group faces off against the infamous super villain, who has come to the region in search of a mysterious artifact known as the Eternity Force. It\u2019s something that can best be described as a black, double-sided cup with green veins coursing through it.\nThe two sides battle in epic fashion, before the Eternity Force ends up falling into our heroes\u2019 hands. Then, things get both weird and dangerous.\nYou see, the strange relic that Thanos had his heart so set on has some rather mystifying abilities, and speaks to those who hold it. In doing so, it tries to lull them into a dream state, where it plays on their emotions. This is something that starts shortly after Star-Lord grabs it, causing him to go back in time. Saying much more would risk spoiling things, though, so I\u2019d better stop here.\nIn fact, with the way that Telltale\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy is structured, it\u2019s tough to really talk about the plot in Tangled Up in Blue without spoiling anything. Two major events occur almost right from the get-go, and it\u2019s those that really propel things forward, while also serving as the basis for the episode\u2019s most prominent choices. So, while I\u2019d love to say more, I really can\u2019t. What I will say, though, is that the events that occur set up what could end up being a very, very good adventure game, and the choices that you get to make are important from the start.\nIt\u2019s also hard not to piss any of your allies off in the process. Rocket Raccoon is especially hard-headed this time around, and he expects things to go his way. You can side with him, but it may risk the group\u2019s future safety. Or, you can choose to go with a much safer option, while having to worry about alienating one of your best pals and soldiers. Needless to say, no punches are held by such choices.\nWhat\u2019s best about this first episode, though, is that it does a very good job of capturing the Guardians that we fell in love with during the 2014 film. Although it\u2019s said to be based more on the comics than anything else, it does involve the Kree, who look to be this plot-line\u2019s biggest villains. Furthermore, certain character models \u2014 like Gamora \u2014 tend to look slightly different than film-goers will be used to. Gamora, herself, has been altered from the movie version, so as to include the well-known yellow spots that circle her eyes.\nIt should also be noted that, while all of the Guardians are playable during the battle against Thanos, it\u2019s Peter Quill who serves as Tangled Up in Blue\u2019s main playable character. Furthermore, everything that I\u2019ve read online supports him being our main throughout this series, though we\u2019ll have to wait and see if that changes with each subsequent episode. It does, however, seem as if he\u2019s been set up as the central protagonist, especially with the Eternity Force having called to him.\nRegardless, Tangled Up in Blue is an interesting, immersive and often exciting opening, which is well worth playing. From start to finish, it does a good job of both reintroducing and developing each of the individual Guardians, as well as setting up the new predicament that they find themselves in. There\u2019s lots of intrigue, some absolutely hilarious dialogue, and even a time of celebration where hardheadedness and too much alcohol threaten to get in the way of a good time.\nThere\u2019s layers to this story already, and I like that, especially given how narrative heavy Telltale\u2019s games tend to be.\nOf course, what we all love about the Guardians is the music and their references to yesteryear\u2019s pop culture. Thankfully, all of that is included, through some great musical choices that fit in perfectly with what\u2019s going on on-screen. The humour is also on-point, though this is just the first episode, meaning that more will be expected of the next four. This is just the beginning, after all.\nOutside of the music (and a great animated menu loop that is well worth watching through at least one), it\u2019s the voice acting that truly stands out. Nolan North, especially, as he does a fantastic job of portraying a pitch-perfect version of Rocket Raccoon. I honestly don\u2019t know if they could\u2019ve gotten a better voice actor for that part, because his portrayal is almost perfect.\nThe others (Scott Porter, Emily O\u2019Brien, Brandon Paul Eells and Adam Harrington) also do a very good job of breathing life into their famous avatars, despite Groot\u2019s inability to speak more than one line. However, while that one piece of dialogue is repeated quite often, and likely will be throughout this series, it\u2019s always uttered with different amounts of emotion, empathy and concern, with Rocket Raccoon offering translations of each one\u2019s meaning.\nThe downside, though, is that this is still the same old, aging Telltale engine that we\u2019ve become accustomed to. As such, you can expect some quirks and hiccups, mostly in the form of frame rate pauses. This is par for the course with Telltale games, however, and it\u2019s not a huge deal. The characters, themselves, do look quite good in-game, though, as do the environments. Most noticeable is how colourful things are, with the Guardians\u2019 models resembling those of a Disney Infinity game in some ways.\nOverall, this debut episode of Marvel\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy: The Telltale Series is a bonafide (and quality) step in the right direction. Although it has a few lulls here and there, it does a very good job of setting up what\u2019s to come, and offers a lot of intrigue in the process. It\u2019s the characters, their dialogue and the heavy choices that they must make which really stand out, though, in addition to some great sound work.\nTangled Up in Blue is a very solid, rather comical and thoroughly entertaining first episode, which sets Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy: The Telltale Series up for success.\nDoes a good job of capturing Star-Lord, Rocket Raccoon and co.\nIf you don't like Telltale games, then you probably won't like this one much.<|endoftext|>Free Online courses 2020 are offering by BF Technologies collaborates with the Women Development Department Under the Virtual Employment Azadi Program.

        "passage": "Stormies can take TWO special weapons.\nI know that. I chose to take one. Something wrong with that?\nNothing, it's just something that I noticed that not everyone notices. I thought that it was a good idea to clarify.\nThe culexus assassin's animus speculum's shots are increased by one when there is another psyker within 12\". Now it doesn't specify whether it is enemy psykers or allied psykers so all your psykers add +1 to the assault of the giant eye. Also each Grey Knight Terminator is counted as a psyker, as are justicars and inquisitors... so if you have, lets say 6 terminators of the grey knights and a brother captain within 12\" of the culexus you now have an assault 9 weapon S5 Ap1 and thats not including possible nemy Psykers. And as for the souless thing it doesn't matter to your fearless terminators and the only thing it does affect is the aegis. And that is why you give your inquisitor 2 heirophants and hide him behind terrain for that LD of 10 and a psychic hood that affects every power cast.\nSo what i'm saying is hide a Culexus in a squad of Grey Knights termies that don't have psychic powers, i.e. holocaust, and run them up and kill a big chunk of an impotrant and powerful squad and then finish the rest in assault with your Terms.\nAlso I believe that if you use Grey Knight unique rules like their hurricane bolters, which can move 12\" and then shoot, then you should abide to the codex Assault Cannon which is Heavy 3 S6 AP4 and nothing else. Again that is what I think.\nIm pretty sure Terminator armored people cant have Frags and I would find the points somewhere to give the GM a Psycannon.. he's BS 5 so you might as well take full advantage of it. Loosing the incinerator will get you the majority of the points you need for the Psy.\nAlso each Grey Knight Terminator is counted as a psyker, as are justicars and inquisitors...\nEach Terminator is not but the Brother Captain leading them is. Please see page 20 of the DH codex.. down near the bottom a little section named \"Psykers\".. Justicars and Brother Captains are the psychic focus of the squad and only they are counted as psykers. Inquisitors and the \"Grey Knight Heros\" have it listed in their profile.\nAlso Hurricane Bolters are not a unique Demon Hunter Crusader weapon.. all crusaders have the same weapon and before you even ask NO they cannot be upgraded with Psycannon bolts. The vehicle version of Psycannon bolts only works on Storm and Heavy Bolters.\nSomething cheaper than buying an Inquisitor and his 2 hirophant retinue is to just buy an Unguents of Warding for your squads.. its a 4+ save against psychic powers and can be used IN ADDTION TO psychic hoods and the Aegis. If you are going to take a psychic hood.. make sure its on a LD 10 model. The new Chaos psychers are all LD 10 so at best you have less than a 50/50 chance to negate it with the Psychic Hood but its better than nothing.<|endoftext|>Un 95 % de los hu\u00e9spedes m\u00e1s recientes ha valorado a \ucf00\ub2c8\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac \uc778 \uc11c\uadc0\ud3ec con 5 estrellas en comunicaci\u00f3n.\nIf you want a quick reply, please contact the front desk of the hotel directly.\n\"Good hotel I found.\"\nThe guest house and the hotel are the only two of the best.\nThis hotel is convenient, safe and reasonable for those who travel alone.\nFor those who are uncomfortable using the room with strangers, I recommend you to have a quiet time alone.\nToothpaste & toothbrush and razor are on sale at the front desk.\nThere are Olleh Market, Leejoongseob streets, and Cheonjiyeon Falls within walking distance.\nIt's easy to use the bus because it's downtown.\nThere is a Jungmun Tourist Park 20 minutes away by car.<|endoftext|>Search among 10 available hotels and places to stay in Tocumen from 50+ providers.\nLocated 13 km from Templo Baha'i, this villa features a terrace with the cathedral views.\nFeaturing a plunge swimming pool, this venue offers 6 rooms right in a busy area.\nThis hotel offers a plunge swimming pool and the possibility of trying canoeing, hiking and fishing services.\nSan Francisco de la Caleta Church is 2.7 miles from this villa that offers 2 bedrooms along with a kitchen.\nOffering 1 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a kitchen, this apartment is set 5 minutes' walk from the city center.\nLocated about 2.4 miles from Trail to las cascadas river, the villa offers accommodation for 12 guests.\nThis chalet is a 5-minute drive from Capilla del Carmen and offers hiking and fisheries.<|endoftext|>Our Chandeliers are handmade at our factory in Orange, CA.

Most of them are asymptomatic patients and may be discovered incidentally; others may be symptomatic and their presentation differs depending on hernia type.\nWe present the case of a 65-year-old woman, complaining of abdominal pain and vomiting. CT-scan showed a giant hiatal sliding hernia with almost the whole stomach in an intrathoracic position. Surgery was put forward to the patient for HH correction and Nissen procedure and she accepted it.\nAlthough a uniform definition does not exist, a giant HH is considered a hernia which includes at least 30% of the stomach in the chest. Usually, a giant HH is a type III hernia with a sliding and paraesophageal component, and consequently patients may complain of pain, heartburn, dysphagia, and vomiting. Surgery ordinarily includes four steps: hernia sac dissection and resection, esophageal mobilization, crural repair, and fundoplication. To prevent tension due to a large hiatus, relaxation of the diaphragmatic crura can be associated with the use of a mesh. However, mesh use is still a matter of debate because of severe associated complications, such as erosions requiring gastric resection. In this case, we decided to deliberately make a pleural incision, in order to reduce tension preventing the use of a mesh with all of its potential complications. This procedure, already described by some authors, is not associated with respiratory complications because of the difference in abdominal and respiratory pressures observed in laparoscopic surgery. The patient progressed favorably and was discharged asymptomatically on postoperative day 2.\nMesh use in the laparoscopic repair of hiatal hernia is associated with fewer recurrences. However, it may cause some complications such as dysphagia, stenosis or even erosion with esophageal or gastric migration.\nA 61-year-old woman with a large type III hiatal hernia underwent a laparoscopic Toupet fundoplication with closure of the hiatal crura with a dual U-shaped mesh.\nShe was symptom-free for 1 year, subsequently developing dysphagia and weight loss. An esophagogastric barium test revealed minimal contrast passage and endoscopy showed partial intragastric mesh migration.\nThe patient was submitted to a laparoscopic removal of migrated mesh with a transgastric approach. Hiatus inspection demonstrated significant fibrosis, with plication integrity and no evidence of recurrent hernia. A gastrotomy was performed allowing to identify and remove a migrated intra-gastric mesh. Careful evaluation did not show any gastric fistula and pressure test with methylene blue showed no evidence of leak.\nThis unusual approach avoided hiatus dissection, decreasing the risks of local complications such as perforation and bleeding. The patient had no postoperative complications, recovered well, and remained asymptomatic.\nIn this key lecture, Dr. DeMeester looks into the prevention and treatment of the side effects following a laparoscopic fundoplication. He mainly covers dysphagia and gas bloat syndrome in post-Nissen fundoplications using different studies. He lays emphasis on LES physiology in pre- and post-Nissen fundoplication and provides treatment options for related symptoms.\nIn this video, we present a case of laparoscopic gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer. As compared to surgery for early gastric cancer, surgery for advanced gastric cancer should be performed with total omentectomy and thorough D2 lymph node dissection. To do so, an appropriate coordination of movements with the assistant\u2019s hand and use of gravity help to achieve an adequate exposure.\nLaparoscopic antireflux surgery is currently a common procedure performed in a variety of different hospital categories. In this lecture, Dr. Bernard Dallemagne presents the possible complications that surgeons may encounter when performing this procedure detailing therapeutic modalities.\nPatients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery had only two surgical options: conventional open surgery or laparoscopic surgery with multiple incisions. Single incision laparoscopic surgery may become the preferred method of the future. Patients experience less pain and quicker recovery. Patients also enjoy the cosmetic benefit of fewer visible postoperative scars. This video shows a SILS Nissen fundoplication respecting all steps of the conventional approach.\nRe-operative antireflux surgery represents a challenging and complex clinical undertaking requiring careful patient selection as well as a high level of technical expertise. The procedures themselves are associated with a high rate of morbidity.\nThis video shows a laparoscopic Collis gastroplasty and partial fundoplication for the treatment of valve slippage.\nThe video \"Giant hiatal hernia: acute presentation with gastric volvulus\" authored by B Dallemagne, S Perretta and J Marescaux is analysed by E Targarona, sharing in this way his own personal experience and highlighting the different surgical approaches available with tips and tricks.\nComplications related to prosthetic hiatoplasty for hiatal hernia repair are more common than previously reported with no apparent relationship between mesh type and mesh configuration. The aim of this video is to show a case of mesh repair complication.\nA 50-year-old woman presented with severe dysphagia and important weight loss one year after redo laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication with prosthetic crural repair. At re-operation, important esophageal stenosis and angulation was found arising from the key-hole-shaped polypropylene mesh with pseudodiverticular dilatation of the distal esophagus. The esophagus was freed from the dense fibrotic capsule surrounding the prosthesis and a myotomy was performed.\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is prevalent among patients with end-stage lung disease before and after lung transplantation. In addition to problems with the lower esophageal sphincter, systemic diseases such as scleroderma and cystic fibrosis can diminish esophageal and gastric motility. After thoracic transplantation, esophageal and gastric motility often are negatively affected by damage to the vagus nerve and certain medications. Remodeling of the thoracic cavity also may alter the mechanics of esophageal muscle contraction. After transplantation, fundoplication may improve pulmonary function and prevent complications such as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome.\nThis is the case of a 57-year old patient with scleroderma 8 months after lung transplantation for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The patient presented with typical GERD symptoms, not responsive to a high dose of PPI. The trocar placement is the same as for a standard Nissen fundoplication. The video shows each surgical step carefully and demonstrates how to correctly perform esophageal and mediastinal dissection in case of a previous lung surgery.\nThe video demonstrates the laparoscopic surgical management of an unusual case of postoperative dysphagia following a Nissen's fundoplication for reflux disease.\nThis video demonstrates the laparoscopic technique for repair of a large hiatal hernia associated with a supradiaphragmatic stomach.<|endoftext|>What is Kamagra Full Range 100 mg?\nKamagra Full Range 100 mg If you are suffering from ED then going the route of medicines for finding a cure to this nagging sexual disorder is common.

It is recognized, however, that obesity increases the risk of early recurrence (ROR) for other hernias such as inguinal and ventral and increases the morbidity risk of most surgeries. The impact of obesity on the morbidity of paraesophageal hernia (PEH) repairs has not been looked at. Our objective is to investigate the impact of obesity on post-operative outcomes after laparoscopic PEH repair in a large prospective database.\nWe analyzed data from a population based database of primary elective laparoscopic PEH repairs. Patients who underwent a laparoscopic PEH repair without mesh (CPT code 43281) and with mesh (CPT code 43282) were identified using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP) database from 2005 through 2011. Pre-operative factors including age, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) classification \u2265 3, smoking and diabetes were assessed using bivariate analysis (Mann-Whitney and Fisher\u2019s exact test). Multivariate regression analysis was used to compare 30 day outcomes including pulmonary complications, cardiac events, thromboembolism, sepsis, surgical site infections (SSI), post-operative length of stay and death.\nA total of 2834 patients that underwent primary elective laparoscopic PEH repair were identified. Those who underwent an outpatient procedure (459 patients), underwent emergency surgery (57 patients), or who did not have height or weight data available (9 patients) were excluded. The remaining patients were divided into two groups based on calculated body mass index (BMI): group I (<25 BMI, normal weight) containing 437 patients, and group II (>25 BMI, overweight and obese) containing 1872 patients.\nCompared to group I, group II was younger (60 vs 73 years median; p<0.001), with more diabetics (9% vs 5%; p=0.001) and with a greater female-to-male ratio (74% vs 67%; p=0.004). The 2 groups were similar in terms of smoking (p=0.576) and ASA class \u2265 3 (p=0.222).\nThe overall mortality in the study group was 0.7% with no significant difference between the 2 groups (p=0.523). The post-operative length of stay was 4.3\u00b17.1 days for group I and 2.9\u00b13.7 days for group II (p<0.001). The difference in length of stay remains significant even when comparing the patients having complications (p=0.523) in the 2 groups or the patients without complications (p<0.001) in the 2 groups. The increase in length of stay in the lower BMI group may be explained by the significantly greater number of the elderly in group I.\nOn multivariate regression analysis, group II patients experienced more deep and organ space SSI (p=0.023). Interestingly, superficial SSI (p=0.8), pulmonary (p=0.113), cardiac (p=0.605), septic (p=0.796) and thromboembolic (p=0.384) complications were not different between the two groups.\nOur analysis of short-term post operative outcomes after laparoscopic PEH repair using NSQIP database shows no increase in mortality in overweight/obese patients in spite of the significant difference in age between the two cohorts. While deep and organ space SSI are more frequent in patients with BMI>25, all other analyzed morbidities appear to be equivalent.<|endoftext|>Fixed (?): 296868 - Improved software update service with cross-session incremental downloads, new update-notification UI, and binary patches rather than full downloads of new versions.\n\nFixed: 292368 - Scriptable Hash Function API.\nFixed: 295265 - Reintroduce chrome registry overrides.\nFixed: 295247 - Allow extensions to ship plugin DLLs.\nFixed: 296463 - Update gfx/cairo to cairo 0.5.\nFixed: 295401 - Allow DHTML accessibility to be used in text/html.\nFixed: 290344 - Implement DHTML accessibility description relations.\nFixed: 294795 - Security hole.\nFixed: 289422 - Erroneous javascript Focus() function will break close of findbar.\nFixed 294231 - Clicking back on your mouse while viewing a PDF causes FF to hang (with fastback on).\nFixed: 292933 - Info popup box on tinderbox display wrong details (with fastback on).\nFixed: 291183 - FCKeditor crashes when clicking on \"Source\" button (since Aug 10).\nFixed: 290793 - Bookmarks menu doesn't scroll with the keyboard (since Apr 4).\nFixed: 295459 - Too wide box in this case since fix for bug 240276 (since Apr 29).\nFixed: 295596 - Regression: <a><li>foo</li></a> no longer linked (since May 20).\nFixed: 289263 - document.all.tags no longer working (since Aug 24).\nFixed: 295210 - Tab title different from window title on initial load at gmail (since Apr 29).\nFixed: 292464 - Event listeners added using addEventListener() listen only trusted events.\nWFM: 295732 - Extensions fail to install with unexpected error -203, for some users.\nFixed: 231048 - Download manager poorly renames existing files by incrementing number suffix.\nFixed: 266737 - Bookmarks Toolbar is blank/empty only showing chevron/\">>\" after being resized while minimized.\nFixed: 284515 - Viewing the options of an extension that has just been enabled makes extension manager unusable.\nFixed: 295237 - PrefWindowVs opened from Extension Manager lack pane switcher (toolbar).\nFixed (?): 292971 - Sort out the progress listener story with fastback/bfcache.\nFixed (?): 221824 - Themes should be RTL compatible.\nFixed: 258625 - Installer needs to gracefully handle missing talkback package.\nFixed: 230693 - Missing reload within view source window.\nFixed: 191919 - Opentype fonts with CCF are ignored.\nFixed: 118563 - [Windows] The new print properties dialog does not save papersize.\nFixed: 271496 - [Mac] both delete and del keys should delete bookmarks and history items.\nFixed: Several JavaScript strict warnings upon opening a new browser window.\nWith fastback on: 293234 - Animated GIFs sometimes freeze when going back or forward with bfcache.\nSince Jun 7: 297005 - Dragging of file in empty area of tabbox opens in current selected tab.\nSince Jun 4: 260549 - Right-clicking on bookmark in a folder on bookmarks toolbar loads bookmark and context menu.\nSince Jun 3: 296764 - Arrow keys do not move cursor in input fields with JavaScript disabled.\nSince Jun 2: 296803 - Drop down box disappears too soon when displayed above.\nSince ~Jun 2: 296413 - Tab key in print preview crashes Firefox.\nSince ~Jun 1: 296450 - DOM Inspector: Object DOM Node does not work anymore.\nSince May??: 295539 - Dialog boxes sometimes display with no text.\nSince??: 295673 - Cannot scroll using keyboard when div with overflow:auto and padding has focus.\nThis entry was posted on Tuesday, June 7th, 2005 at 3:31 pm\tand is filed under Trunk.

However, due to the risk of persistent side effects, this method remains controversial. Laparoscopic mesh-augmented hiatoplasty without fundoplication (LMAH), which combines hiatal repair and mesh reinforcement, might therefore be an alternative. Methods In this retrospective study of 55 (25 male, 30 female) consecutive PEH patients, the perioperative course and symptomatic outcomes were analyzed after a mean follow-up of 72 months. Results The mean DeMeester symptom score decreased from 5.1 to 1.8 (P < 0.001) and the gas bloating value decreased from 1.2 to 0.5 (P = 0.001). The dysphagia value was 0.7 before surgery and 0.6 (P = 0.379) after surgery. The majority of the patients were able to belch and vomit (96 and 92 %, respectively). Acid-suppressive therapy on a regular basis was discontinued in 68 % of patients. In 4 % of patients, reoperation was necessary due to recurrent or persistent reflux. A mesh-related stenosis that required endoscopic dilatation occurred in 2 % of patients. Conclusions LMAH is feasible, safe and provides an anti-reflux effect, even without fundoplication. As operation-related side effects seem to be rare, LMAH is a potential treatment option for large hiatal hernias with paraesophageal involvement.\n\n\nIntroduction\nLaparoscopic fundoplication (LF) is recommended as an adjunct to the surgical treatment of symptomatic large hiatal hernias with paraesophageal involvement (PEH) [1][2][3]. However, there are a number of undesirable fundoplication-related side effects, such as gas bloating and dysphagia, which occur in up to 58 % of patients [4,5]. Due to the presence of persistent side effects in about 20 % of patients, it is necessary to investigate whether PEH could be surgically treated without an additional fundoplication [6,7]. An investigation of a simple laparoscopic meshaugmented hiatoplasty without an additional fundoplication (LMAH) could answer this question.\nWhether an adequate anti-reflux effect of LMAH can be achieved will depend on the reconstruction of the hiatus and the durable fixation of the esophagogastric junction below the diaphragm by mesh reinforcement, thereby lengthening the abdominal part of the esophagus. The latter is an important criterion for ensuring an adequate function of the lower esophageal sphincter [8].\nThe major problem associated with simple hiatoplasties in combination with some type of cardiopexy is that, while they provide a good anti-reflux effect in up to 90 % of cases, they have reflux recurrence rates of 60 % in the long term [9][10][11]. Styger et al. [3] have also shown that after repair of PEH without fundoplication, there was a new onset of gastroesophageal reflux in 32 % of patients. Consequently, cardiopexy procedures have been rejected in favor of fundoplication. However, all of these data originated from the time before mesh augmentation at the hiatus was used to prevent recurrences of hiatal hernias and the consequent gastroesophageal reflux. Therefore, recurrences after LMAH may be prevented by mesh augmentation even without additional fundoplication.\nThe aim of the present retrospective cohort study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficiency of LMAH in terms of reflux control, side effects and recurrences after the treatment of PEH.\n\nPatients\nIn the present retrospective follow-up study, the records of 55 consecutive patients who underwent LMAH for the repair of PEH at Bad Saulgau Hospital between July 1999 and July 2006 were reviewed for details on the perioperative course and the outcome after a long-term follow-up. All patients gave their informed consent. The patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1.\n\nPreoperative assessment\nPreoperatively, the patients were investigated for the type of hiatal hernia with an upper-gastrointestinal endoscopy in 47 (86 %) cases and/or a barium swallow in 39 (71 %) cases. Only large hiatal hernias defined as hernias with paraesophageal involvement (PEH) were included in the present study. Additionally, the patients were screened for evidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which was present in a total of 38 (69 %) patients, as confirmed by upper-gastrointestinal endoscopy in 28 (74 %) patients, by barium swallow in five (13 %) patients, by symptomatic voluminous reflux in three (8 %) patients and by a positive proton pump inhibitor test in two (5 %) patients. If apparent, esophagitis was graded according to the Savary and Miller or Los Angeles classification [12,13]. The details of the hernias are given in Table 2. The main symptoms leading to the operation are summarized in Table 3.\n\nSurgical technique\nAll procedures were performed as described previously [14]. All herniated structures were first repositioned (Fig. 1a). After incision of the lesser omentum and the peritoneum at the hiatus, the hernia sac was completely reduced. To identify the esophagus, a 32 Fr esophageal bougie was used. After complete mobilization of the hernia sac and the distal esophagus, the hiatus was narrowed with three to four non-absorbable, multifilament sutures    Fig. 1b), and a circular 8 9 8 cm heavyweight (85 g/m 2 ) polypropylene mesh (Surgipro TM, Tyco Healthcare, Neustadt, Germany) was applied from behind around"

I think my flight was around $50/person, which wasn't too bad.  We were staying for 3 nights, so we had 2 full days to explore, and we also had decided to rent a car to drive around the island rather than relying on tours or public transit. Actually, when we went to rent our car, the workers were talking to another customer, and then later told me that the customer was some famous Korean actress, which was kind of cool even though I have no idea who she was hahah!\nWe had decided to stay in a hotel just a bit outside of Jeju city, which turned out to be a good idea because traffic in Jeju city was pretty awful for such a small little town. Anyway, it doesn't really matter where you stay if you have a car, since the island is so small, it's not that far to drive around the whole island.\nOur first stop on our road trip was to the Osulloc Tea Museum, where they had a variety of delicious green tea desserts, as well as some really nice green tea for purchase too. It's cool because since Jeju island is basically a volcano, the green tea is a little different because of the volcanic soil, not that I can really taste a difference.\nNext up, we headed to the Yongmeori coast, but it wasn't open to visitors since the tide was high, so we decided to come back later and head to Cheonjeyeon Waterfalls, which is actually a few waterfalls! It's really nice, and probably takes around an hour to see all the picture spots, and head back.\nWe had lunch in Seogwipo, where we had Korean bbq (again), but we tried the famous black pork of Jeju island - you can find it at many places on Jeju island. I can't really tell the difference between the black pork and regular pork, but it was super tasty nonetheless!\nAfter lunch, we checked out Jeongbang Falls, another famous falls on Jeju island. There is a third famous one, called Cheonjiyeon Waterfall (yes, very similar to Cheonjeyeon falls), but we didn't go to the third one since we wanted to see some other spots instead. All these spots had small fees to enter, but fairly low and reasonable, plus you got discounts if you were students or under 25.\nAfter that, we went to see Daepo Jusangjeolli Cliff, which is like the Korean version of Giant's Causeway (which I also really want to see). It's really cool, and is also formmed from volcanoes. Jeju island is cool because the whole island is basically just a big volcano, the main volcano is Hallasan, which is in the the middle of the island. Unfortunately, we weren't up for hiking Hallasan, it can be a pretty long hike (like 8-10 hours), and the weather was really hot and a little smuggy as well, so we didn't think we would be able to see too much nor did we want to deal with hiking in the heat. Anyway, these rocks were really cool, and the view by the sea was beautiful!\nOur last stop for the day was back to Yongmeori Coast. You can walk around the rocks when the tide was low, and it was high"

        "passage": " EUS-scope, was not a limiting factor. Our data supports, with a large number of LAG samples, the ability of EUS-B to visualize and biopsy this structure.\nIn the analysis of sensitivity of malignancy and the NPV a group of samples from 51 patients it was not possible to perform the 6-month follow-up to show if the sample was true or false negative, since in all of these patients systemic oncological treatment of the disseminated disease was given. This relatively large number has a big influence on calculations.\nCalculations of sensitivity and NPV were performed both with these samples calculated as false negative, worst case scenario, (NPV 34%, sensitivity 39%) and in a best-case scenario (NPV 100%, sensitivity 98%). The true estimates must be placed somewhere in between. This weakness of the study is balanced by the strength of being able to demonstrate the value of the biopsies in a large consecutive, unselected cohort of patients in lung cancer work-up.\nThe sample adequacy of 87% is in line with earlier findings for EUS-B-FNA as Crombag et al. (13) found a sensitivity of 86% for LAG lesions.\nThe EUS endoscope traditionally used by the gastroenterologist is excellent for the left and lower paraesophageal structures and structures below the diaphragm such as the LAG, whereas the EBUS endoscope provides access to structures close to the large airways (5,(9)(10)(11). It is known that EUS-B-FNA with the EBUS endoscope in the esophagus is useful as a supplement to an endobronchial approach for additional sampling of mediastinal nodes (5, [18][19][20][21] and the technique has also been shown to give assess to tissue samples from intrapulmonary tumors (22). There are several technical advantages in the use of a conventional EUS-endoscope compared to EBUSendoscope for the esophageal approach, e.g. better stability in the stomach and the larger ultrasound device. The barriers of use of the EUS-endoscope in lung cancer workup are that most pulmonologists are not trained using the EUS-endoscope and that it requires another investment in the department already performing EBUS. Of these reasons, EUS-B-FNA is quickly gaining ground in Europe. Currently, one single endoscope that combines the features of the EUS scope mentioned with the EBUS scope designed for both esophagus and trachea does not exist.\nThough inclusion in this study was consecutive, a limitation is a selection bias due to the retrospective design. Subsequent studies should include larger cohorts in a prospective multi-centre design including exclusively consecutive patients including prevalence of missed EUS-B-FNA procedures due to inability to reach, visualize and/ or sample the LAG.\nOur results underline that EUS-B enables the pulmonologist to biopsy lesions in the LAG and thus EUS-B provides tissue proof of potential M1 lesions below the diaphragm.\nIn the future, interventional pulmonologists should be trained in both EBUS-TBNA (15) and EUS-B-FNA as recommended in the guidelines (5). Especially EUS-Bguided biopsy from the LAG should be learned.\n\nConclusions\nLAG analysis in lung cancer patients can be performed safely with EUS-B-FNA. Therefore, its use should be considered in appropriate lung cancer staging cases. The single EBUS scope approach for both nodal and LAG staging provides obvious logistical and practical advantages.<|endoftext|>Artistic license means an artist is accorded leeway in his or her interpretation of something and is not held strictly accountable for accuracy.\nFor example, the director of your local theatre group might decide it's high time Shakespeare's Hamlet was staged with the entire cast walking on stilts. Obviously, this was not how they did things when it was written, but the director has an artistic vision and must be indulged.\nMusic sampling is a relatively new discipline, in which bits and pieces of other works are taken and compiled into a new piece. Samplers take (sometimes wild) artistic license with other musicians' works. In many cases, the sampling community will rate new pieces, and one of the judging criteria is entitled \"Artistic License.\"\nArtists are notorious for insisting on creating what they see in their own heads, and not necessarily what anyone else sees. Occasionally, as with Dadaism, artistic license is applied with a heavy hand, and the viewer is expected to keep up.\nThe Abstract Expressionist movement, Cubism, and Surrealism are also good examples of this. While we are aware that humans don't have both eyes on the same side of their heads, realism isn't the point in this context.\nThe painter John Trumbull created a famous scene entitled The Declaration of Independence, in which all the authors\u2014and all but 15 of its signers\u2014are shown present in the same room at the same time. Such an occasion never actually occurred. However, by combining a series of meetings, Trumbull painted a composition full of historic likenesses, engaged in an important historic act, that was meant to evoke emotion and patriotism in U.S. citizens.\nArtists often haven't the time, resources or inclination to faithfully reproduce historic persons or events in exhaustive detail.\nLeonardo's mural of the Last Supper has come under close scrutiny of late. Historical and Biblical purists have pointed out that he got the table wrong. The architecture is wrong. The drinking vessels and tableware are wrong. Those who are supping are sitting upright, which is wrong. They all have the wrong skin tone, features, and dress. The scenery in the background is not Middle Eastern and so on.\nIf you know Leonardo, you also know he did not travel to Jerusalem and spend years researching historical detail, but that does not necessarily detract from the painting.\nAn artist might have attempted to portray things he'd never actually seen, based on someone else's description. Before the use of cameras, a person in England trying to draw an elephant might have greatly misinterpreted verbal accounts. This hypothetical artist may not have been trying to be funny or falsely represent a subject. He just didn't know any better.\nEveryone sees things differently, artists included. Some artists are better than others at translating what they see onto paper. Between the initial mental image, the artist's skill, and the subjective gaze of the viewer, it's not hard to amass actual or perceived artistic license.\nEsaak, Shelley. \"Artistic License.\" ThoughtCo, Aug. 27, 2020, thoughtco.com/what-is-artistic-license-182948.

One of these is Tool. Despite being one of the most critically acclaimed experimental bands of our time, their progressively winded music - which some consider to be almost a genre in itself - has seldom landed on my review desk stamped with a different band name. It does happen on occasion, though and one of those occasions is \"Cognitive\", the debut album by Soen.\nSoen is an international supergroup featuring, among others, drummer Martin Lopez (ex-Opeth, Amon Amarth) and bassist Steve DiGiorgio (Sadus, Testament, Death, Iced Earth), who seemingly aren't afraid to plagiarise the Tool arsenal to an almost preposterous extent. Pretty much the entirety of \"Cognitive\" reads and sounds like \"Lateralus\"-era Tool, whether it's the thick bass lines, the progressive and inventive guitar riffs, the textured drumming, or especially the vocals by the hitherto unknown Joel Ekel\u00f6f, who takes more than few pages from Maynard James Keenan's songbook. So close is the similarity in places that one has to wonder whether a lawsuit isn't waiting just around the corner.\nThe good news, however, is that Soen can actually pull it off. \"Cognitive\" is easily the best Tool album I've heard that wasn't released by Tool. Songs like \"Canvas\", \"Fraccions\", and \"Oscillation\" remind us why Tool is so highly revered, even if they don't tell us much about Soen's identity as a band. Carefully constructed, slightly pretentious (in the arrogant sense) and intellectually challenging progressive rock that still manages to stay catchy and accessible comes at a premium these days, and given how Tool practically never releases albums (two per decade, what the hell), \"Cognitive\" is a welcome addition to the club.<|endoftext|>Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty requiring conversion to partial gastrectomy with paraesophageal hernia repair\n\nAbstract Endoluminal bariatric surgery has lower costs and perceived risks compared to traditional surgery. Endoluminal procedures are a newer approach to weight loss but long-term outcomes and complications continue to emerge. This case report is an endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty that resulted in a paraesophageal hernia repair with removal of gastroplasty sutures and partial gastrectomy.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\nEndoluminal bariatric surgery is an alternative treatment due to the potentially lower costs and risks. However, due to the paucity of research, it is difficult to compare the outcomes of endoluminal versus laparoscopic approaches to weight loss surgery. Outcomes for endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) are still being studied, and complications are continuing to emerge. Our case will discuss an ESG that resulted in the patient requiring a paraesophageal hernia repair with removal of gastroplasty sutures and partial gastrectomy.\n\nCASE\nThe patient is a 49-year-old female with a BMI of 31 kg/m 2 that presented with worsening dysphagia, pain, heartburn, and progressively worsening nausea and vomiting since her ESG. She underwent an ESG one-year prior with intragastric plication sutures, however, did not follow up with her surgeon. Associated Published by Oxford University Press and JSCR Publishing Ltd.

Age-adjusted (to World Health Organization world standard population) death rates for gastric cancer from 2000 in 45 countries for females (A) and males (B). Rates in the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom are compared with selected countries, including the 15 countries with the highest death rates.\nThe causes of the decline in the U.S. rates are incompletely understood, but environmental factors, chiefly dietary, are suspected. Within the United States the lowest incidence is in whites, Chinese, and Filipinos, with a higher incidence in U.S. Japanese. However, epidemiologists have noted a significant decrease in incidence among migrants from high-incidence countries (such as Japan and Chile) to low-incidence countries. Although there is an overall reduction in gastric cancer incidence, there has been a steady rapid increase in the incidence of gastroesophageal junction and proximal gastric cancers.\nFactors that have been associated with a higher incidence of gastric cancer include smoked or salted foods, foods contaminated with aflatoxin, low intake of fruits and vegetables, low socioeconomic status, and possibly a decreased use of refrigeration. Possible occupational relationships include coal mining and rubber or asbestos workers. Precursor pathologic conditions include pernicious anemia, achlorhydria atrophic gastritis, gastric ulcers, and adenomatous polyps. Between 5% and 10% of individuals with pernicious anemia subsequently develop malignancy. Prior partial gastrectomy for benign gastric or duodenal ulcer disease produces an increased risk of subsequent malignancy in the gastric remnant with latency periods of 20 years or more.\nSeveral studies have shown a three- to sixfold increased risk of gastric cancer in individuals with Helicobacter pylori infection versus those with no infection, but the precise role of this bacterium in the etiology of gastric cancer remains unknown. A variety of bacterial, patient, and environment factors most likely act in combination to affect the development of gastric carcinoma. The increased association of H. pylori with gastric cancer seems to be mainly with distal gastric cancers and intestinal-type malignancy. Only a minority of H. pylori-infected individuals develop gastric cancer, and data do not yet exist on the effect of treatment of the H. pylori infection on subsequent malignancy.\nEarly detection would markedly improve the prognosis of gastric cancer in the United States, because surgical resection has a high cure rate with lesions limited to the mucosa or submucosa. However, the incidence of such early gastric cancers is less than 5% in most U.S. series. In Japan the incidence of carcinomas confined to the mucosa or submucosa was only 3.8% in the 1955 to 1956 period. However, by 1966 the incidence of early lesions had increased to 34.5% because of vigorous screening procedures, leading to 5-year survival rates of 90.9% in this cohort of patients. Although mass screening has been useful in Japan to detect early cancers, defined high-risk populations have not existed in the United States in the past to justify the expense of widespread screening endeavors. Whether screening of individuals with H. pylori infection would be of value is not yet known. Individual practitioners should use upper gastrointestinal (GI) series or preferably endoscopy to screen patients who have occupational or precursor risk factors or individuals with persistent dyspepsia or gastroesophageal symptoms.\nGermline mutations in the CDH1 gene, which encodes the E-cadherin protein, have recently been recognized in families with hereditary diffuse gastric adenocarcinoma. Carriers of these mutations have a 70% lifetime risk of developing gastric cancer. Several reports of prophylactic gastrectomy have demonstrated the routine presence of microscopic intraepithelial carcinomas in patients having regular endoscopic surveillance that includes multiple random biopsies. Early total gastrectomy has been recommended for this small patient population because of the lack of effective early tumor detection by less aggressive techniques. Microscopic evaluation of the proximal and distal resection margins for complete removal of the gastric mucosa is necessary, because residual gastric mucosa can degenerate and result in a gastric cancer.\nThe terms gastric cancer and stomach cancer usually refer to adenocarcinoma, which accounts for 90% to 95% of all gastric malignancies. Other histologic types include lymphoma (usually intermediate- or high-grade histologic types), leiomyosarcoma, carcinoid, adenoacanthoma, and squamous cell carcinomas. The site of origin within the stomach has changed in frequency in the United States over recent decades, with more proximal lesions now being diagnosed and treated. The largest percentage of gastric cancers still arises within the antrum or distal stomach (around 40%), are least common in the body of the stomach (around 25%), and are of intermediate frequency in the fundus and esophagogastric junction (around 35%).\nGastric carcinomas have been categorized by using both microscopic (Fig. 3) and gross pathologic features. The Lauren classification system includes an intestinal type with improved prognosis that predominates in regions with high prevalence of gastric cancer, as well as a diffuse histologic type, with poor prognosis, which occurs more commonly in countries with low prevalence of stomach cancer. Grossly, gastric cancers can be categorized according to Borrmann's five types: I, polypoid or fungating; II, ulcerating lesions surrounded by elevated borders; III, ulceration with invasion of the gastric wall; IV, diffusely infiltrating (linitis plastica); and V, unclassifiable. The Japanese Research Society for Gastric Cancer has a classification system that divides lesions into protruded (I); superficial (II) with elevated (IIa), flat (IIb), and depressed (IIc) subtypes; and excavated (III) types.\nThe stomach is surrounded by a number of organs and structures that can be involved by direct extension once a lesion has extended beyond the gastric wall. These structures include the omenta, pancreas, diaphragm, transverse colon or mesocolon, duodenum, jejunum, spleen, liver, superior mesenteric and celiac vessels, abdominal wall, left adrenal gland, and kidney. Adherence from inflammatory conditions can mimic direct extension of tumor, but all adhesions between a gastric carcinoma and adjacent structures must be regarded as malignant.\nAbundant lymphatic channels are present within the submucosal and subserosal layers of the gastric wall. Microscopic or subclinical spread well beyond the visible gross lesion (intramural spread) occurs via these lymphatic channels. Accordingly, frozen sections of the gastric resection margins should be obtained intraoperatively to ensure that margins of resection are uninvolved microscopically. The submucosal lymphatic plexus is also prominent in the esophagus and the subserosal plexus in the duodenum, allowing both proximal and distal intramural tumor spread.\nBecause of the numerous pathways of lymphatic drainage from the stomach, it is difficult to perform a complete nodal dissection (Fig. 4). Although initial drainage is usually to lymph nodes along the lesser and greater curvatures (perigastric or N1 nodes using the Japanese Research Society for Gastric Cancer designation), primary node drainage includes nodes along all three branches of the celiac axis (common hepatic, splenic, left gastric) and the celiac artery itself (Japanese N2 nodes). Node groups that are more distal include hepatoduodenal, peripancreatic, root of mesentery (N3), periaortic, and middle colic (N4). When proximal gastric lesions extend into distal esophagus, the paraesophageal nodal system is at risk for involvement.\nFigure 4. Classification and anatomic location of lymph node groups. Involvement of nodes along the lesser or greater curvature (groups 1\u20136) constitutes N1 disease, and the celiac axis and its three branches are N2 (7\u201311), N3 (12\u201314), and N4 (15, 16). N1: 1, right paracardial; 2, left paracardial; 3, lesser curvature; 4, greater curvature; 5, suprapyloric; 6, infrapyloric. N2: 7, left gastric artery; 8, common hepatic artery; 9, celiac artery; 10, splenic hilus; 11, splenic artery. N3: 12, hepatic pedicle; 13, retropancreatic; 14, mesenteric root. N4: 15, middle colic artery; 16, para-aortic.\nFor malignancies confined to the stomach, venous drainage is primarily to the liver via the portal system. At initial exploration, liver involvement is found in up to 30% of patients, predominantly as a result of hematogenous metastases but sometimes because of direct tumor extension. For lesions that extend proximally to involve the esophagus or posteriorly, the lung may be at risk for distant metastases.\nBecause the stomach is an intraperitoneal organ, peritoneal dissemination is possible once a lesion extends beyond the gastric wall to a free peritoneal (serosal) surface. Peritoneal spread may initially be a localized process limited by surrounding organs and ligaments (gastrohepatic, gastrosplenic, and gastrocolic).\nThe most meaningful prognostic indicators relate to extent of tumor. With either hematogenous metastasis or peritoneal seeding, prognosis is almost uniformly fatal. Recent"

Possible GERD symptoms are belching, bad breath, inflamed gums and heartburn. Don\u2019t arch your back this is very bad for it. The LES opens when food passes throug and is meant to close and prevent acid from moving back into the esophagus. Sources of food that carry a higher content of oil such as many fishes (Omega-3) have anti-inflammatory characteristics which can be beneficial. Friends; they can support you on the way. I tried changing my diet and tried getting motivated to do a little exercise too and sure it started working, but way too slowly for my timeline. That way you will enjoy your meal knowing that you have eaten well.\nBecause these effects can be more subtle than the results of an automobile accident it isn\u2019t hard to see why some people dealing with chronic pain may go their entire life without ever knowing the exact source of their discomfort. If this condition goes undiagnosed and untreated, it can lead to more serious medical problems such as stomach cancer and cancer of the esophagus. We often associate chronic pain with the back, but chronic pain can also be a daily reality for people dealing with diabetes, glaucoma, arthritis, Fibromyalgia, cancer and many other disease processes. By focusing on what these cells need for proper structure and function, healthier tissues result from healthier cells leading to reduced inflammation, pressure from swollen tissues and a decrease or complete absence of pain. Tissue damage can result from a disease process, repetitive stress, or cellular degradation brought on by an absence of quality nutrition and poor lifestyle.\nChronic pain is often associated with tissue damage and inflammation. For many, the primary choices for dealing with chronic pain appear to be either narcotic drugs or sheer will power. 3. a real fat loss plan will help you understand your body. Most people have too much protein in their diets, the quality of the fat consumed is very poor and the water they drink is typically insufficient as well as poor in quality. We have known that cells require protein, fats and water to for basic structure. What do cells need for healthy production? Everything in the body is either made out of cells or made by cells. Feelings of deprivation are deadly to any diet plan, which is just one reason why diets that emphasize cutting out entire food groups are rarely long-lasting solutions.\nParaesophageal \u2013 this is where a piece of the stomach is located beside the esophagus and prevents food from entering the stomach.

Londo sends G'Kar to Narn and gets revenge on Lord Refa. Everyone else tries to cheer Sheridan up.\nREVIEW: An episode about the weight of responsibility people take on, responsibility one cannot hide from (as the title reminds us), but nevertheless a burden that can be shared. As ever, Babylon 5 is about how we do come together to withstand and overcome what alone we could not. The two story threads, unconnected as they are, share this theme. In what is ostensibly the character-building subplot, Sheridan is trying to carry the load alone, and is remonstrated by one of three spiritual leaders on the station who have come together, despite philosophical differences, to lend a hand, running information between the station and Babylon 5. And maybe offering a non-denominational service that brings everyone together and highlights the themes. Sheridan's reflex is understandable. He doesn't want to burden anyone else with his problems, especially not Delenn, but the pastor is right, sharing hardship isn't an additive process, it's a subtractive one. Pairing up with Delenn, he gains a second set of eyes that help him see where the Shadows might strike next, someone who calls him on his bull so he doesn't burn out or lose perspective, and the comfort of a lover's embrace (they finally kiss in the proper timeline). That, and she reveals a fleet of White Stars. Sheridan is not alone, far from it, and here's a visual to bring it home.\nOf course, the more engrossing story line is Londo's. He pretends to send G'Kar into a trap on Narn using Vir as a messenger, a messenger then intercepted by Lord Refa who uses a telepath to get the skinny on the plot so he can hijack it and reap its rewards. Except Londo hates Refa far more than he does G'Kar, and the trap is really meant for his slimy Centauri colleague. London hates him for killing his lady love and other friends besides, but it's more than that. Refa represents his own unbridled ambition and HIS part in the Narn genocide. It's the weight HE carries, and killing Refa... no, not just killing, but ruining his reputation with a frame-up, and in some small sense trying to undo some of his works by releasing thousands of Narns, all of that is atonement. G'Kar goes along with this because perhaps there's a greater villain than Londo, but he's really just a delivery device. This is Londo's show and he just stands and watches, taking no joy from it. When Refa is ripped apart by Narns, G'Kar doesn't join in. He just walks away. It's not in his blood anymore, and Ivanova is right to equate him to the holy men on the station. Though Londo may know some peace from this action - spiritually and physically - it might also herald some trouble with Vir, whose anger towards his mentor is born of the same sentiment, guilt by association.\nObviously, Refa was the kind of character you'd love to hate, so his death must be memorable. And it is. Refa deserves Londo's intricate and grandiose plot. He is the man who hasn't shouldered the burden of"

The program's director and FDNY top doctor David Prezant had seen parts of his payments to the program docked by the feds for a number of years. Although he asked repeatedly, he never got an answer as to why. When he was nearing $4 million in the hole, he reached out to me.\nI also got no explanation, since the government declined to answer me -- at first -- but I did get the documents showing the Treasury Department had seized portions of payments for years. So, I wrote the story describing the previously secret and mysterious dunning.\nThe press office did start talking to me when the story hit. First they claimed that it was not happening. Then they claimed it wasn't the Treasury Department. Then they admitted it was, but that it was the Department of Health and Human Services that asked for it. They said that Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin couldn't do anything about it.\nEventually, I figured out the true part of their argument was that HHS did in fact start the problem by flagging payment disputes that the feds had with various city providers in the Medicare program. Under a law signed during the Clinton administration, Treasury collects such debts by docking payouts to local governments.\nThat is what was happening here, though the notifications never made their way to Dr. Prezant.\nThe Treasury Department said there was nothing Mnuchin could do about it, but I also found a portion of that law that says the secretary does in fact have discretion regarding these payment seizures. I confirmed that by interviewing one of the law's authors -- Rep. Carolyn Maloney. She was not at all pleased that Treasury was dinging the FDNY's 9/11 Health Program.\nThere were a bunch of stories along the way, and outrage by New York lawmakers. Mnuchin ultimately caved, and gave most of the money back -- $3.3 million -- and made sure the ill first responders would not be targeted in the future.<|endoftext|>Teachers play an important role in introducing new generations to the wonders of the arts.

Hiatal hernia surgery resolves this tear or weakness and strengthens the affected muscular walls. Generally, a hernia causes no symptoms. However, as the condition progresses, it can cause gastrointestinal reflux disease. This causes food and acid to go back up into your esophagus, thus necessitating surgery.\nRead on to learn more about hernia surgery.\nHowever, surgery is not the first option. Your doctor may recommend medications and lifestyle changes to treat the hernia. If they fail to work, surgery will be considered.\nSliding Hiatal Hernia (Grade one) \u2013 The stomach freely moves in and out of the chest cavity. It may or may not cause symptoms.\nParaesophageal Hernia (Grade four) \u2013 The stomach moves permanently out of position, causing interruptions in blood supply and ulcers.\nWho Are Good Candidates for Hiatal Hernia Surgery?\nYour doctor may recommend these tests to diagnose a hiatal hernia and determine its severity.\nBarium swallow/upper GI X-ray \u2013 X-rays are taken after you drink a special liquid that magnifies imaging. This test helps to assess the hernia\u2019s size and scale.\n24 Hour pH Test \u2013 This determines acidity levels and damage in the esophagus using a catheter that is connected to a computer for monitoring. Patients should be continuously monitored for 24 hours to get the full picture.\nEndoscopy \u2013 This provides real-time video of the hernia using an endoscope.\nEsophageal Manometry \u2013 This involves a small, thin catheter that measures the muscle contractions in your esophagus when you swallow.\nHiatal hernia surgery is a safe and effective procedure. Though there are complications, minimally-invasive techniques used today have reduced the risks associated with the surgery. The UK\u2019s National Health Service reveals that 85% to 90% of patients are satisfied with this surgery. This procedure can effectively treat GERD and hernia symptoms, improving your health and wellness for a long period.\nFor more information on hiatal hernia surgery, contact us today.<|endoftext|>Machine sewn or hand sewn, or no-sew, store bought and decorated or made with your own hands.

Nowadays, the electronic camera is small and can be concealed in simply about anything. Clocks, MP3 players, radios, smoke detectors, air purifier and even an electrical wall outlet are a few of the products you can purchase with a camera placed in it. With advances in technology and cordless abilities, the electronic camera can nearly go unnoticed, because there is an endless opportunities where to put them.\nFire: Fire is one of the leading causes of home destruction. Given that fires are harmful, you can increase home security by finding out how fires are begun and what you can do to avoid fires from occurring. It is necessary that you teach your children to never ever, play with fire. Matches, lighters, etc, are grown up tools. The tools are not toys. When they see somebody playing with matches or lighters, you need to teach your kids to inform adults.\nAvoid any apparent places where a thief can discover cover while he attempts to acquire entry to your home. This means if there are bushes surrounding windows, it\u2019s most likely a great concept to trim them.\nThe homeowner then has to install the magnetic turn on all of those doors and windows that a possible trespasser can force entry. These switches are consisted of 2 parts\u2013 a magnet and a switch\u2013 and are simple to install. Your house owner need to just make sure that the range between the switch and the magnet is not so large regarding permit the trespasser to stroll in undetected. When the distance between the magnet and the switch boosts, the alarm must go off.\nThis is a really a fantastic feature in an electronic camera. However a PTZ cam does not fix all your surveillance problems. We have actually seen many security camera installation that depend too greatly on their PTZs. One apparent concern is that the function is just useful if a person is readily available to adjust the ptz and keep an eye on as required. Some setups set up their PTZ video camera to instantly pan backward and forward. But that doesn\u2019t assist much if an occasion takes place outside of the camera\u2019s field of view at any specific moment. Another choice to address this problem is an \u2018autotracking\u2019 feature which uses analytics to instruct the camera to focus and track in on motion within its field of view. However the autotracking performance is not fool-proof, and adds cost.\nMake certain the frame is extremely sturdy \u2013 a door is only as great as its frame.

        "passage": " emission computed tomography and computed tomography were correlated with pathology findings after surgery. RESULTS: Single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography correctly identified six out of 19 cases involving hilar lymph nodes and one out of seven cases involving nodal metastases in the mediastinum. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for 99mTc-sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography in the hilum assessment were 31.6%, 95.5%, 85.7%, and 61.8%, respectively. The same values for the mediastinum were 14.3%, 97.1%, 50%, and 84.6%, respectively. For the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, chest tomography showed sensitivity values of 47.4% and 57.1%, specificity values of 95.5% and 91.2%, positive predictive values of 90% and 57.1% and negative predictive values of 67.7% and 91.2%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography with 99mTc-sestamibi showed very low sensitivity and accuracy for the nodal staging of patients with non-small cell lung cancer, despite its high level of specificity. In addition, the performance of single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography added no relevant information compared to computed tomography that would justify its use in the routine preoperative staging of non-small cell lung carcinoma.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe survival of lung cancer patients is related to the extent of their disease at the time of diagnosis. In the absence of distant metastases, the spread of tumors to the mediastinal lymph nodes is a major determinant of both the prognosis and the therapeutic approach. Proper staging is important for selecting patients who may benefit from surgical resection and for defining the treatment modalities of patients who will undergo radiotherapy.\nThe histopathologic evaluation of lymph nodes is considered the gold standard in assessing the presence or absence of metastases in the mediastinum. There are several invasive methods that can be used for this purpose: mediastinoscopy, anterior mediastinotomy, transthoracic needle aspiration, endobronchial or esophageal ultrasound with needle aspiration, and thorachoscopy. 1,2 Mediastinoscopy is the most common invasive test. It has a mean sensitivity of up to 80%, with a range of 44% to 97%. With this method, only high and low paratracheal, pre-tracheal, and subcarinal lymph nodes are accessible; there is also a low but real risk of morbidity and mortality. 1 In an attempt to reduce the frequency of invasive methods or to guide the most appropriate procedures for lymph node biopsies, noninvasive imaging tests are used when applicable. Computed tomography (CT) is the imaging method of choice in the evaluation and staging of primary cancers. The diagnostic CT criteria for the involvement of lymph nodes are based on their sizes, especially when their minor axes are longer than ten millimeters. However, small lymph nodes that are considered normal according to such criteria may contain tumor cells, while inflammatory and infectious diseases may be responsible for enlarged lymph nodes, limiting the overall effectiveness of this diagnostic test. In a meta-analysis by Toloza that evaluated 20 studies, chest CT examinations showed a sensitivity of 57%, specificity of 82%, and positive and negative predictive values of 56% and 83%, respectively. 3 Tomographic imaging in nuclear medicine is based on the metabolic activity of tissues and may be useful for identifying pathological changes before they are detected by radiological examinations such as CTs. PET (positron emission tomography) scans with 18F -FDG ( 18F -fluorodeoxyglucose) have superior sensitivity and specificity compared to chest CTs and are considered the most accurate imaging method for staging patients with lung cancers. [3][4][5] However, there are limitations related to positive predictive value of this method because there may be FDG uptake in inflammatory cells. 6 The sensitivity can also be decreased when lymph node metastasis is microscopic or below the spatial resolution threshold of current, state-of-the-art scanners. 7 In Brazil, the availability of PET is restricted to a few institutions because of equipment costs and availability of comercial doses of FDG regarding the number of cyclotrons installed in Brazil.\nAlternatively, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is widely available, has lower costs than PET, and does not require the presence of a cyclotron adjacent to the hospital. Sestamibi (hexakis-2-methoxyisobutyl-isonitrile) labeled with technetium ( 99m Tc-sestamibi) is a lipophilic cation that is routinely used in myocardial perfusion imaging and has been used as a tumor-seeking agent. 8 Encouraging results have been obtained with SPECT scanning using sestamibi to detect primary lung malignancies [9][10][11] and to perform mediastinal staging with a higher diagnostic accuracy higher than chest CTs. 12,13 Despite the positive results obtained with sestamibi, particularly regarding its specificity, there are difficulties in the analysis of mediastinal images. The main difficulty is related to the limited spatial resolution of SPECT. Furthermore, the vascular structures in the mediastinum and heart, where sestamibi is taken up, interfere with the correct interpretation of the images and could cause false positive results and decrease the diagnostic capability of the method.\nThe association of functional images and anatomical information from CTs may be useful in interpreting SPECT by providing more accurate data regarding the location and extent of tumor lesions. Hybrid devices usually have dual detectors, with scintillation cameras and low-dose CT scanners. Sequentially, data from both CT and SPECT are acquired. The two images are merged, creating SPECT images that are superimposed on corresponding anatomical planes. This image fusion may help to differentiate between tumors and other areas of physiological activity. 14,15 The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of SPECT/CT using the radiotracer 99m Tc-sestamibi in the mediastinal lymph node staging of patients with non-small cell lung cancer and candidates to surgical treatment.\n\nPatients\nA cross-sectional study with prospective data collection was conducted from December 2006 to February 2009 at the Hospital de C\u00e2 ncer de Barretos-SP. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) patients of either sex, 2) patients who were at least 18 years old, 3) patients with histological diagnoses of non-small cell lung cancer (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or large cell carcinoma) or pulmonary lesions that were strongly suspicious for neoplasia, 4) patients with clinical stages I, II, or III, as classified by the sixth edition of TNM 16 with performance status that allowed surgery enrollment (ECOG PS zero or 1), and 5) patients who agreed to participate in the study and signed the informed consent form. Patients were excluded if their diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer was not confirmed after surgical resection. Patients with bulky lymph node metastases that were considered unresectable and pregnant patients were also excluded.\nThe clinical evaluation included: physical examination, hematologic and biochemic screening, cardiologic evaluation, bronchoscopy when the pulmonary lesions were considered accessible for this method, bone scan, chest and upper abdomen CT, brain MRI or CT. Forty one patients were enrolled in the study. All of the patients were submitted to surgical procedures for diagnosis and treatment which were performed within 30 days after chest CT and SPECT/CT. The type of resection performed on each patient was defined by the thoracic surgery team in accordance with the extent of the primary tumor. Mediastinal systematic lymph node dissection was performed for adequate pathological staging according to the tumor location. For tumors of the right lung, a mediastinal dissection included the ipsilateral hilar region as well as the upper and lower paratracheal, subcarinal and paraesophageal lymph nodes. For left lung tumors, the left hilar region, lower paratracheal area, aortopulmonary window, and para-aortic, subcarinal, and paraesophageal lymph nodes were sampled. Lymph nodes were identified according to the Mountain nodal station classification system 16 and were sent for histopathological analysis, which was performed by an experienced pathologist with expertise in lung cancer. The largest diameter of the metastatic foci in the lymph nodes was divided into two groups: those,10 mm and those $10 mm.\n99m Tc-sestamibi SPECT/CT The GE Medical Systems, Millennium VG, Hawkeye hybrid equipment was used. Every patient received an injection of 1,110 MBq (30 mCi) of 99m Tc-sestamibi, which was prepared following the manufacturer's instructions (Bristol-Myers Squibb Medical Imaging, Massachusetts, USA). Images were acquired 10 minutes after the administration of sestamibi with patients placed in supine positions with their arms elevated.\nSPECT: Emission images were acquired using a dual-head, large field-of-view scintillation camera equipped with a lowenergy, high-resolution collimator (VPC-45). The images were acquired every 20 seconds, at a 3\u02daangle, in a circular orbit of 180\u02daper detector array, and using a 1286128 matrix. The equipment was calibrated for a photopeak of 140 keV with a symmetric 20% window.\nCT images were acquired sequentially in a non-dedicated 3rd-generation scanner installed in the SPECT camera gantry, with a 10 mm slice thickness (maximum of 40 slices), a maximum current of 2.5 mA and a 140 kV potential.\nThe raw data from SPECT and CT were transferred from the acquisition equipment to an Entegra workstation (General Electric Healthcare), and the tools provided by the manufacturer were used to process the data.

It\u2019s not particularly good, mind you, but when the alternative is a rubbery slab of sadness bound together by pink slime (sorry: lean finely-textured beef), a freshly-made meatloaf burger is a pretty big win.\nLike almost every other burger joint of a certain age, you order your hamburger and then pick your toppings from behind the glass. I went with pickles, tomato and mayo (which, again, like most older establishments, was actually Miracle Whip or something similar).\nIt wasn\u2019t bad. The burger had a good amount of char from the grill without being burnt (like most places that were open before the fall of the Soviet Union, the burgers are grilled rather than griddled. Yeah, these places all followed the same template back then).\nThe patty had a pretty pronounced meatloafy flavour, I\u2019m assuming from garlic and other spices mixed right in with the beef, but as far as this type of burger goes, I\u2019ve certainly had worse. There was still a vague beefy flavour, even if it was mostly wiped out by the spices.\nThe well done patty was a little bit dry and a little bit tough, but again, I\u2019ve had worse. Like I said: it\u2019s not particularly good, but it\u2019s not bad, either.\nThe toppings were fine, aside from the aforementioned mayo substitute. The bun was slightly too big and too dense; the beef-to-bun ratio was off, but it was otherwise a decent bun.\nAs for the fries, they were a bit undercooked, but aside from that they were pretty good.\nYep \u2014 another old school burger joint serving a grilled, meatloaf burger.\nHey, at least it\u2019s not frozen \u2014 that\u2019s an option, of course (because that\u2019s the rule: every burger place that opened before, say, 1990 needs to have a frozen burger on the menu. Don\u2019t ask me why), but they also serve a burger labeled as homemade.\nI ordered the homemade, because I\u2019m not a crazy person, but if you really like your burgers rubbery with an indiscriminate meat-like flavour, the frozen burger is there.\nThe sky was still blue and up was still up, so I knew that it was going to be a meatloaf burger, and it was. No; pigs have not learned to fly quite yet.\nIt was okay. It was super meatloafy, with the flavour coming predominately from the seasoning, and with a vaguely mushy texture from the sheer volume of non-meat-related gunk they\u2019ve got mixed in.\nIt wasn\u2019t overly dry and it didn\u2019t taste bad, I guess, so it\u2019s got that going for it, but even by the standards of meatloaf burgers it was middling.\nIt was grilled, with a nicely crispy, smoky exterior; this was a highlight. Actually it was the highlight, because there wasn\u2019t much else that stood out here.\nBut again, it wasn\u2019t bad \u2014 people like it (in fact the impetus for this particular visit was a recommendation from a friend on Facebook), and I guess I can kind of see why. I\u2019ve certainly had worse.\nI ordered it as a combo with fries and a drink, and a ten dollar bill netted me some small change, so it\u2019s definitely not overpriced.\nAs for the fries, they were typical frozen fries. Bland, but they get the job done.<|endoftext|>Kodakkodak Guest House - Hostel.

We hope, you enjoy this as much as the video. Of course, this transcript was created with deep learning techniques largely automatically and only minor manual modifications were performed. Try it yourself! Also, if you spot mistakes, please let us know!\nWelcome, everybody! My name is Andreas Maier. I\u2019m a professor of computer science at the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg. I want to talk to you today about research videos and research presentations. I know that many of you are producing videos like the one I\u2019m producing right now in order to highlight their research. So, I thought that it might be interesting for you that you can actually convert these videos into blog posts quite easily, This is why I want to present to you AutoBlog today. So, this is a small set of tools that I created over the last couple of months that can be used to generate blog posts very quickly from research videos. So, let\u2019s see what I have for you.\nHere\u2019s the outline of my talk. Why would you want to do this? Actually, I want to show you how to prepare the talk amd how to record and edit the presentation. Finally, once the presentation is recorded, I want to show you how to use youtube and its automatic speech recognition (ASR) features in order to extract the spoken text. Then, I want to introduce you to the AutoBlog tool chain. I will finish this presentation with some summary and future work.\nSo, why do we actually need anything like this AutoBlog? Well, you see that during the Corona Crisis, we have recorded many of these video presentations. I think many of them are really wonderful. If you look at platforms like YouTube, you can see them and they are really splendid and wonderful presentations. However, videos may be of limited utility. So, you can listen to them and you can either do this at home or if you\u2019re on the road then you probably need headphones. If you now want to make your research presentations more accessible, it would be nice to have a corresponding blog post. Also, if you had the text that you have been speaking in the entire video, then you could also very easily do a full-text search within. This can also be done after you have been using AutoBlog. So, in summary, we can say if you would be able to generate blog posts from video presentations, then you can increase the impact of your research and of course its visibility.\nSo, if you want to use features like this, you have to prepare your slides obviously. You follow the same rules as you typically do when you\u2019re actually doing presentations. So, you keep your slides simple and follow presentation guidelines. You know there are the 5\u00d75 or 7\u00d77 rules that you want to obey such that the slides are not too full. They should look appealing. If you want to use AutoBlog, make sure that you have at most one animation per slide because we want to use the export to pdf feature in order to use it later on for the blog post creation. So, that is one thing that you should keep in mind if you want to use the software that I\u2019m presenting here today.\nWell, what next? You record and edit the presentation video. Most of you have done this already plenty of times. You can use simply screencasts by doing a recording of the screen with your voiceover. There are also advanced strategies like the one I\u2019m using here. I\u2019m using OBS such that I can present the slides and record myself while presenting them.  You can remove all the \u201cum\u2019s\u201d, \u201cahs\u201d, and all the things when you didn\u2019t say exactly what you wanted to say. Finally, you want to export the video to a format such that it can be uploaded to YouTube. I recommend the mp4 format. My favorite tool for video editing right now is iMovie because it came with my mac, but there\u2019s also plenty of other things that you can use in order to create your videos. So, once you did all of that, you can upload your video to YouTube in order to use automatic speech recognition.\nYoutube has a wonderful automatic speech recognition that is used in the automatic"

LTD.\nStarting from March 31st, 2021 - Logiwill Global Supply Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Kawasaki City, Kanagawa Prefecture, President: Seiji Yamaguchi), together with China Post business services, and Taeltech - a Shanghai-based IT venture (CEO: Alex Busarov; URL: https://www.taeltech.com/) will be offering a comprehensive solution \"Express Live Commerce AI\" to enable easy access to the China market for the Japanese manufacturers. The service will encompass market analytics, brand protection, and service for expedited customs clearance.\nThe new service will open up a new performance-based sales channel leveraging China's booming live commerce platforms and \"direct-to-consumer\" shipment model.\nCurrently, the size of the live commerce market in China has exceeded 14 trillion yen and is growing rapidly (source: see note). On the other hand, due to the increasing demand for local influencers (commonly known as \"KOL\") who introduce products, the cost of hiring these KOLs is rising. Moreover, the quality of promotion tends to be very uneven. The new service allows Japanese manufacturers to test their products on China's live commerce platforms before committing to a full-scale entry.\nIn addition to product sales, the manufacturers will gain access to Taeltech\u2019s AI-driven marketing technology. The latter allows for precise measuring of consumer needs, brand preference, and brand positioning within China's ultra-competitive environment. This new generation of marketing technology far exceeds the traditional research and survey methods in speed, price, and precision. Thus the manufacturers, having tested the market, will enjoy comprehensive support for the full-scale market entry.<|endoftext|>Does the surgeon\u2019s experience influence the outcome of laparoscopic treatment of common bile duct stones?\nBackground The aim of this study was to assess laparoscopic treatment of choledocholithiasis with respect to the surgeon\u2019s experience.

Two types of surgeons were defined: junior surgeons with fewer than ten laparoscopic common bile duct...\nBackground The oncologic safety and feasibility of laparoscopic D2 gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer are still uncertain. The aim of this study is to compare our results for laparoscopic D2 gastrectomy with those for open D2 gastrectomy. Methods Between 1998 and 2008, a total of 336 patients with clinical T2, T3, or T4 tumors underwent laparoscopic (n = 186) or open (n = 150) gastrectomy involving...\nBackground The use of lightweight meshes in incisional hernia repair could have beneficial effects on quality of life. This study aimed to compare a new titanium-coated lightweight mesh with a standard composite mesh after laparoscopic incisional hernia repair. Methods A randomized controlled single-center clinical trial was designed using the basic principle of one unit, one surgeon, one technique...\nBackground Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) represents the evolution of surgery towards less invasive procedures. The feasibility of NOTES transrectal approach has increased its clinical applicability. This report describes a first series of minilaparoscopy-assisted transrectal low anterior resection with double purse-string end-to-end circular stapler anastomoses. Methods...\nBackground Fully covered self-expandable metal stents (FCSEMS) have been used as a rescue therapy for several benign biliary tract conditions (BBC).

Gastric decompression and resuscitation are important elements of preoperative management of acutely presenting PEH. The optimal time for surgical repair after decompression is unknown. We hypothesized that in obstructed PEH, early surgery may improve outcomes...\nBackground Although incidental hernias frequently are found and repaired during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), the outcomes of simultaneous LC and laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) have not been scrutinized. In this study we evaluated short-term outcome data comparing simultaneous LC and LVHR against LC alone. Methods The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement...\nBackground Currently, no guidelines exist for the treatment of patients with multiple colorectal adenomas (MCRAs) (>10 but <100 synchronous nondiminutive polyps of the large bowel).

[1] These hernias may be detected incidentally or may present with recurrent chest infections or vague gastrointestinal symptoms. Being rare and presentation with non-specific clinical features, diagnosis is often delayed till adulthood. [2] The basic principle of the surgical repair is to reduce the width of the diaphragmatic defect. Traditionally, this has been done by an open operation. More recently, laparoscopic repair is the preferred method of treatment in adults. [3],[4],[5] We report two infants who underwent successful laparoscopic repair.\nTwo girl infants, aged 5-months and 8-months presented with recurrent chest infections starting from early.\nIn both cases; the chest x-ray showed the stomach lying in the right side of the chest. The CT scan showed a hiatus hernia with herniation of the entire stomach into the right lower thorax [Figure 1]. Anesthetic induction was with sevofluorane, oxygen and air (FiO2-0.4). Endotracheal intubation was achieved with vecuronium. Fentanyl was used for analgesia. Routine monitoring were carried out using pulse oximeter, ECG, precordial stethoscope, automated blood pressure, EtCO2, and temperature along with peak inspiratory pressure (PIP). Carboperitoneum was achieved at 10 mm Hg at a CO2 flow rate of 2.5 L/min. All parameters were recorded prior to insufflation, after carboperitoneum, change of position (reverse Trendelenburg) and after desufflation. Ports were made. Stomach was seen herniating, which was reduced back in to the abdomen. The hernial sac was identified, dissected and excised. The right and left crus of the diaphragm were cleared. Lower oesophagus was mobilized partially. Large hiatal opening was closed around the esophagus with 2-0 silk interrupted sutures. In case 1, the fundus of the stomach was hitched to the left cupola of the diaphragm.\nThe intra-operative period was uneventful. Mean operative time was 140 min (150,130 min). There was significant change in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate, which restored to normal soon after desufflation. These hemodynamic and respiratory alterations at intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) of 10 mm Hg and reverse Trendelenburg were well tolerated in both the patients. No blood transfusion was required. The postoperative recovery was uneventful. The infants were fed within 24 h of surgery and were discharged from the hospital at 48 h. At 3-months follow up, both children were well.\nLaparoscopic repair of PEHH is the preferred surgical technique"

Because the site had been indexed and bookmarked significantly by that point, it was important to make sure that pages with strong positions in search engine results (aka \u201cGoogle juice\u201d) continued to get good exposure and traffic after the new site went live.\nWhere we could, we maintained the same site structure and URLs so some existing pages could just be updated with the new design and content. In other cases, we had to implement redirects to point search engines (and users) to the new, updated pages. The results were good \u2013 the site\u2019s home page appeared first in Google results for \u201c[company] jobs\u201d and \u201c[company] careers,\u201d and an inside content page for \u201cMBA rotational program\u201d \u2013 a key campus recruiting effort for the client \u2013 was also first in Google.\nWhat I learned from that project and another recent redesign of that same site is that it takes real planning to prevent a Web site redesign from turning the site\u2019s search engine positioning and referral traffic upside down.\nUltimately, the client does not expect those things to waver, but the actual effort to protect them is significant. If your career Web site ranks well for key terms, make sure SEO (search engine optimization) is a component of any redesign discussion or project plan.\nYou don\u2019t want to lose what you\u2019ve worked so hard for \u2013 and it will take effort just to keep it the same.\n\"I began my IT career as a Web content developer for Circle 1 Network then as a technology project manager for Versant, a marketing communications firm based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

        "passage": "% of sexually active people are expected to transmit the virus within their lifetime.\nWhile it is common and not something you should be ashamed about, it does have the potential to cause certain types of cancers (cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, throat, and mouth) if undiagnosed and untreated. Out of the 150+ strains of HPV, there are 14 common cancer-causing HPV strains and three of them account for 70% of invasive cervical cancer. Although most infections are transient and clear themselves naturally, there are about 30,000 new cancer cases each year that have been caused by HPV. Preventative measures and early-detection practices are essential to keep the spread and progression of HPV at bay.\nYou\u2019ve probably seen commercials or digital advertisements for Gardasil, a vaccine that \u201chelps protect men and women through age 45 from certain cancers caused by 7 HPV types, to which they have not yet been exposed\u201d, according to their website.\nSince HPV vaccination was first recommended in 2006, infections with HPV types that cause most HPV cancers and genital warts have dropped 88% among teen girls and 81% among young adult women.\nFewer teens and young adults are getting genital warts.\nHPV vaccination has also reduced the number of cases of precancers of the cervix in young women.\nThe protection provided by HPV vaccines lasts a long time. People who received HPV vaccines were followed for at least about 12 years, and their protection against HPV has remained high with no evidence of decreasing over time.\nHow else can you prevent HPV?\nLike any other STI, the only way to truly avoid any potential for transmitting HPV is through abstinence. Sex is a natural part of being human, so helping you feel empowered and informed about safe sex is our ultimate goal here.\nIf you are sexually active, the best way to prevent HPV (on top of receiving the vaccine) is to use condoms and/or dental dams any time you have vaginal, anal, or oral sex. If you are fully vaccinated with Gardasil and choose to forego sex with a barrier, your mind can certainly rest easier knowing you\u2019re immune system was given an extra boost to fight off any human papillomavirus you may come in contact with.\nThe other important part of this equation is early detection. If you are a menstruating person who has female reproductive organs, we truly can\u2019t stress enough how important it is to see a gynecologist or primary care provider regularly. Through regular pap smears, your provider will be able to identify any abnormalities in your cervix, allowing for early detection and treatment of active HPV infection, precancer, or cancer.\nIt is much harder to diagnose HPV in men and trans women, as there is no annual screening test to show abnormal cells like a pap smear. This population really needs to rely on their partners to tell them of an abnormal diagnosis or the presence of genital warts. Although HPV infections are asymptomatic in men and trans women, the virus can develop into genital warts or multiple types of cancer, including penis, anal, throat, and mouth cancer.\nThe HPV vaccine is a reliable way to protect yourself and/or your children from developing many types of cancers and genital warts from the most common cancer-causing strains of HPV. If you have any concerns or questions about getting the vaccine for yourself or your child, please contact your healthcare provider. Some pharmacies, including CVS, Rite Aid, and Walgreens, may offer the vaccine. You can use Gardasil\u2019s pharmacist locator to find the one nearest to you.<|endoftext|>I am here to help you take control of your health and your future.

From January 1993 to October 1994, we performed 86 consecutive planned colectomies including 16 (19%) which had laparoscopic preparation. In 3 of these cases (19%) the procedure was converted to laparotomy due to difficult dissection. The 13 patients with complete laparoscopically prepared colectomy were retained for this study. There were 9 men and 4 women, mean age 54 +/- 14 years (range 34-79). Indications for surgery were benign tumor (n = 4), metastatic cancer (n = 3), diverticulosis (n = 3), volvulus of the pelvic colon (n = 2), and endometriosis involving the sigmoid (n = 1). Operative procedures were: short segmentary colectomy (n = 6), sigmoidectomy (n = 5), right colectomy (n = 2). Surgery duration was 280 +/- 75 minutes (range 150-390). The post-operative period was uneventful in all patients. Bowel activity resumed on the second day after surgery in most patients. Mean hospitalization time was 7.4 +/- 1.4 days (range 5-10 days). Laparoscopically prepared colectomy is a reliable simple method providing good patient comfort post-operatively.

The operative technique consisted of abdominal esophagus mobilization, approximation of the crura, and construction of a 270 degree posterior gastric valve, 5 to 7 cm in height. A clinical examination was performed after two weeks, four months, one year, and two years, and fibroscopy, acid reflux monitoring, and manometry were done at four months.\nOne patient required a conversion to laparotomy. One opening of the gastric valve was repaired laparoscopically. There was no perioperative death. Morbidity was limited to one case of pulmonary aspiration of gastric juice. All patients but one who were operated on laparoscopically have been clinically evaluated between four and six months after surgery. There was no dysphagia, diarrhea, or gas bloating reported after two months. Four patients without clinical symptoms refused to go through postoperative explorations. Among the 45 remaining patients, one had a reflux recurrence and another only an abnormality on acid reflux monitoring. There was no degradation of the clinical result among the 26 and 12 patients seen at one and two years, respectively.\nA 270 degree posterior fundoplasty can be performed laparoscopically without major morbidity. A short follow-up examination confirms the efficacy of the procedure and the absence of specific morbidity. If these results are confirmed, they could be an argument to broaden the indications of the antireflux procedure as compared to prolonged medical treatment.\nCes r\u00e9sultats montrent que perop\u00e9ratoire laparoscopique cholangiographie est facile et pas beaucoup de temps.

Gastric ulcers formed predominantly in the squamous mucosa (LC-S and GC-S) of foals with an immature mucosa before the weaning period, and the peak incidence occurred between 61 and 90 days old. The differences in the ulceration sites were considered to depend on the difference in the development (maturation) stage of the squamous mucosa. The grading score of the gastric ulcer increased with the growth of the affected foals. The gastric ulcer might be enhanced greatly by stress in the weaning period.\nTakuma AOKI, Hiroshi SUNAHARA, Keisuke SUGIMOTO, Tetsuro ITO, Eiichi K...\nCase 1 involved a 4-month-old intact male Somali cat in which peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis (PPS) was recognized after a cardiac murmur remained following patent ductus arteriosus ligation. Case 2, which involved a 1-year-old neutered male Norwegian Forest cat, and Case 3, which involved a 6-month-old intact female American Curl cat, were referred, because of cardiac murmurs. Grades III to IV/VI systolic heart murmurs were auscultated at the left heart base in all 3 cats. All cases showed bilateral pulmonary artery stenosis, although there were no associated clinical signs. In Cases 1 and 2, the pressure gradient through the stenosis decreased after treatment with atenolol.\nA one-year-old, castrated male domestic short hair cat was admitted with a history of anorexia, regurgitation and pyrexia for two days. Fever and leukocytosis were identified. There were a large soft tissue density oval mass in the caudal mediastinum on thoracic radiographs, a fluid-filled oval mass in the caudal mediastinum on ultrasonography, and left-sided and ventrally displaced and compressed esophagus on esophagram. On esophageal endoscopy, there were no esophageal abnormalities. CT findings with a fluid filled mass with rim enhancement indicated a caudal mediastinal paraesophageal abscess. The patient was treated with oral antibiotics, because the owner declined percutaneous drainage and surgery. The patient was admitted on emergency with severe respiratory distress; and ruptured abscess and deteriorated pleuropneumonia were suspected. With intensive hospitalization care and additional antibiotic therapy, the patient had full recovery.\nToyokazu KOBAYASHI, Hiroshi KOIE, Arisa WATANABE, Arisa INO, Kazuya WA...\nWe examined the effects of chicken egg hydrolysate (also known as \u201cbone peptide\u201d or BP) on bone metabolism in 5- to 8-month-old orchidectomized dogs. The bone formation marker serum bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and the bone resorption marker urine deoxypyridinoline (DPD) were used as indicators to measure changes in bone metabolism. The following results were observed that Serum BAP was higher in dogs fed BP-enriched food throughout the clinical investigation. Serum BAP was statistically significantly higher in dogs fed BP-enriched food than in dogs fed non-BP-enriched food at 2 months after orchidectomy. This suggests that BP promoted bone formation immediately after orchidectomy.\nYoshiro ENDO, Seiji HOBO, Kenji KOROSUE, Kenji OOTSUKA, Akira KITAUCHI...\nThe present study evaluated the effects of single-dose filgrastim on hematology in 16 healthy horses after long-distance transportation. Horses were assigned to receive filgrastim (0.23 \u00b5g/kg, SC, once; G-CSF group; n=8) or saline (0.9% NaCl) solution (0.3 ml, SC, once; control group; n=8) \u2264 1 hr before transportation. Horses were transported 2,530 km using commercial vans over the course of approximately 44 hr. Clinical examinations and hematologic analyses were performed on all horses before and after transportation. Because the post-transportation white blood cell counts and bacillary neutrophil to segmented neutrophil ratio were significantly higher in the G-CSF group, filgrastim may have promoted the mobilization of neutrophils from marrow. Filgrastim deserves a further study for efficacy in preventing horse shipping fever.\nTakeshi YUI, Tetsuo OHMACHI, Kazuya MATSUDA, Minoru OKAMOTO, Hiroyuki...\nChordomas of the tip of the tail in 6 ferrets were examined using histopathological, histochemical and immunohistochemical procedures. Histopathologically, round neoplastic cells containing numerous cytoplasmic vacuoles of varying sizes, categorized as \u201cphysaliphorous cells\u201d, were observed in the amorphous eosinophilic or pale basophilic myxoid stroma. Physaliphorous cells were arranged in lobules and in a \u201cchordoid\u201d or \u201ccobblestone\u201d manner. The neoplasms were diagnosed as benign chordoma without local invasion and metastasis. Histochemically, the cytoplasm of small neoplastic cells was positive for periodic acid-Schiff stain and alcian blue (AB) pH 2.5 and pH 1.0 stains, but negative for hyaluronidase digestion-AB pH 2.5 stain. All neoplastic cells were strongly stained with colloidal ion, negative for high iron diamine AB pH 2.5 and toluidine blue pH 2.5 stains, and positive for Mayer\u2019s mucicarmine stain. Immunohistochemistry using antibodies directed against low-molecular-weight cytokeratins (CK18, CK19 and CK20), vimentin and mucin core protein (MUC5AC) revealed that neoplastic cells had both epithelial and mesenchymal elements. The expression of low-molecular-weight cytokeratins suggests that neoplastic cells acquired the properties of glandular epithelial cells and produced epithelial mucus. Furthermore, the expression of cytokeratins, vimentin, S100 protein, brachyury and epithelial membrane antigen indicates that the neoplasms were equivalent to the classic type of human chordoma. Therefore, immunohistochemistry using these antibodies can be useful for the characterization of ferret chordoma.\nAn 11-year-old cat with a 4-month history of lethargy, inappetence, dysphagia, partial mandibular paralysis and weight loss, was euthanized due to the rapid deterioration of his condition. Post-mortem radiographic examination revealed severe bone lysis of the left zygomatic arch, temporal and parietal bones. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed a large isointense mass of the left side of the skull associated with extensive lysis of the parietal and temporal bones and destruction of the adjacent tympanic bulla. Gross and histological examinations revealed a pulmonary adenosquamous carcinoma of the left lung, with metastases to the spleen, liver, mesenteric lymph nodes, mesentery, diaphragm, abdominal aorta, left orbit and calvaria. No limb or digit metastases were detected.\nThe purpose of this study was to quantitatively assess the pupillary light reflex (PLR) in normal and anesthetized dogs using a pupillometer. Eleven dogs (20 eyes) of various breeds were included. PLRs were measured with a handheld pupillometer in dim light before and during anesthesia. Anesthesia was conducted with atropine, xylazine and ketamine. Parameters of pupillometry included neurological pupil index (NPi), pupil size, percent of change (%CH), latency (LAT), constriction velocity (CV), maximum constriction velocity (MCV) and dilation velocity (DV). NPi,%CH, CV and MCV were significantly decreased during anesthesia compared with the pre-anesthesia data. The results suggest that atropine-xylazine-ketamine combination anesthesia depresses the PLR. Additionally, this study demonstrates the feasibility of the use of a pupillometer in dogs.\nThis report described radiographic and CT features of atypical diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis in a 5 year-old, female Shih-tzu showing marked proliferative bone lesions in the appendicular skeleton with minor spinal changes. Continuous or flowing bony bridge formation of vertebrae is used as the gold standard for diagnosing diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. However, this criterion seems not to be suitable for appendicular type diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, as in the present case. Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis is a progressive skeletal disease, and thus, enthesophytosis and the multiple bony proliferations at insertion sites of ligaments and tendons to appendicular bones in a lamellar or trabecular pattern were considered diagnostic features of the appendicular type of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis.\nTicks are known to transmit various pathogens, radically threatening humans and animals. Despite the close contact between ticks and viruses, our understanding on their interaction and biology is still lacking. The aim of this study was to experimentally assess the interaction between canine parvovirus (CPV) and a widely distributed hard tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis, in laboratory condition. After inoculation of CPV into the hemocoel of the ticks, polymerase chain reaction assay revealed that CPV persisted in inoculated unfed adult female ticks for 28 days. Canine parvovirus was recovered from the inoculated ticks using a cell culture, indicating that the virus retained intact in the ticks after inoculation, but significant positive reaction indicating virus infection was not detected in the tick organs by immunofluorescence antibody test using a monoclonal antibody. In the case of ticks inoculated with feline leukemia virus, the virus had shorter persistence in the ticks compared to CPV. These findings provide significant important information on the characteristic interaction of tick with non-tick-borne virus.\nTsuyoshi NIWA, Hiroaki SHIRAFUJI, Kazufumi IKEMIYAGI, Yoshiki NITTA, M...\nIn September 2012, several"

Little Rock was founded as a trading post by a French trader in 1722 and named for the rock formations along the Arkansas River that were used as a landmark by river navigators.\nLittle Rock developed slowly, but industrial growth came to the city in the 1880s as the railroad system in Arkansas expanded. Reconstruction efforts throughout the 20th century brought waves of growth and construction as infrastructure of the city was improved, an industrial district- including Timex and Westinghouse factories - was established, and locks and dams were built on the Arkansas River.\nLittle Rock's history of industry and construction includes many job sites and occupations where asbestos products were commonly used. Many workers may have an increased risk of developing mesothelioma cancer from asbestos exposure on the job.

Cross\u2010sectional imaging can be used to establish an early diagnosis to enable successful management.\n\n\n| INTRODUCTION\nLumbar hernias occur through defects in the lumbar muscles or the posterior fascia, below the 12th rib, accounting for less than 2% of all abdominal hernias. 1 In 1886 and 1870, respectively, Grynfeltt and Lesshaft describe hernias which specifically occur through the superior lumbar triangle known as the Grynfeltt-Lesshaft triangle; a space bounded medially by the quadratus lumborum muscle, superiorly by the twelfth rib, and laterally by the internal oblique muscle. 2, 3 We report a case of a patient who presented with a hernia through the superior lumbar triangle, following laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair four months previously. This case suggests pneumoperitoneum in laparoscopic surgery may be a potential cause of lumbar hernia and identifies important considerations when patients present with lumbar swellings and obstructive symptoms postoperatively.\n\n| CASE HISTORY\nA 66-year-old woman presented to hospital with pain over her right lumbar region associated with nausea, vomiting, and an inability to maintain oral intake. Four months previously, she had undergone laparoscopic repair of a giant hiatal hernia. The hernia sac contained most of the stomach and omentum, consistent with a type III paraesophageal hernia. The patient's previous history also included a hysterectomy, osteoarthritis and a preoperative chest XR showed bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with previous asbestos exposure. There was no past medical history of other respiratory disease or reduced respiratory function. On examination a tender right lumbar swelling approximately 3x5cm was noted. The patient's blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, oxygen saturations on air and respiratory rate were all within normal range. Her CT scans before her hiatal hernia surgery did not show any evidence of a lumbar hernia.\n\n| Investigations\nLaboratory blood tests for full blood count, C-reactive protein, liver, and renal function were within normal limits.\nA computed tomography (CT) scan reported a 38 x 81 millimeter right paralumbar hernia containing fat and part of the ascending colon. The hernia neck measured 26mm. The upstream ascending colon was prominent suggesting a degree of obstruction (Figures 1 and 2).\n\n| Treatment\nThe patient underwent open emergency repair of the hernia using a transverse right lumbar incision. She was found to have a 3 -4cm hernia defect through the superior lumbar triangle (Grynfeltt-Lesshaft triangle) containing a large amount of extraperitoneal fat but no bowel ( Figure 3). The hernia contents were reduced easily and an ULTRAPRO Hernia System\u00ae (Monocryl\u00ae and Prolene\u00ae filament construction mesh) was placed and secured with 2.0 Prolene\u00ae sutures into a sublay position (Figure 4). The patient made a full recovery postoperatively and was discharged the following day.\n\n| Outcome and Follow-up\nThe patient was readmitted day 14 postoperatively with a superficial hematoma requiring bedside drainage. At 6-month follow-up, the patient was well with no further postoperative complications.\n\n| DISCUSSION\nFirst described in 1672, lumbar hernias can be of three described types: superior lumbar hernia, inferior lumbar hernia, and diffuse lumbar hernia. These may herniate through two possible anatomical areas. The lumbar region is bordered superiorly by the 12th rib, inferiorly by the iliac crest, and medially by the erector spinae muscles. This area contains 2 areas of weakness: the inferior lumbar triangle and superior lumbar triangle. The superior lumbar triangle is larger of the two and is the most common location for spontaneous hernias. 4 Described in 1866 by Grynfeltt and later in 1870 by Lesshaft, it is a space which is bounded medially by the quadratus lumborum muscle, superiorly by the twelfth rib, and laterally by the internal oblique muscle. 2,3 F I G U R E 1 Transverse slice of CT abdomen showing ascending colon in hernial sac F I G U R E 2 Coronal slice of CT abdomen showing area of hernia relative to 12th rib and iliac crest 20% of lumbar hernias are congenital, and the remaining 80% are primary (spontaneous) or secondary (acquired). 5 Risk factors include conditions that elevate intra-abdominal pressure as well as aging, muscle atrophy, and extreme loss of fatty tissue. 4 Secondary lumbar hernias can occur due to trauma, infection, or postoperative complications. 4 Lumbar hernias are difficult to diagnose as they often present asymptomatically or with nonspecific symptoms such as back pain. They most commonly present as a posterolateral mass that is usually reducible increasing with a rise in intra-abdominal pressure and reducing when the patient assumes the prone position. 5 Approximately, 9% of patients presenting with lumbar hernia have associated bowel obstruction. 4 Low suspicion can lead to misdiagnosis of other pathologies such as lipomas or retroperitoneal tumors. Therefore, in the presence of suggestive symptoms, lumbar hernias should remain a differential especially if there are risk factors.\nOur patient did not report having any mass or lumps prior to her initial laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair. Symptoms in relation to this hernia were evident several weeks after the initial laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair.\nAlthough lumbar hernias have been reported following open surgery, it has not been reported following laparoscopic surgery. Given the chronology of events in this case, it may be postulated that the raised intra-abdominal pressure of laparoscopic surgery may have exacerbated a small pre-existing asymptomatic lumbar hernia.\nTo our knowledge, there are no reported cases in the literature linking lumbar hernias as a complication of laparoscopic surgery.\n80% of lumbar hernias as primary or secondary, within that approximately 25% of these cases are secondary to trauma or iatrogenic. 6 There have been multiple cases of lumbar hernia occurring after an operation, these include total hip"

I\u2019d love to have such a place nearby in Seoul.\nNext, we continued on to the beach. Obviously, there are many beaches in Jeju but we decided to drive to Hyopjae beach.

Which two characters from any of your stories would you choose to take along for the ride and why?\nAmy: Probably Bracken and Green from The Little Goddess \u2014 they\u2019re both pretty, Bracken is muscle, Green is good at the first aid, they are endlessly entertaining, and they\u2019re both great in bed!\nLynn: Is there any one book out there in the literary world that you wish you could\u2019ve written? Why?\nAmy: Tigana by Guy Gavriel Kay. Complex and haunting. The House on Mango Street by Sandra Cisneros. Simple, poetic, and haunting. Pride and Prejudice. Buckets of awesome.\nLynn: Your new release, The Bells of Times Square, is such a beautiful story. At the end, in the Author Notes, you give the readers a little insight on the inspiration for the story. For those who haven\u2019t read the story yet, can you talk a little bit more about what inspired you to write this particular story?\nAmy: My grandparents on my mother\u2019s side were both spies in WWII. They both worked for the OSS\u2013 in fact, my thing with naming people nicknames comes from them. While everybody was assigned an alternate name, so, for instance, my grandpa Ken was known as Phillip, my grandmother\u2019s name was so unusual, (Olga, which is a Russian name on an Italian woman, because, as she claimed, her parents were both immigrants and thought Olga was an American name) that she got to keep hers. Nobody in her office thought that was really her name. But back to The Bells of Times Square, my grandfather was an aerial photographer in the war. Neither of my grandparents were allowed to talk much about their work when they were alive\u2013 much of it became declassified after my grandfather\u2019s death and months before my grandmother passed away\u2013 so I had to do some research things like what squadron my grandfather might have flown in, what kind of plane he used, and why they would need an actual man with a camera instead of the surveillance equipment developed by the British at such cost. (They had problems with the cooling systems in the Spitfires. Test pilots were freezing to death and falling out of the sky. Grim and terrible, the sacrifices made for the war.) And although neither of my grandparents were Jewish, I paid tribute to them in the origin of the two characters as well. Nate Meyer was from Manhattan\u2013 but my grandmother was raised in Queens. My grandfather was a farmer\u2019s son from Idaho, like Walter. The war was one of those rare instances in which people from all walks of life really did come together, and I wanted to pay tribute to that as well.\nLynn: Lastly, you\u2019ll be in Florida in February for The Coastal Magic Convention. Tell us why this convention keeps you coming back? What are your favorite memories of this particular convention?\nAmy: Well, the people of course.\nSeriously\u2013 You, Jennifer, Doloriane, Amy diMartino\u2013 you were some of my very first fans, back when the Little Goddess series was all I\u2019d written. Having readers with that kind"

Although both teams would have the lead at different points, the largest lead for both was just four points until the closing minutes of overtime. Springbrook was able to keep the game tight due to a few crazy plays that changed the momentum, including a monster dunk by Springbrook forward Cameron Rucker that made it a two point game in the second quarter, and ignited the Springbrook crowd.\nPhoto: Sophomore Ethan Ellis takes a free throw versus Springbrook.\nOther than a few explosive plays, Blair's solid man defense was able to limit the Blue Devil guards and create turnovers. After a few back to back layups by both teams, Blair sophomore Ethan Ellis was able to draw a foul on the last play of the first half. Ellis hit both his free throws to give Blair a 23-19 lead at halftime.\nWhile Blair seemed to have control in the first half, the second half was a back-and-forth nail biter. Just thirty seconds into the half, Springbrook hit a jumper to make it a two point game. Blair point guard Kendall Douglas was able to respond immediately with a strong layup. Springbrook began to wake up again in the third when their point guard hit two three pointers in a row. The Blair crowd was silenced, and Springbrook had the lead 28-26, with less than five minutes to play in the third quarter.\nSpringbrook was playing a two man trap at the half line, trying to limit the ability of Blair guards Douglas and Cooper to make plays. But Blair was able to stay composed, break down the trap and get the lead back. After forcing a turnover to end the third quarter, Blair had regained the lead, 35-32.\nSpringbrook's offense was re-ignited in the 4th, making Blair hard pressed to keep their lead. Blair's home crowd went quiet after Springbrook quickly cut the lead to one point. And right when it looked like Springbrook was going to take the lead, Blair center Julius Cobb, who finished the night with 13 points, lit up the gym with enormous back-to-back blocks. But Springbrook was able to rally again and charge ahead for a 40-39 lead with less than two minutes to play. This would be their last lead of the game.\nAfter another huge block from Cobb, Blair went the length of the floor and Cobb hit a layup and was fouled. He made the and-one to complete the three point play and gave Blair a 42-40 lead with under two minutes to play.\nWithout a shot clock, Blair creatively passed the ball around Springbrook and took precious seconds off the game clock. Springbrook fouled Blair guard Demetri Cooper with 33 seconds to play. Cooper was only able to make one free throw, keeping it a one possession game.\nAfter rushing down the court in a last ditch effort, Springbrook missed the game-tying three with 14 seconds on the clock. The Blair faithful went wild, expecting the game to be over. Springbrook intentionally fouled Douglas with less than 10 seconds on the game clock and Douglas only hit one of two free throws to make it 44-40 Blair.\nIncredibly, Springbrook guard Anares Escobar hit a three with 5.4 seconds left. Cooper was fouled on next play and hit both clutch free throws with 4.2 seconds to play. Blue Devil Matthew Balanc, who scored a game high twenty points, hit his fourth three-pointer of the game from the top of the arc as the game clock expired to send it to overtime. The crowd on both sides of the gym went crazy and Blair faculty had to keep students off the court.\nAll the fans were on their feet for the four minute overtime.

        "passage": " distinguished evangelical scholar, and editor of the Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society. Dr. K\u00f6stenberger and his wife have four children.\nJustin Taylor (PhD candidate, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary) is vice president of book publishing and an associate publisher at Crossway. He has edited and contributed to several books including A God-Entranced Vision of All Things and Reclaiming the Center, and he blogs at Between Two Worlds\u2014hosted by the Gospel Coalition.\nNinety-eight percent of the students entering a particular Christian college last year claimed to be Christians. Yet twenty-five percent did not know that Christianity affirms that Jesus literally rose from the dead! What better way to rediscover this truth than to walk alongside the Savior during his final days and moments? Kstenberger and Taylor guide us on our pilgrimage, and they are outstanding guides. More than anything else, they remind us that Jesus final days are not really the end.\nThe center point of history is the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Thus The Final Days of Jesus is an incredibly important work, for it enables us to see the full impact of the social and religious tension that lay behind Jesuss death as well as the theological implications for us. This book is both well researched and well written and is must-reading for students of the Word and indeed for all who wish to understand more fully the God-led events that resulted in the cross.\nThe Final Days of Jesus helps believers take note of the historical events leading up to Jesuss death on the cross. Readers are challenged to see the provocation that Jesuss message and life represented, leading to his arrest and execution. The book demonstrates that historical facts and Christian worship can and should go hand in hand.\nHoly Week is arguably the most sacred time of year for Christians. Andreas Kstenberger and Justin Taylor provide a simple yet eloquent survey of the final week of Jesuss life.

Understanding those risks can help you determine which insurance coverage options you need for continued success and protection from the unexpected.\nFirst, you\u2019ll need the same basic protections as with standard landlord insurance. These include coverage options such as personal liability and property damage, plus optional extras that are well worth considering, such as insurance against lost rent while a property is being repaired.\nVacant properties need coverage too.\nNext, you\u2019ll need to check how your policy deals with periods when properties are vacant. Some risks are higher during this time, such as those associated with a burst pipe or a fire. If nobody\u2019s living at the property, these disasters might not be discovered until the damage is severe.\nWhat coverage options should real estate investors consider?\nSome additional coverage options that may benefit you include coverage for building codes, vandalism, theft, under construction, as well as commercial property, liability, business income, and workers\u2019 compensation.\nIf you are doing improvement work on a property, such as a renovation or extension, you may need builders risk and installation insurance. This may help cover liability for injuries to construction workers and protect against damage to property, such as vandalism or severe weather while the property is still under construction and more exposed.\nAre you interested in real estate investor insurance?

Breakfast Hola is located next to the popular tourist spot, Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum.\nThere was already a queue lining up when we reached.\nCustomers were seated on the sides of the wall and space was rather limited. Furnishings were simple without too much elaboration on the Taiwanese culture.\nBesides the menu on the table, there is an enlarged version hanging on the wall next to the payment counter.\nWhile their noodles and rice items are only available after 10am, we took the chance to order the Taiwanese Staple Braised Pork Rice. The braised taste was decent with the use of ground pork instead and the fluffy rice coupled with some slices of cucumber. However, while we were expecting the norm with braised egg served, we were given a fried egg instead.\nGoing into our 2nd dish, the noodles come with a choice of Black Pepper or Mushroom sauce and we had added grill pork for another $2. The noodle was a disappointment to us and tasted like overcooked spaghetti tossed with some light button mushroom sauce and topped a with fried egg.\nWhile we were thinking along the line of some Teppanyaki meat, we were wrong. The grilled pork was charred, tender and decent.\nComparing Good Morning Milk Tea and Black Tea Milk, the former has a stronger tea taste and is also my preferred choice.\nThe Taiwanese handmade egg crepe roll is perhaps one of the popular orders in Breakfast Hola. The Pork Floss Crepe Roll is listed as a recommended item on their menu. One can opt for whole wheat crepe for an additional dollar. The crepe was soft and chewy encased with pork floss but I still feel that it will be better if there is a more eggy flavour.\nWe ordered their ham version too. The soft and chewy crepe texture was similar.\nOverall, I find that their Crepe was decent only.\nWhile browsing through the recommended Toast section, we took the first option on the list. I was pretty disappointed as I thought my toast would have real strawberries.\nThe toast was the simplest version of all, 2 thick slices of toast with sweet strawberry jam spread coupled with some fried egg and lettuce. Perhaps it was me that had expected too much.\nTheir toast was simple preparation and it will be better if they can be cut into halves for sharing.\nIngredients include the spread of peanut butter, bacon, egg, cucumber slices and lettuce.\nThe last dish of the breakfast serving was the most presentable and delicious toast we had. It was served in triangular stacks with lettuce, egg, ham, tomato, peanut button spread and bacon.\nCompared to the last Taiwanese breakfast we had in Cuppage, I will give my vote to that. Though the service is friendly, it's sad to say that the food here does not remind me of breakfast in Taiwan.<|endoftext|>&gt; do we just let all the cows loose to destroy the local ecosystem or do we slaughter them all?

Now it is Kashmir\u2019s premier resort, cool even during the height of summer when the maximum temperature does not exceed 25 degrees. A number of hotels and lodges cater to all preferences and budgets, from luxurious hotels to unpretentious trekkers\u2019 lodges and huts.\nAround Pahalgam are many places of interest, and because the resort is set between fairly steep hills, it is worth hiring a pony rather than walking. Pony fares are posted at prominent locations. The most beautiful of these is the huge, undulating meadow of Baisaran, surrounded by thickly wooded forests of pine. Hajan, on the way to Chandanwari, is an idyllic spot for a picnic. Filmgoers will recognize it instantly as it has been the location of several movie scenes.\nPahalgam has within it no fewer than eight tiny villages, one of which is Mamal. There is a Shiva temple here, generally considered to be Kashmir\u2019s oldest existing temple, dating to the 5th century.\nPahalgam is also associated with the annual Amarnath Yatra. Chandanwari (2,895 m), 16 kms from Pahalgam, is the starting point of the yatra that takes place every year in the month of Sawan (July to August). The road from Pahalgam to Chandanwari is on fairly flat terrain and can be undertaken by car. From Chandanwari onwards the track becomes much steeper, and is accessible on foot or by pony. About 11 kms from Chandanwari is the mountain lake of Sheshnag (3,574 m), after which, 13 kms away is the last stop, Panchtarni. The Amarnath cave is 6 kms away from there. During the month of Sawan, an ice stalagmite forms a natural shivling in the Amarnath cave, which waxes and wanes with the moon.<|endoftext|>For Healthcare ProfessionalsMedical EducationMonmouth Medical CenterDepartment of SurgeryHouse Staff Research Paper Competit...\nKolarsick P, Boyan W, Dinallo A, James A, Newman J, Yalamanchili P, Dressnes R, Arvanitis M: \"Gastrointestinal Bleeding Following Colorectal Surgery with Stapled Anastomosis\"\nShea B, Boyan WP, Kamrani K, Lepis G, Dupree D, Chang S, Goldfarb M, Kohli M: \"Let's Cut to the Core; Is Core Biopsy Enough for Sub Centimeter Breast Cancer?\"\nKorderas K, Kopelan A: \"Who Should Manage Surgical Patients in the ICU?\"\nBoyan W, Jaronczyk M, Goldfarb M: \"Postoperative Ultrasound Evaluation of Gastric Distension; A Pilot Study\"\nDinallo A, Kolarsick P, Boyan W, Protyniak B, James A, Yalamanchili P, Dressner R, Arvanitis M: \"Does Routine Use of Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Angiography Prevent Anastomotic Leaks?

The priests and priestesses of the Hellenic Religion were persecuted and Hellenic theology textbooks either disappeared or were destroyed in their entirety. The same happened with the works of the Greek philosophers, as very few have survived and these not fully. The word \u201cGreek\u201d (H\u00e9ll\u0113n) was a curse and was punished by death. After the revolution of 1821 and the liberation of Greece, the continued oppression persists even after the restoration of democracy.\nDuring the recent years there have been several efforts to promote and recognize the Hellenic Religion. But these efforts are not derived through a collective action of a mass movement, which would have to assert the obvious in a dynamic way: our rights as indigenous Greeks should be defined not only by the UN Declaration but also by the unwritten and inviolable laws of our ancestors.\nWith the advent of the Vernal Equinox a cycle of contacts is completed in which many of us shared thoughts, concerns and opinions to fulfill a common dream: the recognition and promotion of Hellenic Religion and Classical Hellenic Ideas, Virtues and Values in order to maintain the ancestral Flame immortal.\nOur action begins with the Vernal Equinox to declare exactly what it symbolizes; the beginning of a new season, and the dominance of light. Through this ambitious view we hope to project the everlasting of Hellenic Religion and contribute to its uninterrupted path connecting it with the data of modern times.

These features have potential to be meaningfully organized, relate to specific BPD presentation, and have implications for treatment process and outcome. The present study explored patterns of Axis II comorbidity in order to identify subtypes of BPD.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA well-defined sample of 90 patients diagnosed with BPD was recruited as part of an RCT study. Participants were administered the International Personality Disorder Examination (Loranger, 1999) to diagnose BPD and assess comorbid Axis II features. Other measures were also administered to assess aspects of current work and relationship functioning, symptomatology, and self-concept.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nQ-factoring was used to develop subtypes based on commonly occurring Axis II profiles, identifying three: Cluster A (elevated paranoid and schizotypal features), Cluster B (elevated narcissistic and histrionic features), and Cluster C (elevated avoidant and obsessive-compulsive features). An additional factor analysis revealed two dimensions underlying the comorbid features identifiable as: extraversion versus introversion and antagonism versus constraint. Validity of these two maps of comorbidity was explored in terms of the BPD criteria themselves, as well as on work and relationship functioning, identity diffusion, views of self and others, positive and negative affect, behavioural dyscontrol, and symptomatic distress.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nClinically meaningful subtypes can be identified for BPD based on co-occurring Axis II features. Further research is needed to replicate and further establish base-rates of these subtypes as well as their differential implications for treatment.<|endoftext|>In Dollars and Uncommon Sense, Army veteran and Certified Financial Planner Steve Repak shows you why, and how, to use uncommon sense to get back on track.

Financial stability means having the ability to meet basic needs at a minimum cost and having the ability to pay your debts in full each month. Financial security comes with planning for future success and having the ability to set aside money for your retirement years.\nPlanning For Success Financial stability includes knowing exactly what your finances are, both on a monthly basis and in terms of your assets. Planning for financial security also involves setting aside money for retirement and for any debt that may arise.\nTo be able to plan for financial security, you should have at least three months\u2019 worth of monthly expenses, including all your bills, car payments, student loans, medical bills, groceries, etc. In addition to your daily expenses, you should include any investments such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or other investments.\nAssets are all of your tangible assets like jewelry, furniture, vehicles, etc. Financial security can be increased by increasing your savings to several times your current level of income and liquidating some of your assets. This will increase your financial security to the point where you won\u2019t need to rely on your employer or banks for money when things get tough.\nAnother way to increase your financial security is by investing in your future. There are several investment avenues available today, but there are a few major ones that are most commonly used today. One such avenue is stock investing; another is in real estate; another is in mutual funds and other investments that will allow you to build up your nest egg over time.\nRetirement planning is important because it will allow you to build your nest egg while building on your retirement and long term financial stability. You will also be able to save for your children\u2019s college education, your own children\u2019s education, and other family members in your life that you will depend on in the future.\nFinancial stability will also allow you to have peace of mind. If you have a stable financial future, you will not worry about whether you can make the minimum monthly payments on your debt or the interest on it. Your credit score will be much higher, and this will help you secure loans in the future. Also, if you are financially responsible you will see a positive affect on your financial situation, which will improve your credit rating and eventually help you obtain credit card, home equity loans, auto loan, and more.\nFinancial security is necessary for many people, especially in today\u2019s economic climate. People do not have the time or money to take their finances into account when building their retirement plans. Many have to work several jobs to earn a decent salary and pay for a mortgage. In order to avoid the \u201cblack hole\u201d or the bottom of the barrel, it is crucial that you plan ahead and prepare financially.\nFinancial security can be built up by investing your money in a 401k or other defined benefit retirement plan that you can access throughout your working life. A Roth IRA will allow you to accumulate money tax-deferred, which means that you will still be able to enjoy the same standard of living when you retire. The money you contribute will grow as you earn it; however, there will be additional tax deferred charges that you will have to pay if you wish to invest the money in the stock market or any other retirement funds that you may desire.\nSome investments that you should consider investing in include gold, real estate, bonds, mutual funds, and any other investments that will give you an income to build on after you retire. The key thing you need to know is that not all investments are created equal and not all investments will bring you the same amount of financial security. Your investments will depend greatly on your individual goals and objectives.\nThere are different levels of financial security; some are more secure than others. For example, a Roth IRA is a great way to have a retirement plan while still being able to take care of expenses that you may have to during your working years. A defined benefit retirement plan allows you to take care of your medical expenses, but you can\u2019t sell your home until you are at least 62 years old.\nRetirement planning is very important and it is possible to achieve both with one little investment.

        "passage": " minimally invasive techniques in comparison with traditional (transsternal) surgery increasingly demonstrate that the long-term complete remission rate for myasthenia gravis is similar.\nHowever, where a myasthenia gravis condition is complicated by an early stage thymoma (cancer of the thymus), the basic operation to remove the thymus becomes a radical (extended) thymectomy, where it is essential that thymic tissue is completely removed to prevent the recurrence of cancer. This is a case where some surgeons find the robotic thymectomy controversial. It is suggested that without using the maximally invasive \u2013 and visually open \u2013 transsternal incision some thymic tissue might be left behind.\nThis was a criticism most often heard when we introduced the robotic technique ten years ago. Since then the robotic equipment has undergone years of further development and improvement. Surgeons performing the robotic surgery have developed more refined procedures and overall the training and experience level of surgeons skilled in robotic technique has increased. The result is that multiple studies throughout the world now suggest the robotic technique has similar effectiveness and remission rates as the transsternal approach. Even with a small sample and short follow-up, robotic extended thymectomy appears to be an effective treatment for early-stage thymomas.\nFor the patient undergoing a robotic assisted thymectomy, the biggest advantages accrue from the minimally invasive approach and the precision of the internal surgical work. The difference in recovery between an operation that requires four or five small incisions on the side of the chest versus an operation that requires cutting through the sternal bone is enormous. The result is that multiple studies throughout the world now suggest the robotic technique has similar effectiveness and remission rates as the transsternal approach. Even with a small sample and short follow-up, robotic extended thymectomy appears to be an effective treatment for early-stage thymomas.\nAchalasia is a problem with the nerve cells that transmit messages to the esophageal musculature characterized by increased lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure, diminished or absent peristalsis in the distal portion of the esophagus composed of smooth muscle, and lack of a coordinated LES relaxation in response to swallowing. The ultimate cause of this degeneration is unknown. Autoimmune disease or hidden infection is suspected. A Laparoscopic or Robotic modified Heller myotomy is considered the standard of care for palliation of this incurable but benign disease.\nSublobar lung resection and brachytherapy seed placement is gaining acceptance for T1 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in select patients with comorbidities precluding lobectomy. Our institution first reported utilization of the da Vinci system for robotic brachytherapy developed experimentally and later applied to high-risk patients. Robotic brachytherapy seed placement is a feasible adjuvant procedure to reduce the incidence of recurrence after sublobar resection in medically compromised patients. Tailored robotic seed placement delivers an exact dosing regimen in a minimally invasive fashion with equivalent precision to open surgery.\nHow the lung is accessed matters a great deal. A robotic minimally invasive surgery leaves only tiny incisions, which heal more quickly and with less pain. The fine motor control of the robotic instruments makes it possible to perform certain actions, such as lymph node dissection, one of the typical surgical procedures for the lobectomy, with greater precision and speed than if it were done by hand. The end result is that while a robotic lobectomy usually requires at least as much time as an open procedure, it is generally less traumatic to the patient.\nA paraesophageal hernia is a type of hiatal hernia where the junction of the stomach and the esophagus remains in place, but part of the stomach is squeezed up into the chest beside the esophagus. Surgical repair of paraesophageal hernia is generally recommended for symptomatic patients however the operative strategy remains a matter of debate, and there is not a single technique guaranteeing uniform long term success. Our techinique is a paraesophageal hernia repair with a combination of laparoscopic and robotic technology in order to ensure the best dissection as well as technical fixation of the mesh to the diaphragmatic defect. The antireflux procedure is determined by the intraoperative need to displace the gastroesophageal junction during reduction of the hernia as well as preoperative studies.\nWhen a sympathectomy results in the body starting to sweat copiously at another location, compensatory sweating; the cause of this change isn\u2019t fully understood. Consequently it should not be surprising that the results of a graft to reverse a sympathectomy are not always fully predictable. The procedure is still relatively new and there are questions about the permanency of the graft, the regeneration of appropriate nerve signals, and whether the body will develop other side effects.<|endoftext|>Free download.

But there were, besides Hathor-Sekhmet, other goddesses of beer, like MnqJ whose name could well have been a pun on, or a deification of, the mnqJ f vs where beer was stored, and Tnmy.

Egypt Beer was thus, in Greek opinion, the originator of beer, although the Sumcro- Akkadians, another agricultural people who prepared it since the dawn of history, may share the claim. One may even surmise that its invention came as a result of the accidental discovery in household bakeries of the euphoria experienced after consuming cereals prepared to make gruels or bread, when left to ferment.\nHebrew laham, bread to indicate brewing, and by the constant association of baking and brewing in Egyptian art. The divinities presiding over it were goddesses, and girls and maids arc prominent in the processes of kneading, sieving and actual brewing, as represented in tomb art. Prehistoric jars examined by Petrie, p. Social Standing Beer, however, was the usual drink of commoners, while wane w'as the beverage of the rich. Athenaeus indicated this difference in the tale of Food: B j This distinction may be the reason why, in Egypt, less is known about beer than about wine, since the customs and food habits of the poor were less carefully recorded by the chroniclers than those of the rich.\nThe Greek and Roman traxTllers equated beer with poverty, while they, themselves, understood and appreciated wine. Even Aristotle is credited with a discriminatory comment 'Alen who have been intoxicated with wine fall down face foremost, whereas they who have drunk barley beer lie outstretched on their backs; for wine makes one top-heavy, but beer stupefies.\nBut the extensive lists of oflerings and donations that have survived, do not bear this out.\nLe chamane (French Edition)!\nMind Capture: How You Can Stand Out in the Age of Advertising Deficit Disorder.\nthe Forest Children.\nCom Quem N\u00e3o Casar (Portuguese Edition)!\nIn fact, Diodorus acknowledged the pleasant taste of the drink made from barley that, he said, \"For smell and sweetness is not much inferior to wine.

Approximately 9 months later, he developed dysphagia, and found to have a esophageal SCC in the mid-esophagus with regional lymph node involvement. He underwent chemoradiation treatment with good response and improved symptoms but declined subsequent surgical resection for esophageal cancer. About 1 year after the diagnosis of esophageal cancer, he developed blood streaked bowel movement and severe anemia. Colonoscopy showed a 3-cm mass in the proximal ascending colon; biopsy showed metastatic SCC, consistent with metastasis from esophageal primary. He subsequently received palliative radiation to the ascending colon metastatic tumor with improvement of anemia, and remained transfusion independent for more than 3 months.\nColonic metastasis from esophageal SCC is rare, and associated with poor prognosis. There are no definite features in terms of location, histological differentiation etc. that contribute to colonic metastasis from primary esophageal SCC. The goal of treatment is palliative and data from our and other case reports support the use of chemotherapy and radiation for symptom improvement and disease control.\nEsophageal cancer including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma represents 4% of all cancers in the United States; in 2016, it is estimated approximately 16,000 new cases and more than 15,000 deaths as a result of this aggressive disease [1]. Globally, esophageal cancer affects more than 450,000 peoples, and is the eighth most common cancer [2]. The incidence of esophageal cancer is rising rapidly with adenocarcinoma being more than SCC in the Western world; obesity, gastroesophageal reflux disease and Barrett\u2019s esophagus have shown to increase the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma [3]. Patients with esophageal cancer frequently present with locally advanced disease, and about 40% of patients have evidence of metastatic disease on presentation. Common sites of metastasis include liver, lung and bone [4]. Here, we present a rare case of colonic metastasis from primary esophageal SCC.\nIn July 2009, a 60-year-old Caucasian male with hypertension and dyslipidemia presented with neck stiffness and right neck mass for 3 months. The patient had a 20-pack year history of smoking and moderate alcohol intake. Initial ENT evaluation with direct laryngoscopy showed some fullness in the right base of the tongue without any abnormality at the larynx or pyriform fossa. CT scan of neck demonstrated a 3.8-cm necrotic mass in the right neck. Ultrasound guided biopsy of the right neck mass was consistent with malignant cells favoring poorly differentiated SCC. Patient was referred to our center for further work up. Repeat direct laryngoscopy showed a suspicious lesion at the right aryepiglottic fold. He underwent CT scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis plus PET-CT, which showed a right neck mass (4.2 cm \u00d7 3.5 cm) medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. A diagnosis of metastatic SCC of the right cervical lymph node with likely primary lesion at the base of the tongue or larynx was made.\nPatient underwent right supra-glottis CO2 laser laryngectomy and right modified radical neck dissection in September 2009. Pathology from the right supra-glottis laryngectomy showed 0.6 cm tumor, which was consistent with moderately to poorly differentiated SCC with clear margins. Right neck dissection showed 3 out of 21 lymph nodes positive for metastatic SCC with the largest being 3 cm in greatest dimension. There was an extra-nodal extension of the tumor. The final diagnosis was T1N2bM0 (Stage IVA) right supra-glottis laryngeal SCC. Patient received adjuvant treatment with chemoradiotherapy completed in January 2010. Two months after completion of adjuvant treatment, the fiber-optic laryngoscopy and CT scan of neck showed no evidence of disease.\nIn October 2010, patient developed dysphagia, and examination of esophagogastroduodenoscopy and showed a stricture at 31 cm, a friable mass at 31\u201334 cm, Barrett\u2019s mucosa noted from 34 to 39 cm, and the diaphragm at 39 cm from the incisors, respectively. Endoscopic ultrasound was done but the scope could not be passed through the stricture, but showed a mass at about 24 cm from the incisors in the paraesophageal area just below the aortic arch. Fine needle aspiration biopsy of the esophageal stricture and mediastinal mass showed poorly differentiated SCC, positive for p63 and CK 5/6 by immunohistochemical study. Imaging study with PET-CT and CT scan of neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis confirmed locally advanced esophageal cancer with mediastinal lymph node involvement. He underwent chemoradiotherapy with weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin, completed in February 2011. A follow-up CT scan of chest in June 2011 indicated a good treatment response with tumor shrinkage. He declined surgery after completion of chemoradiotherapy.\nIn November 2011, he developed blood streaked bowel movement and severe anemia with hemoglobin of 5.9 g/dL. He underwent CT scan of abdomen and pelvis and colonoscopy, and was found to have a 3-cm mass in the proximal ascending colon (Fig. 1). The biopsy showed metastatic SCC (Fig. 2). Immunohistochemical study showed the tumor was strongly positive for CK 5/6, with foci of weak staining for p63 and negative staining for CK20 or CDX2, which was most consistent with a metastatic lesion rather than a primary colorectal carcinoma. He subsequently received palliative radiation (3000 cGy) to the ascending colon cancer with improvement of anemia, and remained transfusion independent for more than 3 months. In January 2012, he also received palliative radiation for brain metastasis. He was offered palliative chemotherapy but he refused. He entered hospice in May 2012, and passed away shortly afterwards.\nOur patient initially underwent definitive surgery and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced laryngeal SCC; the follow-up surveillance examination including endoscopic and CT scan examination showed no evidence of disease. However approximately 10 months after adjuvant treatment, he developed a second primary tumor (SPT), esophageal SCC. It has been shown that patients surviving laryngeal cancer treatment have increased risk of SPT, usually in the aerodigestive tract; the cumulative risk of developing a SPT is found to be 26% at 10 years and 47% at 20 years [5]. Field cancerization, also known as condemned mucosal syndrome, has been well characterized in patients with SCC of head and neck (SCCHN) [6, 7]. This concept of field effect in cancer postulates the accumulation of multiple molecular alterations from long-term carcinogen exposure in the upper aerodigestive tract leads to an increased risk of malignant transformation in the whole tissue region. Active tobacco use has been shown to increase the risk of SPT in patients with SCCHN [8]. In a phase III study, chemoprevention with isotretinoin reduced the incidence of SPT in patients with SCCHN, but the decrease in SPT did not lead to an increase in overall survival [9, 10]. Therefore, life style modification including smoking cessation, close surveillance and imaging study based on symptoms and clinical examination but not chemoprevention are recommended in SCCHN patients with increased risk of SPT [11].\nEsophageal cancer is among the top 10 leading cause of cancer-related mortality and common cancer worldwide. There is a decreasing incidence of esophageal SCC but increasing incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma in the Western world. Most patients present with locally advanced disease which requires combined-modality treatment including chemoradiotherapy with or without surgery. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery has been shown to improve local control, disease-free survival and overall survival compared to surgery alone [12]. For patients with locally advanced disease and unfit for surgery, the addition of concurrent chemotherapy to radiotherapy provides a chance of long-term survival [13]. The liver, lung and the bones are common sites of metastases in esophageal cancer.\nOur patient declined surgery after chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced esophageal SCC, and developed metastatic disease to ascending colon with severe hematochezia and anemia about 9 months afterwards. His symptoms improved after palliative radiation to colonic metastasis, and remained transfusion independent for more than 3 months. He also developed brain metastasis and received brain radiotherapy before succumbing to esophageal cancer about 6 months after being diagnosed with metastatic disease.\nThe predominant histology type of primary colorectal cancer is adenocarcinoma; less common ones include neuroendocrine tumor, lymphoma, sarcoma and SCC [14]. The incidence of primary colorectal SCC is about 0.4% of colorectal cancers, and more than 90% of cases are at the rectum which may be associated with human papillomavirus infection and shares similar carcinogenesis process as anal canal SCC [15]. Metastatic involvement of the colon is a rare occurrence and is extremely rare from primary extra-abdominal tumors. There are case reports of metastatic colon cancer from primary malignancy such as melanoma, SCC of the lung, gastric adenocarcinoma, and invasive ductal breast carcinoma [16\u201318]. To this date, there are three case reports from Asia published in English literature describing colonic metastasis from primary esophageal SCC [19\u201321]. All reported cases were identified as synchronous metastasis to colon from primary esophageal SCC (Table 1). Our patient is the first case in Western world with metachronous colonic metastasis from primary esophageal SCC. The colonic metastasis was unlikely from laryngeal cancer due to the timing and characteristic of metastasis, but most likely due"

His fan base of almost 6 lakh followers on Facebook is a testament to this. And Tamil Nadu weatherman, as he is fondly known as, ensures that his followers stay informed with the city\u2019s latest weather forecasts, come rain or shine.\nAt present, he is busy giving timely updates on the sweltering Chennai weather that seems to be soaring this summer season!\nLooking for some fun ways to keep your child engaged during this lockdown? Here are some Summer Activities for Kids to help you out!\nPradeep\u2019s tryst with nature, began in 1994, when he was studying in class VII. During that year, a sudden and fiery cyclone struck the city of Chennai causing enormous havoc and significant damage. The catastrophic event involved gusty winds blowing at terrifying speeds and trees being uprooted like nobody\u2019s business. What could have horrified any 12-year-old boy, instead, thrilled Pradeep John! The cyclone left a deep impression on the mind of this young boy and since then his love for rains and storms never waned, but only grew stronger.\nThus, began his inspiring journey. And his passion for weather steadily grew, as he monitored and recorded rainfall patterns in different regions and even started a blog to collate his findings. With time he realised that \u2018weather\u2019 was his true calling.\nPradeep John firmly believes that \u2018work and passion can coexist\u2019. And he stands as the perfect example of this mantra. Besides managing a full-time job, he finds the time to follow his heart and storms.\nAlso, in terms of weather as a career, he makes it very clear that in India, the scope for pursuing a career in weather is quite limited, with only a handful of government agencies offering relevant courses. But according to him, if one is truly passionate about pursuing it, put in the right effort"

Since the island\u2019s opening in 2010, hundreds of thousands of Chinese tourists have come to the island with their growing numbers. In 2006, gross domestic product was allocated about 8.5 trillion won (about 8.5 billion US dollars), or about 15 million won per person. The provincial government budget for 2006 set aside 1.1 trillion won, an increase of 10% over 2005.\nJeju occupies a major source of communication, as it includes the leading company for the Korean Internet, (the sole owner of the company Lycos until August 2010). Jeju is also famous for hosting many international conferences and meetings, including the World Scout Conference in July 2008. Jeju has a special international convention center, as the 2009 ASEAN-Korea Commemorative Summit was held at the International Criminal Court Jeju.\nIn 2010, the South Korean central government commissioned Jeju Island to develop itself as international meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibition destination, and since then, the island has hosted a number of high-profile events such as the 10000-PAX China Motivation Group Bao Chen and 8000-PAX Incentives Amway Korea ( Southern). In 2010, the island welcomed the events of Destination 67, which enabled it to reach the 27th globally and seventh in Asia in the United Iraqi Alliance ranking of global meeting destinations.\nBecause of the island\u2019s relative isolation, Jeju\u2019s culture and language differed from that of the mainland of Korea. Jeju is home to thousands of local legends. Perhaps the cultural artifacts are the most distinctive of the island, and are found everywhere in the mass of carved basalt.\nAccording to the 2005 census, the people of Jeju follow Buddhism with 32.7% and 17.5% who follow Christianity (10.3% Protestant and Catholic 7.2%). 49.8% of them are Muslims or do not follow any other indigenous religions.\nJeju Island, also known as \u201cGods Island,\u201d is a great place to spend a popular holiday for Koreans, many Japanese and all tourists. Still one of honeymoon destination destinations for new grooms. The island has a mixture of volcanic rocks, frequent rain, and a mild climate, which makes it very similar to the Hawaiian Islands in the United States. The island offers visitors a wide range of activities: hiking on Halla-san (South Korea\u2019s highest peak), enjoying sunrise and sunset over the ocean, viewing majestic waterfalls, horse riding, or just strolling on sandy beaches.\nAlthough tourism is one of the main industries on the island, the operation of many hotels and other tourist areas is due to the mainland companies, the income does not return to the local economy. Also, you will find that many entry fees for tourist attractions can be huge (although those locally owned areas tend to be cheaper). Like Jeonju and some other areas, locals can enter most places for free or at a sharply reduced price.\nJeju tourists enjoy: its mild climate, landscapes, and beaches with a popular destination for South Koreans as well as visitors from East Asia and other parts. The most popular tourist spots on the island are Cheonjeyeon, Cheonjiyeon Falls, Mount Halla, Hyeobje Cave, and Hyeongje Island. There are a variety of recreational sports that tourists can participate in Jeju including golf, horse riding, hunting, fishing, climbing, etc. Depending on the season, Jeju hosts many tourist festivals including a penguin swimming competition in a season Winter cherry blossom. Festival in spring, mid-summer festival, horse festival in autumn, and others.\nMost visitors to the island are accepted by taking traffic to and from the island through Jeju International Airport as well as traveling within the island by renting cars. Some local products are popular with tourists, including tile, orange and mandarin fish, as well as souvenirs and duty-free shopping.<|endoftext|>Discover why Stream Monkey recommends Pearl-2 to their customers as the preferred hardware encoder for their video streaming solutions.\nLearn how to live stream using Sunday Streams and Epiphan\u2019s encoder systems to broadcast your worship services online.<|endoftext|>My research focuses on one of the hallmark examples of multi-scale astrophysics: star formation in molecular clouds and feedback from massive stars during galaxy formation. It is widely accepted that the unknown physics of star formation and feedback represent the main uncertainties in our understanding of how galaxies form. My group combines major observational surveys of gas and young stars in galaxies across cosmic time with state-of-the-art numerical simulations of star and galaxy formation. That way, we attempt to answer fundamental open questions, such as how most stars in the Universe formed, where the ancient globular clusters came from, and how we can bridge the gap between cold dark matter cosmology and the observable galaxy population. Among others, our research interests cover: the interstellar medium and molecular cloud evolution star formation and feedback (globular) cluster formation, evolution, and dynamics galaxy formation and evolution assembly history of the Milky Way observational surveys (e.g. with ALMA and MUSE) numerical simulations.

What should I keep and throw away?\" - that happens after the fact, during periods of quiet wakeful introspection.\nToday, several guests - Jenny Edwards, Jennifer Fletcher, Mary Tedrow, Barry Saide, William Himmele and P\u00e9rsida Himmele - contribute their ideas on how to practically implement reflection in the classroom.

When the abdominal mass was removed at 10:40, the patient's BP was 95/27 mmHg, HR was 77 beats/ min, CO was 2.51 L/min, SVR was 2,222 BSA, SV was 33 ml, and SVV was 15.5%. Considering the patient's lack of volume due to SVV over 13%, fluid infusion of 500 ml was accelerated. Subsequently, the patient's hemodynamics stabilized, and SVV decreased to 7%. At 11:00, frequent premature ventricular followed by ventricular tachycardia were observed during hiatal hernia repair by general surgeons. We immediately ordered the surgeon to suspend the procedure, and the patient's heart rhythm returned to normal.\nAfter surgery, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) with ventilation at 12:30, and her SpO2 was 100%, ETCO2 was 29 mmHg, BP was 101/30 mmHg, HR was 64 beats/min, CO was 2.90 L/min, SVR was 1,915 BSA, SV was 46 ml, and SVV was 6.59%. The endotracheal tube was removed in the ICU on the second day after surgery, and the patient was transferred back to the general ward. The patient fully recovered and was discharged home on the tenth day after surgery.\n\nFollow-up\nAfter being followed up for 3 months, the patient was free of abdominal discomfort, sweating, acid reflux, neurological complications or symptoms of heart failure. Meanwhile, there were no signs of recurrence through CT evaluation.\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\nThe patient was diagnosed with a giant abdominal tumor with large hiatal hernia and suffered from hypertension and valvular heart disease. In addition, postoperative histopathology of the tumor revealed a spindle cell tumor, CECT of the chest revealed a large hiatal hernia within the intrathoracic stomach located just behind the heart, and part of the ascites herniated into the thoracic cavity.\nXiang et al. 10.3389/fsurg.2022.921887 Frontiers in Surgery and the patient was eventually diagnosed with aggressive fibromatosis (Figure 4). Aggressive fibromatosis, also known as desmoid tumor or desmoid type fibromatosis, was first described by MacFarlane in 1,832 (6). It is a rare tumor of fibroblast origin; the tumor is benign pathologically, with no distant metastasis but local invasive growth (7,8). The clinical symptoms of patients are usually characterized by hard and fixed masses with a long history, and some are accompanied by pain (9). The tumor can occur anywhere in the body, and the most common sites are the proximal extremities and abdomen (8,9). The patient developed a large hiatal hernia due to the abdominal mass that increased intra-abdominal pressure. CECT of the chest demonstrated that the stomach and part of the ascites had herniated into the thoracic cavity from the esophageal hiatus. It has been widely reported that gastrothorax can increase intrathoracic pressure and compress the heart and can even cause cardiac arrest (2, 3, 5, 10). The increased BNP level on admission in this case might indicate diastolic dysfunction due to cardiac compression (11). Once positive pressure mechanical ventilation is applied to the patient, the dramatically boosted intrathoracic pressure will crush the heart violently and cause a sharp drop in blood pressure. Therefore, auxiliary ventilation preserving the patient's spontaneous breathing was performed during the induction of anesthesia. When the patient is awake and breathing spontaneously, the diaphragm has a strong contractile force, which can prevent further tissue herniation and excessive pressure in the chest cavity (12,13). Therefore, we adopted the awake endotracheal intubation technique and avoided the use of muscle relaxants. However, due to prolonged sedation and anesthesia, the patient's breathing rate became progressively slower, which was something we did not foresee. After 50 min, positive pressure mechanical ventilation was eventually needed, and the muscle relaxant was administered intravenously. At this point, the patient's hemodynamics deteriorated suddenly and then were rapidly resuscitated, followed by laparotomy and decompression by the general surgeons.\nA multidisciplinary team is very important for assessing perioperative risks and conducting individualized treatment protocols. The large mass compressed the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in delayed gastric emptying. Therefore, the patient was treated as having a full stomach to prevent aspiration of gastric contents during anesthesia induction. Awake endotracheal intubation can effectively avoid this situation. For severe valvular heart disease and hypertensive heart disease, the total volume and speed of fluid should be controlled during the perioperative period to avoid heart failure. Therefore, invasive arterial blood pressure and cardiac output were monitored dynamically during surgery. Based on continuous monitoring of CO and SVV, target-directed fluid therapy was adopted to maintain fluid balance and reduce cardiac volume load. Furthermore, the circulation and blood pressure plummeted rapidly when the tumor was removed due to a sharp decrease in the compression of the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava. The patient was closely monitored at this time, and over time, fluids were replenished. Although rarely reported, patients with paraesophageal hernia may experience arrhythmia, including sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular extrasystole and ventricular tachycardia (2,4,(14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20)(21). In this case, frequent premature ventricular followed by ventricular tachycardia were observed during the operation, which were closely monitored. Gnanenthiran et al (14). also reported a novel case of ventricular tachycardia caused by posterior cardiac compression from a large hiatal hernia. The literature written in English published from 1989 to 2022 was reviewed, and approximately 10 cases of arrhythmias caused by hiatal hernia have been reported (Table 1) (2, 4, 14-21).\nIn summary, giant abdominal desmoid tumors with large hiatal hernias remain a rare disease with few studies in the literature regarding its implications in anesthesia. Early resection of desmoid tumors and repair of hiatal hernias is an optimal treatment. It is a great challenge to anesthesiologists to manage the patient's respiratory system and circulation. Careful perioperative management and optimized multidisciplinary teams are the key factors in the successful management of this rare condition. In addition, sufficient preparation, rigorous monitoring, awake endotracheal intubation, ventilation preserving spontaneous breathing and target-directed fluid therapy play an essential role in anesthesia management. A single, giant tumor with smooth surface was observed after laparotomy, which eventually diagnosed as aggressive fibromatosis, characterized by hard and fixed masses with a long history.\n\nData availability statement\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.\n\nEthics statement\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the individual(s) for the publication of any potentially identifiable images or data included in this article.\n\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\nPublisher's note\nAll claims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated organizations, or those of the publisher, the editors and the reviewers.

        "passage": " calcium. Mutations in both claudin sixteen or claudin 19 stop the passive absorption of calcium and magnesium throughout the paracellular pathway, leading to an autosomal recessive dysfunction known as familial hypercalciuric hypomagnesemia with nephrocalcinosis. In addition, the composition of the luminal fluid adjustments alongside the proximal tubule. Thus chloride can diffuse down its concentration gradient across the paracellular pathway and be reabsorbed. There are developmental adjustments within the passive permeability properties of the proximal tubule. For a substance to be considered as a developmental inductive substance, it should fulfill four standards: 1. The inducer must increase or lower in concentration in concordance with the developmental change in transporter abundance. Administration of the inducer before the developmental change will end in a untimely change within the transporter abundance. Prevention of the change in focus of the inducer will end in a delay or total prevention of the developmental change in transporter abundance. Developmental adjustments in thyroid hormone and glucocorticoid ranges can have an effect on the maturation of the Na+-H+ exchanger and urinary acidification. The effect of thyroid hormone on maturation of proximal tubule acidification has also been examined. For there to be internet sodium chloride transport, chloride must also be transported throughout the apical membrane or passively diffuse throughout the paracellular pathway. To demonstrate a direct impact of these hormones, proximal tubule cells have been studied in vitro. Sodium transport in the thick ascending limb has been directly examined in vitro and shown to be five-fold decrease in the neonate than within the adult. Direct studies of neonatal and adult thick ascending limbs demonstrate that neonates have a five-fold lower price of sodium transport than adults. Patients with Bartter syndrome have renal salt losing and hypokalemia and usually develop nephrocalcinosis. As noted, the neonate has a blunted capability to excrete a sodium load with volume growth. With quantity growth the fraction of sodium delivered to the late distal tubule was decrease in young rats than in older rats. Gitelman syndrome is a salt-wasting disorder with characteristics similar to those ensuing from long-term administration of a thiazide diuretic, including hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and hypocalciuria.\nBronchogenic cysts are commonly discovered in the mediastinum, close to the trachea or primary stem bronchi, and barely communicate with the tracheobronchial tree. Bronchogenic cysts may be found in the peripheral lung, most commonly in the lower lobes, and arise from irregular branching of the tracheobronchial tree at a later time. Bronchogenic cysts discovered within the lungs as peripheral cysts (usually within the medial third of the lung) could or might not communicate with the tracheobronchial tree. They are lined with bronchial epithelium composed of pseudostratified, ciliated, columnar or cuboidal, epithelial cells, and their partitions include cartilage, easy muscle, and mucus glands. Other extrapulmonary sites of sequestration embrace paraesophageal, mediastinal, or paracardiac areas, in addition to within the muscle of the diaphragm or under the diaphragm in the retroperitoneum. The arterial supply is from the belly aorta or certainly one of its branches, whereas the venous drainage is into the azygous system or inferior vena cava, making a left-to-right shunt. Histologically, the lesion could also be composed of regular lung or immature or dysplastic pulmonary parenchyma, with absent or reduced cartilaginous bronchi and an irregular sample of bronchiolar-like buildings resembling congenital pulmonary airway malformations (discussed later). This malformation is regularly associated with different congenital anomalies, especially congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which happens in ~16% of instances. Cardiac abnormalities, foregut duplication cysts, chest wall and vertebral deformities, hindgut duplications, and accent spleen can be seen. In pulmonary aplasia, solely rudimentary bronchi are current, each of which ends in a blind pouch, with no pulmonary vessels or respiratory parenchyma. Bronchial hypoplasia with variable reduction in lung tissue (hypoplasia) has also been reported. Bilateral agenesis of the lung may be very uncommon and is brought on by developmental arrest within the outgrowth of the respiratory primordium during the embryonic stage of lung growth. In one other case, the trachea was separated from the esophagus, however ended blindly with only two cartilaginous rings. In several different circumstances, branching morphogenesis was arrested on the bronchial bud stage. Unilateral pulmonary agenesis is more frequent than bilateral pulmonary agenesis and will have an effect on either lung, though the right aspect is extra commonly affected. Bronchopulmonary sequestration is most likely brought on by formation of a supernumerary, or accessory, lung bud ventral to the primitive foregut. The blood supply is derived from either the thoracic or abdominal aorta, whereas the venous drainage is to the pulmonary vein of the affected lobe. The affected tissue is usually cystic, lined with both columnar or cuboidal epithelium, and crammed with mucus. Despite concerns related to diminished lung capacity and susceptibility to recurrent pulmonary infections, isolated unilateral pulmonary agenesis has been identified by the way in adults, offering additional proof that unilateral pulmonary agenesis can be associated with sufficient respiratory function. This is coincident with growth of the first and second pharyngeal aortic arches and outgrowth of the forelimb bud. Each of these tissues is provided by blood move from specific regions of the aortic arch. It has been suggested that anomalous formation of the sixth aortic arch, which supplies the growing lung bud, causes main agenesis of the pulmonary arteries, resulting in pulmonary agenesis. Evidence for the latter interpretation is supported by the technology of Nkx2-1-deficient mice, which exhibit aplastic lungs consisting of bilateral saclike constructions, originating from a brief, frequent, tracheoesophageal tube and lined by primitive epithelial cells. The interstitial areas are expanded and composed of loose, primitive mesenchyme with little collagen. Although the capillary bed is in depth, just a few of the capillaries are located adjoining to the epithelial surface of the distal airspaces. Thus, growth of the alveolar-capillary membrane is impaired and gas change is severely compromised. In general, the capillaries are located in the inside of thickened alveolar septa as an alternative of in close proximity to the alveolar epithelia. These problems symbolize a rare type of diffuse interstitial lung disease characterized by uniform developmental impairment of the distal pulmonary airspaces, or pulmonary acini, resulting in extreme pulmonary hypoplasia. The lung lobules are composed of bronchioles lined by ciliated columnar epithelia surrounded by easy muscle fibers, which terminate directly at the pleura and interlobular septa. It normally happens as a end result of different fetal abnormalities, such as diaphragmatic hernia or renal agenesis, which intrude with regular lung development. It is a common cause of neonatal death150 and is incessantly related to stillbirths. Histologically, the alveoli are small for gestational age, however alveolar and capillary development is regular. It is believed to end result from alterations in transcription issue and/or progress issue signaling. Heterozygous Nkx2-1 loss in mice results in neurologic and thyroid dysfunctions, whereas homozygous deletion results in full absence of the thyroid, in addition to severe brain defects and lung hypoplasia. Many of these abnormalities trigger a reduction within the quantity of the thoracic cavity, which bodily restricts the growth of the peripheral lung. Disturbances within the production of fetal lung fluid, fetal respiration, lack of amniotic fluid (as in extended rupture of membranes), pleural effusion, or external compression of the thoracic cavity can all trigger defects within the growth and/or expansion of the distal respiratory parenchyma, leading to a reduced number of alveoli. In congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which is the most common reason for pulmonary hypoplasia, the pleuroperitoneal cavity fails to close. Usually, the left facet of the diaphragm is involved extra usually than the best, most likely as a end result of the left pericardioperitoneal canal is larger and closes later than the best. The severity of the resulting pulmonary hypoplasia varies relying on the timing of the onset of compression. This is accompanied by a decrease in alveolar number and size, decreased gas-exchange floor space, and a proportional lower in the pulmonary vasculature. Most cases are caused by partial bronchial obstruction due to intrinsic bronchial abnormalities, similar to bronchial atresia, bronchial stenosis, and bronchial cartilaginous dysplasia with absent or incomplete cartilage rings. These abnormal bronchi collapse throughout expiration, resulting in distal air trapping and overinflation of the affected lobe. Extrinsic bronchial obstruction may be attributable to vascular abnormalities such as pulmonary artery sling, anomalous pulmonary venous return, or a left-toright shunt (patent ductus arteriosus) with increased blood move via the pulmonary arteries. Intrinsic bronchial obstruction is most frequently associated to defects within the bronchial cartilage with absent or incomplete rings. Additional causes of intrinsic bronchial obstruction embrace mucus plugs, bronchial mucosal folds, or torsion of the bronchus. Abnormalities in other organ systems are seen ~40% of patients with lobar overinflation, most commonly (70%) within the cardiovascular system. The remaining cases (30%) seem to have a more complex polyalveolar pattern of acinar formation with a larger number of alveoli than could be expected for the age of the child78; the lung is hyperplastic with little overdistension of the alveoli. It has been suggested that this is attributable to complete bronchial obstruction throughout early lung improvement, resulting in accelerated lung progress much like that seen in tracheal atresia or tracheal occlusion. Type 1 lesions are the most typical, accounting for 65% of all instances,seventy eight and are composed of a quantity of massive cysts ranging in"

Since first reported in 1992, laparoscopic adrenalectomy has become the standard of care for most benign and some malignant adrenal masses and its advantages have been well proven in a number of large studies within the last 2 decades. The laparoscopic approach for adrenalectomy has been proven to lower morbidity, shorten length of stay (LOS), and shorten periods of disability for the patient. [2][3][4][5][6][7][8] Discharge from the hospital is usually within 1 day to 2 days after surgery, and full recovery requires 10 days to 14 days. Time to first oral intake and first ambulation are shorter with LA (1 day to 2 days) versus open adrenalectomy. 5,7,8 Over the past several decades, there has been an increase in patients who are obese. Obesity has previously not been shown to increase morbidity or mortality in patients who undergo laparoscopic colorectal surgery, appendectomy, paraesophageal hernia repair (PEHR) and cholecystectomy. 9 -15 However, obesity can lead to higher conversion rates in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery and a trend toward more postoperative complications, without reaching statistical significance. 11 To date, no study has looked at obesity in laparoscopic adrenal surgery and its effect on patient outcomes.\nWe are comparing intra-and postoperative morbidity and mortality in obese and healthy weight patients undergoing laparoscopic adrenalectomy, with the hypothesis that obesity would not increase the complication rate.\n\nMETHODS\nCharts of patients undergoing laparoscopic adrenalectomy between January 2000 and February 2010 were retrospectively reviewed, and intraoperative and postoperative complications in our patient population were compared. Obesity in our patient population was defined as a patient with a body mass index (BMI) \u03fe30kg/m 2. Our primary outcomes were morbidity (intraoperative and postoperative) and mortality.\nCategorical variables were tested using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests, and continuous variables (such as age) were tested using 2-sample t tests or Wilcoxon's rank sum test (if skewed). Logistic regression models were fit predicting complications, with the main predictor being obesity group status. Obesity status was kept in the model regardless of significance. Significant covariates were then adjusted for in the model (to adjust for possible demographic/ clinical differences between the 2 groups). Results are reported in terms of odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Another regression model was fit predicting LOS, where the primary predictor variable was obesity group status; significant covariates were adjusted for in the final model. SAS statistical software was used for all analysis, and P values of \u03fd.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\nRESULTS\nEighty patients (45 women and 35 men) underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy between January 2000 and February 2010. Patients undergoing adrenalectomy as part of a larger operation were excluded. The majority of operations (70, 88%) were performed via a lateral transperitoneal approach, 10 (12%) patients underwent robotic adrenalectomy, and 2 patients had bilateral adrenalectomies performed via a lateral transperitoneal approach. Table 1 summarizes patient demographics. The mean age of the patient population was 52 years old. The mean diameter of adrenal glands resected was 4.5cm, with a higher proportion of masses resected were left sided (46 versus 32 lesions, 57.5% versus 40% with 2 patients having bilateral tumors). The largest percentage of these lesions were adenomas (39 out of 80, 49%), and no adrenocortical cancers were resected laparoscopically. Median operative time for our patient population was 124.5 minutes (range, 76 to 330), while median estimated blood loss (EBL) was 50mL (range, 5 to 1200). The median length of stay (LOS) was 1 day (range 1 to 14).\nForty-nine patients (61%) were obese by study criteria, with the mean BMI for our patients being 33.4kg/m 2. Table 2 compares the 2 cohorts of patients. Patient characteristics for the 2 groups are well matched. There was a trend towards older patients, patients who used tobacco, and patients with cardiac disease in the healthy weight group, but operative time, EBL and LOS did not differ significantly between the 2 cohorts.\nThere was no 30-day mortality in the population. For classification, complications were divided into intraoperative and postoperative. Postoperative complications were further classified as major (pneumonia, deep wound infection, abdominal hematoma or abscess, DVT or PE) and minor (ileus, anemia not requiring blood transfusion, UTI, superficial wound infection)."

Right upper paraesophageal lymph node metastasis has rarely been studied. The aim of this study was to identify the clinicopathological characteristics that may be risk factors for right upper paraesophageal lymph node metastasis in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma. Methods This was a prospective observational study of 243 patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) who underwent total thyroidectomy and comprehensive central lymph node dissection with or without lateral lymph node dissection between April 2008 and January 2010. The clinicopathologic findings from these patients were investigated and the patterns of lymph node metastasis were analyzed in the patients who had right upper paraesophageal lymph node disease. Results Of the 243 patients undergoing lymph node dissection, 14 had right upper paraesophageal lymph node metastases. Two of these patients had right upper paraesophageal lymph node metastasis only, without central compartment metastasis. Univariate analysis of clinicopathologic findings showed that right upper paraesophageal lymph node metastasis had significant association with larger primary tumors, multifocal tumors, extrathyroid extension, and lymphatic invasion ( p < 0.05 for each factor). Conclusions Although there were no independent predictors of right upper paraesophageal lymph node metastasis, it can be the only site of metastasis without other compartmental metastasis. Therefore, during surgery for patients with central or lateral lymph node metastases from PTC, it may be helpful to examine the right upper paraesophageal lymph nodes.\nBackground Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common form of thyroid cancer. It generally has a favorable prog\ue000 nosis. As PTC tends to recur in a predictable locoregio\ue000 nal pattern, appropriate surgical intervention [1] can be expected to increase long\ue000term survival. Cervical lymph node metastases are quite common in PTC and have been found in 20% to 50% of patients.\n\u00a9 2012 Kim and Park; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Yaroslav Forsik, who uploaded it to TikTok, worked as a casting assistant on the film's production team and clarified this in an interview with the Associated Press. Confirming that he shot this footage on set, Forsik stated, \"I posted a video for my audience\u2026 I did not think that there would be a million views and speculation on this topic.\"\nThe team behind Region of Heroes also commented on this footage. Speaking to Spam Chronicles, they stated, \"the video posted on TikTok is an eyewitness video of our shooting of a Ukrainian documentary about residents of the Kyiv region during the Russian occupation, based on real events. We don't shoot fakes about Russia. You can see for yourself when the film hits the cinemas in the fall.\"\nThe video in question does not show an effort to falsify footage of Russian atrocities in Ukraine. Instead, it shows the set of Region of Heroes, an upcoming film. This has been confirmed by the individual who first posted the video on social media, who worked as a casting assistant on the production. This claim has therefore been marked as false.<|endoftext|>Laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair: long-term outcome with the focus on the influence of mesh reinforcement.\n\nBACKGROUND\nThe recurrence rate after laparoscopic repair of hiatal hernias with paraesophageal involvement (LRHP) is reported to be high. Mesh reinforcement has been proposed with the objective of solving this problem. This study aimed to compare the outcome of LRHP before and after the introduction of mesh reinforcement.\n\n\nMETHODS\nBetween 1992 and 2003, 56 consecutive patients received LRHP including posterior crurorrhaphy and additional fundoplication. Of these 56 patients, 17 underwent a mesh-reinforced hiatoplasty. Perioperative outcome was assessed retrospectively, and follow-up assessment was performed according to protocol including a barium contrast swallow.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe follow-up period averaged 52 +/- 31 months (range, 9-117 months). The recurrence rate for hiatal hernia without mesh reinforcement was 19% (7/36). No recurrence (0/16) was observed in patients with mesh reinforcement. The intraoperative complication rate was 9%, and the perioperative morbidity rate was 14%. There were neither mesh-related complications nor operation-related deaths.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough challenging, LRPH is a successful procedure. The high recurrence rate reported in the literature can be reduced by additional mesh reinforcement.<|endoftext|>There's two basic kinds.  One kind goes on one of your string's afterlengths.  The other kind attaches to the top-plate of your cello below the bass-side f-hole.  The on-string kind tends to be cheaper whereas the kind that goes on the body of the instrument tends to be more expensive.  Many people have mild wolfs that they are able to handle with the on-string wolf suppressor.  There, you have to experiment...sometimes the G-string works best, sometimes the C-string and of course the position on the afterlength matters.  Here you are generally just moving the wolf note slightly to try to get it between two notes.  For me, the on-string kind didn't work since my wolf is so bad.  For a long time I had a $80 wolf resonator but wasn't terribly happy with it and now I'm using a Krentz modulator and I'm happy with that.<|endoftext|>Bon Jovi performed the title track from their upcoming album This House Is Not For Sale live on US television.\nThe band played the track on Good Morning America and the video can be viewed below.\nThis House Is Not For Sale, the band\u2019s 13th album, is released on November 4.\nThis week, frontman Jon Bon Jovi said that the only contact he\u2019s had with the band\u2019s former guitarist Richie Sambora in the last three years has been via social media.\nHe said: \u201cEverything was great and we were just coming off a break \u2013 but he never came back to work.

The complexes exhibit square-antiprismatic coordination in solution, as demonstrated by analysis of the Yb3+-induced paramagnetic shifts and the X-ray structure of the [YbL3] complex. Luminescence lifetime measurements and a detailed 1H and 17O relaxometric characterization confirmed the presence of an inner-sphere H2O molecule. The Tm3+ complexes provide chemical-exchange saturation-transfer response upon saturation at the frequency of the amide protons. A 19F relaxation study provided accurate estimates of the Ln\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7F distances that were used to rationalize the efficiency of the complexes as 19F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probes, which was tested in vitro using MRI phantom studies.<|endoftext|>People on reddit (and Europeans) all up in arms about how the worker drones aren\u2019t getting paid enough by our corporate overlords.

Just on a lower scale.<|endoftext|>WASHINGTON - Europe has endured the pain of layoffs, wage cuts and tax increases designed to bring government debt under control. So where's the gain?\nFar from falling, debt burdens are rising fastest in European countries that have enacted the most draconian austerity programs, according to The Associated Press' Global Economy Tracker, which monitors the performance of 30 major economies.\nThe numbers back up what many analysts say: Austerity isn't just painful. It can be counterproductive and even make a country's debt load grow.\nMany fear the cutbacks will cause Europe to sink into a self-defeating spiral: Higher debt leads to harsher austerity, growing social instability and deeper economic problems. Governments could find it even harder to pay their bills.\nThe pain is already intense. Portugal's unemployment rate hit a record 14 percent at the end of last year. Ireland's economy contracted a worse-than-expected 1.9 percent in the July-September quarter of 2011. And Greece reported that its already basket-case economy shrank 7 percent in the October-December quarter of last year.\n\"This isn't a healthy situation,\" says Peter Morici, an economist at the University of Maryland.\nUnder a deal approved Tuesday by the 17 countries that use the euro and the International Monetary Fund, Greece will get a $172 billion bailout in exchange for accepting another dose of austerity that includes laying off 15,000 civil servants and slashing the minimum wage by 22 percent.\nProgress has been made in the bond market, where interest rates on government bonds have declined. That's made it cheaper for some indebted countries to borrow.\nBut the drop in rates might not last. And the lower rates probably have less to do with budget cutting than with what the countries' central banks are doing: They're buying bonds, which pushes down rates, and providing low-cost loans for banks to do the same.\nBorrowing costs haven't eased for every country: Portugal's 2-year government note is yielding a stratospheric 14.3 percent, up from under 5 percent a year ago.\nThe best way to compare debts among countries is to look at government debt as a percentage of gross domestic product. GDP is the broadest measure of economic output, and a percentage over 90 percent is considered bad for an economy's health.\n\u00a6 Portugal cut pensions, reduced public servants' wages and raised taxes starting in 2010. Yet in the third quarter of 2011, government debt equaled 110 percent of GDP. That was up from 91 percent a year earlier.\n\u00a6 In Ireland, middle-class wages have been reduced 15 percent and the sales tax boosted to 23 percent (the highest in the European Union). But its debt amounted to 105 percent of economic output in the third quarter of last year; a year earlier, it was 88 percent.\n\u00a6 In Britain, Prime Minister David Cameron staked his political future on his austerity plan. Government debt ratios, though, reached 80 percent in third-quarter 2011, up from 74 percent a year earlier. And Moody's this month cut its outlook on Britain's prized AAA credit rating from \"stable\" to \""

When I was a kid I used to travel with my family during my school vacation, but after completing my education, I made travelling my hobby and covered 36 countries in a span of 6 years. And I am almost done with all the domestic tourist destinations as well. I can put myself as a moderate traveller. Depending on the scenario I will plan my travel accordingly. I am not a solo friendly traveller but I always love travelling either with my friends or family.\nNow I would like to share my experiences from my recent trip to South Korea. From my college time, I have had a fascination with Kdramas and Kpop. In fact, Kdramas like Legend of the Blue Sea, Boys Over Flowers and Heirs are my all-time favourite ones, which I would definitely recommend everyone to watch it at least once. They all star my favourite actor Lee Min Ho, for whom I went al the way to Madam Tussauds in China, just have a sneak peek at his statue. So my love for Kdrama and Korean stars made me all the more excited to visit South Korea. And I can absolutely say that it is one of the most unique destinations.\nI travelled to South Korea from 1st to 9th November 2019, with 6 of my cousins. Since all of us are girls I can name it as a girl gang trip. I always feel that when a trip is planned on our own it would be more exciting and organized. We went to two places in South Korea, one is Seoul the capital city and the other one is Jeju island which is a place filled with scenic beauty. I booked all my flights through the sky scanner so that I can get the best deal. I used booking.com, Agoda and hotels.com to book my stay. I feel if we do prior planning we can maintain a perfect budget line with all luxuries.\nFirstly, we headed to Seoul Incheon airport from Hyderabad airport in Cathay Pacific airlines where flight ticket cost us \u20b936,000 two way. We made sure all our hotels are in the downtown area with easy access to all shopping and sightseeing places. So here\u2019s my 9 days trip and itinerary of South Korea in \u20b970,000 including flight tickets.\nWe reached South Korea at around 9 pm. We stayed in the Hongdae area which is famous for its nightlife and shopping. After we checked into our hotel, we went off to the Hongdae market to do some midnight shopping. This weekend night market in Hongdae is open till 4 am. The market is bustling with vendors selling clothes, bags, socks, keychains and souvenirs. My girls and I had a blast going on a street shopping spree here on our first day in South Korea. We were so busy shopping that we hardly took a minute off to even click pictures!\nOn our second day, we hired a jumbo taxi for local sightseeing in Seoul which cost us \u20b91100 per person. Taking a taxi is a better option if u are travelling in a group. If u are travelling solo or as a couple, the subway is the best option. As November is famous for fall colours we headed to some beautiful palaces where there are bright fall colours.\nN Seoul Tower is one more place not to be missed, which is located on the Namsan Mountain. The N Seoul Tower is around 236 metres tall and is an observation and communication tower. It\u2019s also the second-highest point in Seoul. The view from the top was just beautiful.\nU can reach this place either by bus or by a cable car. We also visited the Love Locks near the N Seoul Tower. Its a belief that if lovers make a wish and lock their love through love locks near the Namsan Mountain, then their wishes will come true. After this, we proceeded to the Cheonggyecheon stream another attractive place with all cafes and eateries around.\nToday is an exciting day for us as we were travelling to Jeju island. We booked our flight from Gimpo airport. Our flight to Jeju cost us \u20b92600 two way. On our arrival to Jeju, we booked a jumbo taxi and we went towards the south part of the Jeju island. There is another option to reach the hotel which is the airport limousine, which will drop you directly at the hotel. Our stay was in Swegpokal hotel which is a 5-star property. That hotel cost us \u20b92000 per person per night. After our hotel check-in, we started our day with some amazing waterfalls know as Cheonjiyeon falls.\nFrom there we went to a very rare sight which only a few tourists know \u201cpink mushy grass fields\u201d. It was really Insta Worthy and I would definitely recommend this place to everyone visiting South Korea.\nOur day started in a slight disappointment as it was raining heavily. But after an hour, the rains stopped and we continued our sightseeing. On our way, we found many tamarind gardens in every corner of the street which made our day more brighter.\nWe covered the east part of Jeju, where we went sightseeing and visited many beautiful beaches and some stone parks. It was a unique experience.\nSangumburi is one more stunning place with tall mushy brown grass and with a great hilltop view. We had a great time talking and taking a stroll down the long walkway here. It was a tranquil, beautiful atmosphere. We ended our day with a great Korean meal at an eatery located in the downtown south Jeju.\nWe checked out of our hotel and headed towards the west and north part of Jeju island. There we visited Mount Hallasan which is famous for its 9-hour hike. But unfortunately, as the weather was bad we couldn\u2019t do the hike.\nAfter this, we next went to the hanging bridge, which is a place with a view of the sea and a narrow streamlined underneath called a Yongyeon pond. The view from the bridge was stunning and we ended up clicking lots of pictures here.\nNext, we went to the mysterious road and from there we arrived at Jeju city and stayed in a 5-star property know as Jeju Sun Hotel and Casino. That cost us \u20b92100 per person per night. In the evening, we explored some underground markets in Jeju city.\nWith lots and lots of memories and happy moments, we departed from Jeju island to Seoul. As our flight was early in the morning I can say it was a hectic day. On arrival in Seoul, we went to our hotel Marriot in Myeongdong. This hotel cost us \u20b93000 per person per night on triple sharing basis.\nMyeongdong is a shoppers paradise with a great range of shops all around.  After the hotel check-in, we started our day with Hanok village which is immensely famous for its historic architecture.\nHanok Village had a rustic, charming vibe to it. The wooden cottages, minimalistic decor, clean streets were just lovely and the place still maintained its old-world charm.\nHere comes my overwhelming part of the trip \u201cShopping\u201d. From Myeongdong we took a subway to Dongdaemun which is pretty famous for its night shopping and 24 hours opened malls.\nToday was the best day of our whole trip with picture square locations and breath-taking views. We hired a cab to Nami Island and Petite France which cost us \u20b92500 per person. We started early in the morning at 7 am, as it was a 2-hour journey from Seoul city. Both of these places are quite famous in Korean movies and serials. There is an entry ticket to both the places which cost us \u20b91500 per person. We first went to Nami Island. This is a half-moon shaped island situated in the Gangwon Province of South Korea. The best part of this island was its breathtaking beauty.\nThe tall trees, the red, yellow and orange fell leaves made the island look like a colourful painting. My cousins and I got to experience autumn in South Korea. I don\u2019t get to see much of this in India, so it felt more like a scene from the Korean Dramas I watched.\nI couldn\u2019t have enough of the leaves which were painted in a bright orange-red colour and I just had to take a photo of it and preserve it.\nAfter Nami Island, we next headed to Petite France which is a french themed cultural village. It was constructed in 2008. It\u2019s also been a shooting spot for many Korean movies and serials. Popular Korean Dramas like Secret garden and My Love From Another Star were shot here.\nKdrama fanatics! Now you know, why I chose this place as a part of my itinerary. Petite France is your way of experiencing a day in France in South Korea. Insane right? We took a walking tour there and we saw a puppet show which was happening in the outdoor theatre. The French-styled houses and lanes with cute decor was simply charming.\nAnd there was a coffee shop and had a cup of coffee at a temperature of 2 degrees. After a wonderful day, spent at Nami Island and Petite France we headed back to our hotel using the Dongdamun Subway Station.\nI can mention this day as \u201cshop till u drop\u201d. As we all know that South Korea is famous for its skin products, stationery and accessories and there"

HB is composed of neoplastic stromal cells and abundant small vessels. However, the exact origin of stromal cells is controversial. Extraneural HBs have been reported in a small series, and peripheral HBs arising in the adrenal gland are extremely rare. Herein, we report a case of sporadic adrenal HB in a 54-year-old woman. The tumor was a well-circumscribed, yellow mass measuring 4.2 cm in diameter. Histologically, the tumor was composed of small blood vessels and vacuolated stromal cells with clear cytoplasm. On immunohistochemical stain, the stromal cells were positive for S-100 protein, neuron-specific enolase, and synaptophysin. The tumor did not reveal mutation of VHL alleles. We herein present a case of HB of the adrenal gland and review of the literature.\nEun-Joo CHUNG; Hwa-Jin CHO; Dae-Young HUR; Yeong-Seok KIM; Kyung-Hwa LEE; Sang-Jin KIM.\nLewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites (LNs) are pathological hallmarks of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) or dementia with LBs (DLB). Incidental Lewy body disease (iLBD) is defined when LBs and LNs are found in the brain of normal elderly individuals. A 65-year-old man presented with autopsy-proven Lewy body pathology (LBP). He had never complained of cognitive impairments or parkinsonian motor symptoms, and he had always maintained independence in activities of daily living. Hypopigmentations in the locus coeruleus and substantia nigra were discovered during the autopsy. The patient showed severe-to-extremely severe LBs in the neocortex and limbic areas, except in the nucleus basalis of Meynert, amygdala, and brainstem, according to microscopic findings. Hence, using several of the previously known staging systems, it was difficult to classify the patient\u2019s LBP type. Furthermore, these findings were unique because they had never been observed before in iLBD.\nEun-Joo CHUNG; Hwa-Jin CHO; Wooyoung JANG; Dae-Young HUR; Yeong-Seok KIM; Kyung-Hwa LEE; Sang-Jin KIM.\nProgressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) overlap clinically with parkinsonism or extrapyramidal signs and pathologically with tauopathy. Asymmetric parkinsonism and cortical dysfunctions are classical features of CBD. However, symmetric parkinsonism, frequent falls, and supranuclear gaze palsy are key features of PSP. Despite biochemically classified as 4R tauopathies, tufted astrocytes of PSP and astrocytic plaque of CBD show pathologically important differences. Herein, we report a 68-year-old man with pathologically confirmed CBD. He was clinically suspected to have PSP because of progressive gait disturbances, frequent falls, and vertical saccade limitation. Neurological examination performed at age 71 revealed symmetrical bradykinesia, axial rigidity, and postural instability with worsening of early existing symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain taken at age 70 detected midbrain and left frontotemporal atrophy and right middle cerebral artery infarction. Left frontotemporoparietal hypometabolism and asymmetrically decreased fluoro-propyl-carbomethoxy-iodophenyl-tropane uptake in the basal ganglia were observed. The autopsy was performed at the time of his death (at age 72), which revealed severe pallor of the substantia nigra and mildly hypopigmented locus ceruleus.AT8 immunohistochemistry and Gallyas staining revealed tau-positive neuronal and glial inclusions, astrocytic plaques, ballooned neurons, and numerous threads in both gray and white matter. No abnormal inclusions were revealed by beta-amyloid, \u03b1-synuclein and TDP-43 immunohistochemistry. In our case, cerebral infarction, periventricular and deep white matter ischemic changes, and midbrain atrophy were likely to produce PSP\u2013CBD overlapping symptoms. However, our patient was finally confirmed to have CBD based on pathological findings such as astrocytic plaques.\nTae-Mi YOON; Kyung-Hwa LEE.\nInternational Journal of Thyroidology ; : 49-53, 2022.\nAnthracofibrosis is luminal narrowing with a black anthracotic pigmentation on the bronchial mucosa. Extrapulmonary anthracofibrosis is very rare in head and neck region, and anthracofibrosis associated with adhesion to adjacent tissue can be misdiagnosed to malignancy. We report a rare case of a paraesophageal anthracofibrosis in a patient with advanced papillary thyroid cancer. The paraesophageal anthracofibrosis presented as a black colored hard mass with severe adhesion to the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) during thyroid surgery, suspecting metastatic lymphadenopathy. With intraoperative frozen biopsy, unnecessary aggressive surgery with the injury of RLN can be avoided. Permanent histopathological examination of the mass revealed anthracofibrosis with strong positivity on Masson\u2019s trichrome staining. This case highlights that anthracofibrosis should be included in differential diagnosis of paraesophageal masses, and frozen sectional biopsy can help in decision making during surgery. In addition, collagen might be involved in the adhesion of the anthracotic mass to the surrounding tissues.\nBaek-hui KIM; Joon-Mee KIM; Gyeong-Hoon KANG; Hee-Jin CHANG; Dong-Wook KANG; Jung-Ho KIM; Jeong-Mo BAE; An-Na SEO; Ho-Sung PARK; Yun-Kyung KANG; Kyung-Hwa LEE; Mee-Yon CHO; In-Gu DO; Hye-Seung LEE; Hee-Kyung CHANG; Do-Youn PARK; Hyo-Jeong KANG; Jin-Hee SOHN; Mee-Soo CHANG; Eun-Sun JUNG; So-Young JIN; Eunsil YU; Hye-Seung HAN; Youn-Wha KIM.\nJournal of Pathology and Translational Medicine ; : 1-19, 2020.\nThe first edition of the \u2018Standardized Pathology Report for Colorectal Cancer,\u2019 which was developed by the Gastrointestinal Pathology Study Group (GIP) of the Korean Society of Pathologists, was published 13 years ago. Meanwhile, there have been many changes in the pathologic diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC), pathologic findings included in the pathology report, and immunohistochemical and molecular pathology required for the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. In order to reflect these changes, we (GIP) decided to make the second edition of the report. The purpose of this standardized pathology report is to provide a practical protocol for Korean pathologists, which could help diagnose and treat CRC patients. This report consists of \u201cstandard data elements\u201d and \u201cconditional data elements.\u201d Basic pathologic findings and parts necessary for prognostication of CRC patients are classified as \u201cstandard data elements,\u201d while other prognostic factors and factors related to adjuvant therapy are classified as \u201cconditional data elements\u201d so that each institution could select the contents according to the characteristics of the institution. The Korean version is also provided separately so that Korean pathologists can easily understand and use this report. We hope that this report will be helpful in the daily practice of CRC diagnosis.\nSoo-Hyun CHO; Seong-Min CHOI; Byeong-C.

LATE neuropathological change (LATE-NC) is characterized by a TDP-43 proteinopathy that mainly involves the amygdala and medial temporal structures, with or without hippocampal sclerosis. LATE-NC is typically observed in individuals aged 80 years or older and manifests clinically as amnestic memory decline. Herein, we report a case of LATE diagnosed by brain autopsy in an 82-year-old male who had an 11-year history of memory impairment. Pathological examination revealed high Alzheimer disease neuropathological changes, as well as amygdala-predominant Lewy body pathology. In addition, immunohistochemistry for TDP-43 revealed neuronal and glial cytoplasmic inclusions in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, amygdala, and inferior temporal cortex. Increasing awareness of the newly defined entity LATE will enhance our understanding of the neurodegenerative processes that occur in the oldest individuals.\nInkyung PARK; Seong-Min OH; Kyung-Hwa LEE; Soohyun KIM; Jeong-Eun JEON; Ha-Young LEE; Sehyun JEON; Seog-Ju KIM; Yu-Jin LEE.\nPsychiatry Investigation ; : 243-248, 2020."

Laparotomy revealed severe paraesophageal varices in five patients; four of them were found to have paraesophageal varices in computer tomography films. The sensitivity and specificity of computer tomography in diagnosing severe paraesophageal varices were 80% and 100%, respectively. A second assessment was performed in 59 additional patients with esophageal variceal hemorrhage to investigate the influence of paraesophageal varices on the efficacy of endoscopic sclerotherapy in the treatment of varices. The patients were divided into two groups: Group A included 17 patients with and group B 42 patients without paraesophageal varices on presclerotherapy computer tomography. All patients underwent elective sclerotherapy after being deemed hemodynamically stable. Patients in group A required more treatment sessions, more sclerosant and longer periods to obliterate varices completely than did group B patients. Eight patients in group A and six in group B (57% vs. 16%, p < 0.05) had variceal recurrence after obliteration during mean follow\u2010ups of 20.8 and 19.9 mo, respectively. The mean time elapsed before variceal reappearance was shorter for group A than for group B (4.1 \u00b1 3.3 vs. 11.8 \u00b1 2.7 mo, p < 0.05). Among patients who developed new varices, five patients in group A and one in group B experienced repeat bleeding. The repeat bleeding rate was higher for group A than for group B (29% vs. 3%, p < 0.05). In conclusion, computer tomography proved a reliable diagnostic procedure in detecting severe paraesophageal varices in patients with portal hypertension. Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy is less effective in treating patients with esophageal variceal hemor rhage who have severe paraesophageal collaterals.

However, Iron-deficiency anemia is an under-appreciated condition associated with giant PEH. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of iron-deficiency anemia in a cohort of patients with giant PEH and assess the incidence of resolution associated with operative PEH repair.\nBetween 2000 and 2010, 270 patients underwent operative repair of PEH and were prospectively entered into an IRB-approved database. From this cohort, 123 (45.6%) patients demonstrated a pre-existing diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia. 77 patients had a documented pre-operative hemoglobin level (Hb) consistent with iron-deficiency anemia and a follow-up Hb level at least 3 months following surgery and constituted the study population.\nFrom the cohort of 77 patients with documented pre-operative iron-deficiency anemia, 72 (94%) underwent elective PEH repair, with a median age was 75 (range 39-91). Cameron erosions were endoscopically documented preoperatively in 25 patients (32%). The average preoperative Hb value was 11.8 (7.6 - 16). Postoperatively at 3 - 12 month follow-up, the average Hb level was 13.2 (10.7 - 17), and at more than 1 year follow-up it was 13.6 (9.2 - 17.2) (P < 0.05). Furthermore 90% of patients had a rise in post-operative hemoglobin level by at least 1g/dL. Anemia was fully resolved postoperatively (Hb\u226512.0 in females, \u226514.0 in males) in 55 (71%) patients. This resolution was observed more commonly in women (40/50, 80%) than men (15/27, 56%, P < 0.05). Also younger patients (<70 years) were more likely to resolve their anemia (29/33 vs. 26/44; P < 0.05) and have a greater post-operative Hb (14.0 vs. 13.0 g/dL; P < 0.05) than older patients. 40 patients required preoperative iron supplementation, 29 (73%) were able to discontinue iron following surgery. There was no significant difference in the resolution of anemia in patients with or without Cameron erosions (19/25 vs. 36/52, p=0.54).\nThis single institution study shows a high incidence of iron-deficiency anemia (45.6%) in patients with giant PEH. Elective repair results in resolution of the anemia and discontinuation of iron supplementation therapy, in more than 70% of patients. This improvement in Hb is independent of the presence of pre-operative Cameron erosions. This study demonstrates the clinical and potential economic benefits of elective PEH repair of patients with Giant PEH and iron-deficiency anemia.<|endoftext|>Representatives Carolyn Crawford and Richard Bennett both call the coast home.

However, in patients with respiratory failure, who are being mechanically ventilated through an endotracheal tube, EBUS-TBNA may not be feasible due to several reasons. In such patients, the esophageal route offers a useful alternative for accessing mediastinal lesions. Herein, we describe a 50-year-old man with a mediastinal mass, who was being invasively ventilated for respiratory failure. Endoscopic ultrasound (with an echobronchoscope)-guided fine-needle aspiration was performed, which revealed a diagnosis of small cell carcinoma. Appropriate cancer chemotherapy resulted in successful liberation of the patient from mechanical ventilation. We have also performed a systematic review of literature for reports of endoscopic diagnostic procedures for mediastinal/hilar lesions in critically ill patients.\n\n\nIntroduction\nEndosonographic procedures, including endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) are routinely used for accessing mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes and masses. [1,2] In patients with hypoxemia, excessive cough, raised intracranial tension, or with central airway obstruction due to lesions compressing the trachea; EUS-FNA may be safer than EBUS-TBNA as it employs the esophageal route. [3] However, patients with central airway obstruction requiring mechanical ventilation are often managed in respiratory care units, where EUS-FNA may not be available. In this situation, the pulmonologist can use the EBUS scope for performing a technique known as EUS (with an echobronchoscope)-guided FNA (EUS-B-FNA). This procedure has been reported to have a good diagnostic performance in the evaluation of mediastinal lesions. [3,4] Herein, we describe a patient with respiratory failure due to airway obstruction by a mediastinal tumor, who was being mechanically ventilated. The diagnosis could be successfully established using EUS-B-FNA.\n\nCase Report\nA 50-year-old man presented to the emergency department with stridor of 1-week duration. He also complained of progressive cough and breathlessness for 2 months. There was a significant reduction in appetite and he had lost 5 kg of his body weight. On admission to our facility, the patient was drowsy. Physical examination revealed an afebrile patient with a heart rate of 120 beats/min, respiratory rate of 38 breaths/min, and blood pressure of 80/50 mmHg. His oxygen saturation was 91% while breathing 40% oxygen. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of his chest revealed the presence of a mass in the subcarinal region encasing the lower trachea and main bronchi and consolidation in the right upper lobe [ Figure 1].\nThe patient was intubated with an endotracheal tube (7.0 mm internal diameter) and mechanically ventilated. Resuscitation with fluids and vasopressors was performed. He was initiated on intravenous co-amoxiclav (1.2 g thrice a day). Shock recovered after 48 h and tachycardia resolved. However, the patient could not be weaned off the ventilator over the next 5 days. On the 6 th day, EUS-B-FNA of the subcarinal mass was performed. Cytological examination showed loosely cohesive clusters and dispersed population of small-sized tumor cells with hyperchromatic nuclei showing focal nuclear molding suggestive of small cell carcinoma of the lung [ Figure 2].\nThe final clinicoradiological stage was IIIb (T4 N3 M0), but the patient had a poor performance status (Eastern cooperative oncology group score of 4). Placement of a metallic tracheobronchial Y-stent was considered but was not performed as the patient's legal representative refused consent. Chemotherapy with cisplatin 100 mg (85% of 60 mg/m 2 of body surface area [BSA]) and irinotecan 160 mg (90% of 100 mg/m 2 of BSA) were administered. After a week, the patient was successfully weaned off the ventilator and was discharged to home care. The patient received three more cycles of chemotherapy. However, the disease progressed and the patient succumbed to his illness 3 months after the diagnosis.\n\nDiscussion\nThe index case illustrates the utility of EUS-B-FNA in accessing mediastinal lesions in mechanically ventilated patients, where EBUS-TBNA may be technically difficult or not feasible. A diagnosis of advanced lung cancer was made and the administration of palliative chemotherapy enabled liberation from mechanical ventilation.\nEUS may be useful in such patients as the access is through the esophagus, thus not compromising ventilation. [8][9][10][11] EUS offers access to lymph node stations 5 (para-aortic), 8 (paraesophageal), and 9 (pulmonary ligament) in addition to stations 4 L (left lower paratracheal) and 7 (subcarinal). However, this procedure is usually performed by gastroenterologists and many respiratory Intensive Care Units may not have easy access to this technology, especially at the bedside. EUS-B-FNA, which is performed by the pulmonologist with the same echobronchoscope used to perform EBUS-TBNA overcomes this limitation. Moreover, the introduction of the EBUS scope (6.9 mm in diameter) may be easier than the introduction of the EUS scope (12-14 mm in diameter) in patients who also have esophageal narrowing. [12] Due to these reasons, EUS-B-FNA was preferred in the index patient. CT-guided FNA was not employed as it would have entailed a high risk of pneumothorax due to the central location of the mass.\nA systematic review of the PubMed database using the search string: (EBUS OR \"endobronchial ultrasound\" OR \"endoscopic ultrasound\" OR echobronchoscope OR echoendoscope OR endosonography OR \"transbronchial needle aspiration\") AND (ICU OR \"intensive care unit\" OR \"critically ill\" OR \"mechanical ventilation*\" OR \"mechanically ventilated\" OR intubated OR \"endotracheal tube\") yielded 10 reports (62 patients) of endoscopic interventions (conventional TBNA, EBUS-TBNA, EUS-FNA, or EUS-B-FNA) for mediastinal/ hilar lesions in critically ill patients [ Table 1]. [5][6][7][8][9][10][11][13][14][15] Forty-six patients could be diagnosed successfully resulting in an overall yield of 74.2%; there were no major complications. Moreover, the diagnostic information obtained from the procedure led to a change in the treatment decision in most of these patients (49/62; 79%). In our case, EUS-B-FNA allowed institution of appropriate chemotherapy and facilitated liberation of our patient with advanced lung cancer from mechanical ventilation, an event not commonly encountered in clinical practice. [16]\n\nConclusion\nThe index case demonstrates that EUS-B-FNA is a valuable addition to the armamentarium of the pulmonologist for diagnosing mediastinal lesions in critically ill patients, including situations such as respiratory failure, which preclude a diagnostic bronchoscopy and EBUS-TBNA.\n\nFinancial support and sponsorship\nNil.\n\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts of interest.<|endoftext|>This book contains some excellent and stimulating historical analysis. But its main arguments are not always easy to identify because it is often a victim of its own erudition and it frequently allows factual digression to obscure its most important claims. Its intentions are generally to examine the emergence of a modern intellectual and political culture in 19th-century Prussia and after 1871 in Germany as a whole, and, more specifically, to assess the contribution of academic theology to the consolidation of this culture. Its primary topics are consequently the University of Berlin and its theology faculty. However, its focus wanders periodically and the author ruminates shapelessly on various matters from the dissemination of German theology in other countries to students who studied in Germany then later founded universities and theology faculties outside Germany.\nThe book also contains some methodological ambiguities. At one level, it can be read as an essay in the historical sociology of religion and religious education. It uses quasi-sociological approaches to show how religious teaching in the universities of 19th-century Prussia adapted to the emergence of a mass market in higher education resulting from \"rapid population growth\", from \"improved literacy\" and from the expectation of the new middle class that universities would act as \"avenues of social mobility\". At the same time, however, Thomas Albert Howard is motivated by a discerning and understated care for religion, and he never finally decides whether the integration of religion into the structures of mass society and the rationalisation of theology as a scientific discipline should be documented as signs of the continuing relevance of religion in modern social life or lamented as a betrayal of its founding commitment to Heilsgeschichte and to the ideals of Christian antiquity.\nUltimately, however, it is most"

It is essential to clearly establish the etiology as a end result of the administration is different.

Phenoxybenzamine is an alpha-1 receptor antagonist used in the preoperative administration of pheochromocytoma (D).\nDespite the advantages, the radiocephalic fistula has a better early failure or nonmaturation rate and may not be a great choice in diabetics because of medial calcinosis within the radial artery. A forearm loop graft additionally has the advantage of dilating the basilic and upper cephalic veins for future fistula creation.

The cardiovascular results of arteriovenous fistulas in chronic kidney disease: a cause for concern Risk components for steal syndrome include diabetes, age > 60, and use of the brachial artery. Proximal fistulas have a better danger of developing steal syndrome whereas distal wrist fistulas (Cimino fistulas) have a really low danger. This is probably going due to the fact that the large diameter of the graft creates a low-resistance bed. The steal syndrome is brought on by a diversion of blood flow from the anastomosed artery to the low-resistance vein. In addition, the low-resistance venous anastomosis results in blood flowing in a retrograde style from the distal circulation into the fistula. The best therapy that maintains fistula perform is distal revascularization and interval ligation. The primary disadvantage of this method is that inadequate banding results in persistent steal, and excessive banding causes graft thrombosis (D, E). Hemodialysis-related steal syndrome: predictive elements and response to treatment with the distal revascularization-interval ligation procedure. When everlasting hemodialysis access is required, the nondominant arm (E) must be considered first so as to 7. A high proportion of patients with end-stage renal disease have central vein stenosis (25\ufffd40%) as a end result of prior central venous access. Central venous stenosis complicates hemodialysis entry as a outcome of it impairs venous fistula outflow and may reduce move charges and reduce probability of maturation in fistulas. Arteriovenous grafts usually have a tendency to cause symptoms than fistulas, and higher arm access is more prone to cause signs than forearm access. When central stenosis is suspected, either from history or signs, central venogram should be performed to diagnose the lesion. Concomitant endovascular venoplasty is an affordable option and has a high price of success. Long-term results of stent-graft placement to treat central venous stenosis and occlusion in hemodialysis patients with arteriovenous fistulas. Central venous stenosis is extra often symptomatic in hemodialysis patients with grafts compared with fistulas. Vascular-Access 235 bleeding from the fistula prompts consideration for revision by resection and plication or reanastomosis with a healthy vein (B). Arteriovenous fistula can ultimately undergo aneurysmal degeneration over time, and intervention is required to forestall rupture and exsanguination (E). High outflow resistance is a common reason for aneurysm formation and have to be ruled out by fistulogram. Repeated needle cannulation could cause stenosis resulting in larger pressures distal to the lesion and subsequent aneurysm formation. Alternatively, repeated needle cannulation can even lead to aneurysmal degeneration of the vein at the stick site. Fistulogram is diagnostic of the stenotic lesion and potentially therapeutic by way of venoplasty with or with out stent placement. Further, fistulogram may also assist distinguish between a true and pseudo aneurysm. If no lesion is seen on fistulogram, a central venogram should be performed to rule out a central stenosis as a reason for high outflow pressures. After remedy of the venous stenoses, bleeding may resolve because the abnormally excessive pressures inside the fistula return to regular.

That strategy has earned accolades and Academy Award nominations (and wins) to a degree that suggests providing real artists with resources and autonomy is a winning formula. However, with regard to blockbusters, the opposite has been true\u2014given millions (if not hundreds of millions) to go gonzo to their heart\u2019s delight, the majority of Netflix\u2019s action directors (Rawson Marshall Thurber, Shawn Levy, Peter Berg) have fashioned flat, personality-deficient snoozes.\nThe prime exception to that rule is Michael Bay, whose 6 Underground came and went without a peep in late 2019 even though, on a technical level, it was as gloriously excessive as anything he\u2019s done. Three years later, Bay\u2019s Ryan Reynolds-headlined extravaganza continues to feel like a casualty of poor marketing (ie Netflix failing to promote its original material both in the press and on its own homepage) more than an artistic miscalculation. Nevertheless, its underperformance further implies that Netflix needs to treat action differently than drama, exerting more stringent quality control over its productions in order to make sure that they\u2019re not flailing about in haphazard directions. In other words, no one needed to look over Scorsese\u2019s or Campion\u2019s shoulders, but perhaps a bit more of that would have done a Red Notice or a Spenser Confidential some good\u2014a tack that Marvel takes, to the tune of untold billions, on all its outsized CGI-ified endeavors.\nOf course, Marvel\u2019s neuter-the-director, assembly-line approach to moviemaking rarely begets masterpieces (and has recently led to a few serious missteps of its own). Still, it has helped the comic-book giant ascend to the apex of the industry, all while avoiding the sorts of action-adventure duds that Netflix all too regularly churns out. Its latest, The Gray Man, will likely satisfy many but wow few.

Eighteen months after the initial presentation, disease recurred in the patient\u2019s neck. The patient underwent resection to control the metastases, with a plan to follow with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the patient became unwell and died at 21\u2009months after initial diagnosis. This demonstrates a need for continued research and reporting on this uncommon disease entity.\n They are composed of cells that contain dense core granules, hence the prefix \u2018neuro\u2019, and have secretory abilities, described by the term \u2018endocrine\u2019. While circulating biomarkers such as chromogranin A (CgA) and neuron specific enolase (NSE) can increase with the presence of a NET, the measurement of these peptides is not recommended for screening as they are unspecific markers and can be elevated due to other clinical conditions. For instance, CgA can be elevated in patients that are taking a proton pump inhibitor or in those with renal insufficiency, while NSE can be raised due to the presence of small-cell lung carcinoma [1]. Therefore, diagnosis requires tissue biopsy and the presence of neuroendocrine markers such as CgA, NSE, and synaptophysin on histological examination. The most common anatomical origins of these tumors are along the gastrointestinal tract and within the bronchopulmonary segments. Rarely, these tumors can occur intracranially, with nine reported cases of primary origin in this site [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. Pineal gland origin is even less common, with only one previous case having been reported [2]. Pineal region tumors, given their proximity to the cerebral aqueduct, can lead to obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow, resulting in downstream effects such as hydrocephalus. To our knowledge, this is the second case that has been reported of a neuroendocrine carcinoma originating in the pineal region.\nA previously healthy 53-year-old male was admitted to hospital after presenting with a five-day history of intractable vomiting, generalized weakness, and ataxia. Additionally, he reported that he had been experiencing severe headaches. The patient had an unremarkable medical history, with hypertension as his only medical condition. On physical examination, he appeared lethargic and was frequently retching and vomiting. The only neurological findings were bilateral papilledema and impaired upward and downward gaze. Due to the patient\u2019s condition, his gait could not be safely assessed. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans revealed hydrocephalus secondary to an outflow obstruction of the third ventricle. The obstructing mass measured 2.5\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u20093.2\u2009cm and appeared hyperdense, demonstrating enhancement with contrast. It was centred in the pineal region and had central calcification. There was mass effect on the adjacent midbrain. The midbrain was edematous, possibly indicating invasion. The remainder of the brain appeared normal (Fig. 1A, B).\nThe patient underwent endoscopic biopsy and endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV). An external ventricular drain (EVD) was placed due to moderate tumor bleeding during the biopsy. This drain was then weaned and removed on post-operation day three after a CT head showed improvement in the patient\u2019s hydrocephalus. After the biopsy was reported as a malignancy, we offered the patient surgical resection of the tumor. We performed a craniotomy through the occipital bone. A supracerebellar, infratentorial approach was used to achieve a subtotal resection.\nThe patient developed a communicating hydrocephalus while recovering after the resection, requiring an EVD. The EVD became blocked twice, requiring reinsertion of the drain. The second time the drain blocked, the patient became drowsy, prompting us to place a permanent ventriculoperitoneal shunt. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was not placed during the resection surgery as the non-communicating hydrocephalus was adequately treated with the ETV.\nHistological analysis of the biopsied and resected tumor tissues presented a diagnostic challenge, given the rarity of primary neuroendocrine tumors of the pineal gland. The initial differential diagnosis included pineal parenchymal tumors, such as a pineoblastoma, as well as metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma. The tissue was evaluated by four external pathologists, as well as a local Neuropathologist, and diagnosed as a neuroendocrine carcinoma based on the cytokeratin and synaptophysin positivity. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) demonstrated fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity in the pineal gland with no evidence of another primary site, strongly suggesting that this was a primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the pineal gland. It is worth mentioning that PET/CT revealed a small incidentaloma \u2013without FDG avidity \u2013 in the upper pole of the left kidney suggestive of renal cell carcinoma (RCC).\nDuring his hospitalization, the patient was found to have hypercalcemia and elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH). Consultation with an Endocrinologist revealed that he had primary hyperparathyroidism. Two months after his initial presentation, the patient had lost 24\u2009kg, and was unable to speak or sit up in bed but retained the ability to move all limbs independently. At that time, the patient\u2019s performance status was Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 4 and he was not a candidate for further therapy. After discussions with the patient and his family, the patient was transferred home for palliative care.\nOver the subsequent months, the patient\u2019s condition improved significantly. He was reassessed and treated with craniospinal radiation in two phases (5400\u2009cGy in 30 fractions to the residual enhancing tumor and resection cavity, and 3600\u2009cGy in 20 fractions to the craniospinal axis). Post-radiation, the plan was to administer systemic therapy with palliative intent to slow disease progression and maintain quality of life. Approximately 8 months after his initial presentation, the patient\u2019s performance status improved to ECOG-2 and he received his first cycle of chemotherapy (temozolomide 150\u2009mg/m2 given orally daily for 5\u2009days of a planned 28-day\u2009cycle). Unfortunately, he did not tolerate the drug well and was admitted to hospital for 5 weeks. Systemic therapy was discontinued. The patient recovered at home, and it was decided, in consultation with the patient and family, that surveillance would be the preferred approach.\nEighteen months after his initial presentation, the patient developed a rapidly growing lesion on his posterior neck that tripled in size over 2 months. MRI showed at least four enhancing lesions in the soft tissue of the neck (Fig. 2). The lesion that was clinically palpable measured 56\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u200935\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u200955\u2009mm and was located left of the midline of the posterior neck (Fig. 2A). The second lesion was in the left posterior neck at level Vb, measuring 16\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u200917\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u200917\u2009mm (Fig. 2B). The third lesion was located on the right posterior neck at level Vb, measuring 22\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u200918\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u200920\u2009mm (Fig. 2C). The fourth lesion was paraesophageal on the left at level VI, measuring 10\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u200918\u2009mm (Fig. 2D). The smaller lesions were likely lymph node metastases. A biopsy of the largest lesion was performed, and histology was highly suggestive of a metastatic lesion from the original pineal tumor. The treatment plan at this time was local resection, followed by radiation to control the metastases and potential platinum-based chemotherapy. The clinically palpable neck mass was surgically excised from the soft tissue 3 months after it was initially identified. Unfortunately, the patient became unwell prior to starting radiation and died 21\u2009months after his initial diagnosis (Table 1).\nThe gross total pineal tumor was soft, tan, and hemorrhagic. Microscopic examination of the biopsied and resected tissues from the pineal region revealed that they were similar in composition, and both included a highly cellular neoplasm composed of primitive-looking round cells with finely dispersed granular chromatin, indistinct nucleoli, and scanty cytoplasm (Fig. 3A). The cells were arranged in diffuse sheets and trabeculae. There were focal papillary arrangements and vague rosettes. Mitotic activity was brisk with 20 per 10 high power fields. Atypical mitotic forms were also seen. Immunohistochemistry was performed and the tumor cells were strongly positive for synaptophysin, neuron specific enolase (NSE), cytokeratin (CK) 8/18, CK AE1/AE3, and CK CAM 5.2 (Fig. 3B, C, D). There was focal positivity for chromogranin, S100, and neurofilament (NF). There was no staining for PTH, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), CK 7, CK 20, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2). Integrase interactor 1 (INI1) nuclear staining was intact. The Ki67 index was estimated to be 60\u201370%.\nThe slides were scanned using the Leica Aperio AT2 scanner and viewed with the Leica eSlideManager software. The images were acquired at a magnification of 20X and resolution of 0.50uM/pixel. No digital enhancements or adjustments were performed on any of these images.\nNETs arise from Kulchitsky cells, a type of enterochromaffin cell mostly located in the gastrointestinal and bronchopulmonary tracts, resulting in a propensity for tumours in these locations.

Except for FVC in NYHA Class IV (32.3% improvement, P < 0.05), the changes were statistically insignificant. Conclusions: Pulmonary functions deteriorate immediately after surgery and then recover gradually over a period of 3 months. However, they remain below the predicted values.\nWe report a case of an adult male who presented with recurrent massive hemorrhagic pleural effusion with a mediastinal cyst due to an unusual complication of pancreatic pseudocyst-like pancreaticopleural fistula and a mediastinal pseudocyst. The clinical presentation was misleading since the patient presented with predominantly respiratory complaints. High index of suspicion of pancreatic etiology in recurrent massive hemorrhagic pleural effusion may lead to the diagnosis.\nBackground: Spirometry measures the mechanical function of lungs, chest wall and respiratory muscles by assessing the total volume of air exhaled from total lung capacity to residual volume. Spirometry and peak flow measurements have usually been carried out on separate equipments using different expiratory maneuvers. Aims: The present study was carried out to determine whether there is a significant difference between peak expiratory flow (PEF) derived from a short sharp exhalation (PEF maneuver) and that derived from a full forced vital capacity (FVC) maneuver in healthy volunteers. Settings: A medical college and tertiary level hospital. Materials and Methods: The present study was carried out during the period from January 2006 to July 2006. The study included 80 healthy volunteers with no coexisting illnesses, who were in the 15-45 years age group and belonging to either sex. They were asked to perform two sets of PEF and FVC maneuvers using the same turbine spirometer; the order was randomly assigned.th Statistical Analysis: The difference between PEF obtained from a peak flow maneuver (PEFPF) and that obtained from a forced vital capacity maneuver (PEFVC) in healthy volunteers was analyzed separately for males and females, as well as for both groups combined, and statistical significance of its correlations with study data parameters was analyzed.th Results: The difference between PEF obtained from a peak flow maneuver (PEFPF) and that obtained from a forced vital capacity maneuver (PEFVC) was statistically significant ( P < 0.001) in males and in females separately and also for both groups combined. PEFPF (517.25 \u00b1 83.22 liters/min) was significantly greater than PEFVC (511.09 \u00b1 83.54 liters/min), as found on combined group mean analysis. However, the difference was small (6.16 + 7.09 liters/min). Conclusions: FVC maneuver can be used over spirometers to detect the PEF; and on follow-up subsequently, the same maneuver should be used to derive PEF. If we are using a peak flow maneuver subsequently, corrections are required to compensate for the difference due to the different maneuver.\nHydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) that is mainly generated by neutrophils and eosinophils in asthma is known to be damaging to the airway and to contribute to airway inflammation. The purpose of the present study was to determine the contribution and the role of lactoperoxidase in scavenging airway hydrogen peroxide, in order to propose a therapeutic approach for asthma. The study was an open clinical trial. Twenty-five nonsmoking asthmatic patients were included in the study. Of them, 16 patients (64%) were male and 9 (36%) were female, with age ranging from 29 to 48 years (45.13 \u00b1 4.6). Of the 25 patients included in the study, only 16 patients completed the study; and they were eligible for analyses. Exhaled breath condensate was collected from all patients at the time of entering the study; and 2, 4 and 8 weeks later. All patients received dapson as a lactoperoxidase inhibitor at a dose of 50 mg daily for 8 weeks. The study was conducted during the period from January 2006 to end of October 2006. H 2 O 2 concentration was determined by an enzymatic assay. Determination of exhaled breath condensate for hydrogen peroxide concentration after 8 weeks of dapson usage indicated an increase (1.05 \u00b1 0.36 \u00b5M; 95% CI, 0.89-1.21) as compared to that at baseline ( P < 0.0001), 2 weeks ( P < 0.001) and 4 weeks ( P > 0.05). The increase in hydrogen peroxide concentration in exhaled breath condensate after inhibition of lactoperoxidase by dapson advocates a potential role for lactoperoxidase in scavenging of hydrogen peroxide in asthmatic airway.\nBackground : New information is available on pleural diseases. The authors selected articles to make recommendations on diagnostic and treatment aspects of pleural diseases. Materials and Methods: Eleven articles published in the English language between 2004 and 2007 were chosen. The basis of selection of the articles was the impact on daily practice, change in prior thinking of a disease process or specific treatment modality, as well as proper design and execution of the study. 5-amino-laevulinic acid with fluorescent light combined with white light may allow further diagnostic yield in undiagnosed pleural disease. FDG-PET may allow prognostication of patients with pleural tumors. Utilizing ultrasound by trained Emergency Department physicians is a rapid and effective technique to evaluate non-traumatic pleural effusions in symptomatic patients. Serum osteopontin levels may distinguish patients exposed to asbestos with benign disease from those with pleural mesothelioma. Administration of streptokinase in patients with empyema does not need for surgical drainage, length of hospital stay, or mortality as compared to conventional treatment with chest tube drainage and intravenous antibiotics. Silver nitrate may be an alternative agent to talc for producing pleurodesis. Routine use of graded talc (50% particles greater than 25 microns) is recommended to reduce the morbidity associated with talc pleurodesis. Study design does not permit us to conclude that aspiration of spontaneous pneumothorax is as effective as chest tube drainage. Pleural catheter may prove to be an important palliative modality in treating debilitated patients or patients with trapped lung who show symptomatic improvement with drainage; however, at the present time, these catheters cannot be considered a first line treatment option for patients with malignant pleural effusion. One of the studies reviewed showed no significant difference in tract metastasis in patients with malignant mesothelioma undergoing an invasive pleural procedure with or without irradiation to the procedure site. However, the design of the trial does not allow us to make this conclusion at the present time.\nA 7-year-old male presented with history of low-grade fever, epigastric pain and dysphagia. Ultrasound of abdomen and thorax revealed presence of paraesophageal lymphadenopathy. 'Barium swallow' and computerized tomography scan thorax with oral contrast suggested a provisional diagnosis of paraesophageal diverticulum. Esophagoscopy was normal. Endoscopic ultrasonography with biopsy confirmed tuberculosis. The patient was started on four-drug antitubercular treatment.\nObjective: The aim of this study was to evaluate asthma control after the introduction of a leukotriene modifier (Montelukast), in addition to the current controller asthma therapies, in patients with inadequately controlled mild-to-moderate persistent asthma. Asthma control and patient perception were assessed prior to, and 4 weeks after, the introduction of Montelukast, and the pre-introduction and post-introduction results were compared. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional, observational study collected information on 1,490 eligible adult asthmatic patients in Saudi Arabia. The eligibility criteria included patients aged 15 years or more with symptomatic mild-to-moderate persistent asthma despite treatment with inhaled corticosteroids with or without long-acting beta agonist; also, the patient should attend the initial visit and follow-up visits after at least 4 weeks. Results: Of the 1,490 eligible patients, 79.5% received inhaled corticosteroids alone, and the remaining 20.5% received combination of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilator. Despite the treatment with daily controller medications, asthma symptoms persisted in more than two-thirds of the study population. Upon adding Montelukast, more than 80% of patients reported improvement in symptoms, which was consistent in all patients irrespective of corticosteroid type or dose (stratum) or the addition of long-acting \u03b22-agonist. At the follow-up visit, 92.2% of patients reported that they felt better on Montelukast. Conclusion: Leukotriene modifier Montelukast has significant additive benefits in the management of patients who suffer from mild-to-moderate asthma and who are inadequately controlled on inhaled corticosteroids therapy with or without long-acting bronchodilator.<|endoftext|>Sweet with a mild acidity this full bodied coffee has a hint of chocolate and a slight sweetness in the finish.

Chemoradiotherapy has an important role in the treatment of EC in both the inoperable and the pre-operative settings. However, regarding the target volume for radiation, different clinical practices exist. Theoretically, in addition to the clinical target volume administered to the gross lesion, it might seem logical to deliver a certain dose to the uninvolved regional lymph node area at risk for microscopic disease. However, in practice, it is difficult because of the intolerance of normal tissue to radiotherapy (RT), particularly if all regions containing the cervical, mediastinal, and upper abdominal nodes are covered. To date, the use of elective nodal irradiation (ENI) is still controversial in the field of radiotherapy. Some investigators use involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT) in order to reduce treatment-related toxicities. It is thought that micrometastases can be controlled, to some extent, by chemotherapy and the abscopal effects of radiation. It is the presence of overtly involved lymph nodes rather than the micrometastatic nodes negatively affects survival in patients with EC. In another hand, lymph nodes stationed near primary tumors also receive considerable incidental irradiation doses that may contribute to the elimination of subclinical lesions. These data indicate that an irradiation volume covering only the gross tumor is appropriate. When using ENI or IFRT, very few patients experience solitary regional node failure and out-of-field lymph node failure is not common. Primary tumor recurrence and distant metastases, rather than regional lymph node failure, affect the overall survival in patients with EC. The available evidence indicates that the use of ENI seems to prevent or delay regional nodal relapse rather than improve survival. In a word, these data suggest that IFRT is feasible in EC patients.\nEsophageal carcinoma (EC) is a highly lethal disease that has two predominant histological types: adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). These two predominant types may be different diseases, each with a distinct pathogenesis, epidemiology, prognosis and tumor biology, including the pattern of lymph node metastasis [1]. Globally, SCC is the more common histology and the incidence of esophageal cancer is 10 times higher in certain geographic areas in Asia than it is in the U.S., particularly in the \u201cAsian esophageal cancer belt\u201d, which extends from northeast China to the Middle East. Indeed, SCC accounts for 95 % of all ECs in China. Approximately 90 % of all ECs arise in the thoracic esophagus, with the middle thoracic esophagus being the most frequent location [2].\nChemoradiotherapy (CRT) has an important role in the treatment of EC in both the inoperable and the pre-operative settings. Radiotherapy (RT) alone is reserved for palliation or for patients who cannot receive concomitant chemotherapy. Although the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements gives suggestions for RT planning, some RT factors are controversial, such as the radiation doses and target volumes. For preoperative therapy, 40\u201345 Gy is delivered in 1.8\u20132.0 Gy/day fractions in most studies. For patients undergoing definitive CRT, 50.4 Gy is the accepted standard dose based on randomized data from Europe and North America [3, 4]. Although radiation dose-escalation has failed to improve local control or survival, a dose of 60 Gy is more popular in Asian countries where SCC is the predominant histological type [5, 6]. On the other hand, the target volume of external beam radiation therapy and its coverage are controversial among radiation oncologists. To date, no universally accepted opinion regarding the extent of the RT field has been established, especially for the clinical target volume (CTV). In theory, the CTV includes the gross tumor volume (GTV) in addition to areas at risk of a microscopic metastasis of the disease. For the CTV of a primary tumor, cranial and caudal margins of 3\u20135 cm and radial margins of 1\u20131.5 cm are generally used considering submucosal spread [4, 7, 8]. However, for the lymph node CTV, there are various clinical practices. In the era of two-dimensional RT, it has been standard practice to deliver a certain dose to the uninvolved regional lymph node area at risk for microscopic disease. This is known as elective nodal irradiation (ENI). Despite the high risk of nodal spread in EC, the benefit of additional ENI is controversial, especially for overall survival (OS). With the understanding of the biologic characteristics of tumors, technological and chemotherapeutic advances have progressively changed the practice of RT, which has been adopted for treating locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer [9], small cell lung cancer [10], non-Hodgkin lymphoma [11], and Hodgkin lymphoma [12] in the form of involved-field RT (IFRT). New advances in CRT for EC have also come from research into novel ways to minimize toxicity and maximize efficacy. In fact, a few studies [13\u201317] have used IFRT in definitive CRT or pre-operative CRT for EC patients with either early or locally advanced staged disease. In these studies, all the lymph nodes that were clinically involved were included in the GTV. No prophylactic irradiation was administered to the non-involved regional lymph nodes. However, IFRT is controversial for the increased risk of nodal failure in untreated nodal stations, as clinically uninvolved lymph nodes may harbor microscopic disease.\nIn this review, the main arguments for omitting ENI in EC patients are discussed, with a particular focus on esophageal SCC. The topics covered include the lymphatic drainage of the esophagus, lymph node micrometastases, the effect of chemotherapy and radiation on micro-metastasis, and the failure patterns and OS after definitive CRT.\nEC commonly shows lymph node metastases, particularly regional lymph node involvement, which is an early process. For example, the rate of positive loco-regional nodes is close to 0 % for intra-epithelial tumors, 31\u201356 % for T1b tumors, 58\u201378 % for T2, 74\u201381 % for T3, and 83\u2013100 % for T4 tumors in patients with esophageal SCC [18, 19].\nFor the anatomical lymphatic drainage system of the esophagus, the abundant lymphatic channels in the lamina propria mucosae and submucosa of the esophagus are well known from classic studies. Long longitudinal lymphatic extension in the esophageal submucosa is very evident, and a morphological connection between submucosal lymphatic vessels and recurrent nerve nodes has been observed [20, 21]. The lymphatic routes to the peri-esophageal lymph nodes usually originate from the intermuscular area of the muscularis propria, and lymphatic communication between the submucosa and intermuscular area is rarely apparent histologically [21, 22]. These morphologies suggest an explanation for the anatomically distant lymph node metastasis known as \u2018skip metastasis\u2019 observed in EC. Therefore, in patients with tumors confined to the submucosal layer, even with tumors located in the lower esophagus, lymphatic metastasis frequently occurs in the supraclavicular area. The \u201cdistant\u201d lymph node involvement from superficial carcinoma is thus not necessarily a sign of advanced disease. In the 7th edition of the TNM staging system, regional lymph nodes were redefined as any paraesophageal lymph node, including the cervical and celiac nodes.

Just know, snoozing, hollering, tottering loitering and any other questiona ble behavior won't be allowed. Now kick back and relax!\nGreat food, with great service limited to other things but it\u2019s due to COVID-19.\nAmazing atmosphere, fantastic service and delicious food.\nLove the whole dining experience!\nGreat food, ambiance, service, and they went extra length to keep everyone safe.\nFantastic experience, can't wait to go back, the food was amazing, the atmosphere was absolutely beautiful and our server was incredible. It was one of the best dining experiences I've had in a while..\nA wonderful experience! Our server was so attentive...will highly recommend!\nSuch a nice patio whatever the weather. Great for everyday or a Special occasion.\nI liked this place before the pandemic and have been back several times in the last month. The food is high quality and the atmosphere is great.\nWe were in town visiting our daughter and her boyfriend and stayed at The Garland Hotel. We had brunch at the front yard and it was delicious and the ambience was perfect. I loved the mimosas!\nWent today with 2 other girlfriends. Food was amazing. Ordered a pitcher of mimosas that was delicious. Ambiance was perfect.\nAlways enjoy myself when I'm here!! They have a GREAT brunch!!!! The beignets are so delicious!!!\nFood was great as always. Had the rib eye for two. Wasn't pleased that the cook refused to substitute vegetables instead of the shisito peppers that came with the meal since no one in our party likes shisito peppers. Making the customer happy should be a priority. Atmosphere is beautiful at night. Service was OK. Received better attention from bus boys than our waitress who seemed like she wanted to be somewhere else. Gave the 5 star review for the food and atmosphere.\nGreat food, great service, and beautiful outdoor seating!\nWhat an amazing dinning experience!! I had the distinct honor to be invited to dine here this evening. Despite covid, this establishment took every measure to ensure everyone's safety. After being welcomed and seated to our table, we took in the beautiful ambiance, lush seating and meditative running water. Our server Frankie provided exceptional service and was very invested in making sure our experience was extraordinary, of which it was.\nPotato leek soup and the biscuits were amazing! Highly recommend!\nA spot on outdoor pandemic dining experience. The management and staff have set up and provide the safest and most detailed Covid-19 protocol guideline operation that I\u2019ve seen. Been here multiple times and the execution has been consistent.\nThe food is very good, service attentive and friendly.\nBut most of all the outdoor dining setup and garden like surroundings give off a great vibe. This isn\u2019t one of those temporary parking lot or sidewalk Al fresco places.\nVERY CLEAN! Was anticipating how they are responding to COVID but they are doing a fine job!\nAll in all, the Front Yard was pretty good. The food and sevice were both very good. My only complaint is that we wanted reservations for 7:00 PM, and were told that the only opening was at 5:45. When we got to the restaurant, it was basically empty. When we left at about 7:15, only half the tables were taken.\nWe will try to go back, but, only if we can get the time we request.\nThis was our first time there and I must tell you it will not be our last! We\u2019ve already made reservations for December. We had an amazing time. The food was fantastic, service impeccable and atmosphere felt like home. Five stars!!!\nWe had honestly a very horrible experience. It was my best friends birthday & the service was horrible. The staff was very rude to us the whole time.\nWorst possible place to eat. The service is awful. Employees are disrespectful. I had staff harrassing me and my party when I was trying to celebrate my birthday. I was followed all the way out the door and had 3 security members following me and my party. They wanted around us until our ride got around. Constantly hounding us about our mask when we are off the property. It was extremely uncomfortable and uncalled for. I seriously cant believe that happened to me. Me and my party were in no way distrubing the staff or guest. i was extremely confused the entire night. Im very upset. My birthday was ruined.\nPerfect experience in every way! The ambience is gorgeous and romantic, the food is insanely delicious and the service is amazing. Thank you Frankie for an awesome experience!\nThe atmosphere was gorgeous, so many lights outdoor. The waiter was very friendly and aware of the menu. We got a good spot close to the fireplace. The menu should be probably wider and the 15% service fee was a surprise to us.\nWe had an amazing experience and thoroughly enjoyed our lunch. We came here on a Saturday for my husband\u2019s birthday. Will def come back.\nThe hostess said that they were limiting the tables to 90 min seat times. However, we were probably at our table for 2 hours (minimum). Our dishes were good and we got the pitcher, which is highly recommended. It's such a great value. My friend got the burger and I got the steak & eggs as it was recommended by our server. We were happy with our orders. It did kind of feel like our server forgot about us half way through our meal. She checked on us once our food came out, but left us alone for quite some time. Overall though, we had a nice time and the restaurant truly is practicing the social distancing orders. Thank you!!\nFrom beginning to end it was great service and communication from the host to the server. Everything was very covid friendly and distance from other tables was great. Completely enjoyed the ambience and the food was perfect.\nFantastic outdoor dining! Service and food were excellent.\nWe had a great night out with our friends. The service, food and drinks were wonderful. We would definitely come back to try more items from their menu and relax in their beautiful yard setting.\nSimply beautiful! We had an amazing time! Everyone was extremely welcoming and nice!\nThe outdoor dining was lovely and they had all the right Covid 19 protocols in place.\nFantastic outdoor patio! Amazing food; beside the limited menu every dish was delicious. We'll return soon.\nIn this, our pandemic era, they have all the right moves. Bravi! Food, ambiance, service, and social responsibility are on point. Well done. The Branzino was beautiful. Thank you.\nTables far apart.\nFood was sub par for the price. Ambiance was nice, staff was over the top with covid restrictions.\nSo happy the Front Yard is still serving, you have done an excellent job with making it safe during these difficult times. I can't say enough how much I love and appreciate the vegan menu you offer!\nLove this place. Its my regular dining.\nVery cold outside, but what can you expect during COVID times?\nThis is my favorite place to go before and during COVID. Their staff's guidelines and protocols give me a peace of mind knowing they have considered all safety measures. The way they have expanded their patio area to the parking lot is also gorgeous. The added heat lamps, lounge chairs, string lights, and location not directly near a busy, loud, street is a welcome sight for any one during this unsual time. Thank you to the staff for being so wonderful!\nBonus that they take reservations and now offer FREE parking too.

Diagnosing the condition may take time, as the symptoms can be vague and it may be challenging to figure out what is causing them. Treatment is usually surgery to repair the herniation and prevent strangulation, where part of the bowel becomes trapped in the hernia and dies as a result of not getting enough blood. This surgery can be performed by a general surgeon or a hernia repair specialist and is usually not an emergency procedure.\nIn a spigelian hernia, part of the muscle wall of the abdomen separates. Some patients have a small empty sac in the separated space, while in others, a loop of bowel may slip through. Sporting activities, strain, pregnancy, existing weak spots, and severe coughing or vomiting can all be potential causes of a spigelian hernia. Initially, the patient may notice a lingering dull ache in the area, sometimes interrupted with more sharp pain during bends, twists, and heavy lifting.\nSymptoms of a spigelian hernia may include lower abdominal pain.\nPatients may also develop bowel irregularities in some cases, experiencing diarrhea, constipation, or changes in stool color. People with well developed musculature and minimal abdominal fat sometimes see a small bump where the hernial sac is located, and it is also possible to palpate a soft mass in the abdominal wall. This mass will often move with pressure and can appear intermittent in nature. All of these signs of a spigelian hernia can be helpful diagnostic clues, and a medical imaging study will be requested to look at the abdominal wall and see if a hernia can be identified.\nSurgery will be required to repair a spigelian hernia.\nIn some cases, bowel strangulation occurs, leading to significant abdominal pain, changes to the stool, and issues like nausea and vomiting. If a strangulation develops, surgery to correct it is required immediately to remove the diseased section of bowel before infection and other complications set in. During the surgery, the hernia will also be repaired to prevent future strangulation.\nPatients who hav a spigelian hernia may also develop bowel irregularities.\nThis type of hernia is relatively rare and can occur in people of all ages. In spigelian hernia repair surgery, a doctor will place mesh across the tear, preventing the contents of the abdomen from protruding through the herniation. This also gives the tissue a chance to knit back together, sealing the tear, and the mesh will prevent future herniation in that location. Patients can experience high postoperative pain, and they will need to refrain from heavy physical activity for several weeks after the surgery to give the site time to heal.\nWhat Is a Bowel Infarction?\nWhat are the Most Common Symptoms of a Paraesophageal Hernia?\nWhat are the Most Common Symptoms of a Strangulated Hernia?<|endoftext|>The magnificent Animal Store Alphabet on a 24\u2033x36\u2033 poster; artwork by Rebecca Hamlin is from the Animal Store Alphabet Book, featuring an A to Z collection of the strange and familiar animals people have come to love as pets.

Along with Diamonds are Forever, she also boasts the lungs behind the theme songs for the third Bond film, Goldfinger, and the eleventh installment, Moonraker.\nAccording to the annual show's organizers, Shirley had been chosen as the opening act in celebration of the 60th anniversary of the film franchise.\nThe music legend wore a gold sequined dress\u2014complete with a dramatic cape\u2014to belt out the iconic ballad, teaming the glitzy outfit with drop earrings and her signature, cropped brown hair. Her final note was met with rapturous applause from the star-studded audience, with A-listers (like Lady Gaga) rising to their feet in appreciation of the Cardiff native's talent.\nFans were also quick to praise the British superstar online, with many taking to Twitter to share their thoughts on the spectacular performance.\n\"Dame Shirley Bassey. 85 years young and her voice can still take the roof off a venue. Icon!\" one impressed viewer wrote.\n\"Shirley Bassey singing at the BAFTAs tonight has made my year. 85 years old pulling off a performance like that, looking and sounding sensational, my heart is full,\" another person commented.\nThe latest Bond film, No Time to Die, received five nominations at the Baftas 2022\u2014 including Best Editing, Best British Film, Best Sound, Best Special Visual Effects, and Best Cinematography. Unfortunately, it lost out in four of these categories, only landing the prize for Best Editing.\nBritish actress Lashana Lynch, 34, also won the Rising Star Award for her portrayal of Nomi alongside Daniel Craig in the 2021 thriller.<|endoftext|>Hometown artist Taylor White partners with Google to bring art to life.\nGoogle and the Raleigh Murals Project unveiled their first augmented reality mural in downtown Raleigh in mid-October. You can find this exceptional piece at 410 South Salisbury Street. After presenting traditional murals throughout the U.S.\u2014in cities such as Kansas City, Kansas; Austin, Texas; Louisville, Kentucky; and Nashville, Tennessee\u2014Google needed more. Google chose Raleigh to be the first city for an AR mural after considering exactly what the city of Raleigh signifies: a massive technology hub and a center for innovation, along with some of the best traditional and contemporary artwork in a market. Although augmented reality has been used in a few collaborations including the Star Wars movies, this is the first time AR has been featured at this scale in a public venue.\nsome of the effects in augmented reality.\nVirtual reality entails putting a helmet on over your head and experiencing a completely digital world. The world you see during virtual reality is not visible to the outside world. In February 2018, Google launched ARCore, which enabled users to experience the world in a whole new way.\nAugmented reality inserts digital objects into the physical world by cleverly using the camera on your phone to enhance what you can see. One of the biggest challenges has been the precision of augmentation\u2014pinpointing something in the physical space and making sure it stays in the exact same location while digital objects emerge around it. The level of devices that are available now has made it easier to be more accurate.\nThe Google team called upon hometown artist Taylor White to make their vision a reality. White, whose artwork is mainly focused on human action, explains that this project was a fun privilege for her. The towering piece on Salisbury Street is her biggest work to date, and also her most challenging. White went back and forth with engineers to create something that would maximize the piece as a stand-alone mural, but also wouldn\u2019t overcomplicate the technical aspect. The mural gave White the freedom to paint whatever she wanted while also pushing her beyond her limits as a painter.\nEngineers are trained to make products work, while artists are constantly challenging themselves to bring their pieces to life. The joining of art and technology helps emphasize how the audience views artwork and their reactions. This technology also allows artists to bring their work to a completely new dimension. Not only is this an exciting time for White and a huge milestone in her career, it is also an evolutionary time for the community of Raleigh as a whole. Google hopes to give back to the community through this piece. For local residents as well as for North Carolinians in general, the debut of an AR mural in our city is a huge deal. Years ago you would have seen this come about in San Francisco, maybe L.A. or Manhattan, but not in a smaller city in the South. This project symbolizes a true departure from the ways of the past, and it is only the beginning for augmented reality: Imagine walking down the street and being able to hold your phone up to a restaurant to read a review before walking inside. Or \u201cplacing\u201d a couch in your living room before committing to buy it. Better yet, imagine trying on an outfit while online shopping, all in the comfort of your own home. We should be incredibly proud to have augmented reality introduced first in Raleigh.\nThis fall, Google Fiber is launching several murals in the Triangle, although the others will not feature the AR aspect. In addition to the AR mural in Raleigh, the tech giant has a mural coming soon in Durham as well as one in Cary, which Triangle artist David Eichenberger will create on the parking lot side of The Cary Theater.\nWhat\u2019s next for Taylor White? She will travel to Australia for a six-week residency, has a gallery show in Chicago that at presstime was slated to open in late October, and is working with the town of Wake Forest to develop a new mural expected to go up in May of next year"

A generalized linear model was used to identify predictors associated with the selection of a laparoscopic approach. 49,657 inguinal hernias were repaired by 478 surgeons. Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (LIHR) was used in 8 % of all cases. LIHR was used to repair 28 % of bilateral hernias, 10 % of recurrent hernias, 6 % of unilateral hernias, and 4 % of incarcerated hernias. 268 (56 %) surgeons did not perform any laparoscopic repairs, and 11 (2 %) surgeons performed more than 100 repairs. These 11 surgeons performed 61 % of all laparoscopic cases. Patient factors significantly associated with having LIHR included younger age, fewer comorbidities, bilateral hernias, and recurrent hernias. An open approach is favored for all clinical scenarios, even for situations where published guidelines recommend a laparoscopic approach. Surgeons remain divided on the best technique for inguinal hernia repair: while more than half never perform LIHR, the small proportion who perform many use the technique for a large proportion of their cases. There appears to be a gap between the best practices put forth in guidelines and what surgeons are doing in actual practice. Identification of barriers to the broader uptake of LIHR may help inform the design of educational programs to train those who have the desire to offer this technique for certain cases, and have the volume to overcome the learning curve.\nParaesophageal hernia is a severe form of hiatal hernia, characterized by the upward dislocation of the gastric fundus into the thoracic cavity. In this study, the 1999 National Inpatient Sample dataset of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project was analyzed using data mining techniques to explore disorders associated with paraesophageal hernia. The result of this data mining process was compared with a subsequent expert knowledge survey of 97 gastrointestinal tract surgeons.

During the evaluation, a retrocardiac fluid filled mass was seen by transthoracic echocardiogram. The infant was also found to have a ventricular septal defect and partial anomalous pulmonary venous return. Eventually, a large hiatal hernia was diagnosed on subsequent imaging. The infant ultimately underwent surgical repair of the hiatal hernia at a tertiary care facility. Hiatal hernias have been noted as incidental extracardiac findings in adults, but no previous literature has documented hiatal hernias as incidental findings in the pediatric population.\nMoore, Clint J.; Conley, Devan A.; Berry-Cab\u00c3\u00a1n, Crist\u00c3\u00b3bal S.\nAn incarcerated Amyand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hernia: Shall we apply appendectomy routinely?\nFull Text Available Amyand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hernia is a very rare clinical condition characterized by the presence of a normal or inflammed appendix within the inguinal hernia sac. It may be present as an acute apendicitis inside the sac or incarcerated hernia. Sometimes it may be asymptomatic. We report a case of 70-year-old male patient that was presented to our emergency service with a huge right inguinal mass that was diagnosed as an incarcerated inguinal hernia and underwent operation. The intraoperative findings included small intestinal segment, large omental tissue and mobile cecum with healthy appendix inside the sac. There was no sign of strangulation.

Surgical hernia repair is associated with complications, but no clear predictive risk factors have been identified. The European Hernia Society (EHS) classification offers a structured framework to describe hernias and to analyze postoperative complications. Because of its structured nature, it might prove to be useful for preoperative patient or treatment classification. The objective of this study was to investigate the EHS classification as a predictor for postoperative complications after incisional hernia surgery. An analysis was performed using a registry-based, large-scale, prospective cohort study, including all patients undergoing incisional hernia surgery between September 1, 2011 and February 29, 2016. Univariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression analysis were performed to identify risk factors for postoperative complications. A total of 2,191 patients were included, of whom 323 (15%) had 1 or more complications. Factors associated with complications in univariate analyses (p < 0.20) and clinically relevant factors were included in the multivariable analysis. In the multivariable analysis, EHS width class, incarceration, open surgery, duration of surgery, Altemeier wound class, and therapeutic antibiotic treatment were independent risk factors for postoperative complications. Third recurrence and emergency surgery were associated with fewer complications. Incisional hernia repair is associated with a 15% complication rate. The EHS width classification is associated with postoperative complications. To identify patients at risk for complications, the EHS classification is useful. Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2017.

        "passage": " pastor in his early to mid thirties, concerning issues that were arising at the church in Ephesus. Paul had left Timothy to oversee the work in Ephesus and since he was separated from Timothy, and the church, he wrote 1 Timothy to give him instructions about church issues and leadership. He hoped to return but wrote in the meantime to address the way in which Christians should behave and to teach a young pastor what he should prioritise (4:11-16).\nThe letter as a whole is bracketed by the discussion of false teaching (1:3-7; 6:2-21). The exact nature of the false teaching is unclear. It apparently involved speculation about the law (1:7-11)... Paul's reasoning however is clear: Wrong teaching leads to wrong living while healthy teaching leads to godliness. Paul\u2019s real concern is with the results of false teaching\u2014it promotes speculations (1:4; 6:4), arrogance (6:4), and greed (6:5-10). Paul addresses the content of the false teaching only in passing but focuses on the fact that true Christianity is evidenced by a godly lifestyle, not fruitless talk.\n1 Timothy is a clear call for the church to live out gospel empowered godliness. We need to hear this call today more than ever! Throughout the letter Paul grounds Christian behaviour in the truth of the gospel. The primary theme is that the gospel leads to real and visible change in the lives of those who believe it. It is often thought that the theme is church order, this is included but the sections on church order and offices are simply part of the larger theme that the true gospel, in contrast to false teaching, will always lead to godliness (4:6-7).<|endoftext|>During the months of September and October, we offer a fast and fun season to help our players continue to develop their skills.

For Crane, personally, his interest was mainly driven by family professions, as his mother and grandfather are doctors. He grew up hearing amazing stories of surgeries and saving lives, which added to his interest.\nApproximately every other month, the FiMC gathers to meet and listen to a visiting local doctor speak about their profession and specialty which also allows club members to ask questions. Wise was the third in the series. She is a general surgeon who primarily performs laparoscopic surgery and breast surgery.\nPreceding her presentation, Wise shared with the club a short summary of her journey to becoming a general surgeon, including attending medical school and surviving internship. She also spoke about how her specialty of general surgery allows her more flexibility in her schedule than other specialties may allow. In response to a question, Wise said that there are numerous medical professions that one can pursue, and they all have specific pros and cons. Therefore, she argued, there is a profession for everyone interested in the medical field.\nWise brought several videos of her most common surgery, a laparoscopic repair of a hiatal paraesophageal hernia. The patient\u2019s stomach had bulged through a hiatus, an opening in the diaphragm, where the esophagus is located. Wise performed minimally invasive surgery using laparoscopic techniques to move the stomach out of the chest cavity and back to its proper position. She presented these videos to attendees and explained the procedure.\n\u201cThe video was eye-opening,\u201d said attendee Tiffany Yeung \u201922, \u201cespecially into how much detail and accuracy surgeons need to have.\u201d Wise\u2019s laparoscopes, cameras used in laparoscopic surgery, presented several different positional perspectives of the surgery. Yeung said that the different perspectives allowed her to see how the inside of a body really looks which she had never seen before in such detail. \u201cMy favorite part was when she used a special device to [suture] the organs while inside the body,\u201d she said.\nCrane reflected that something he learned from the presentation was that when doctors perform surgery in the stomach area, they have to fill the stomach and intestines with carbon dioxide so they can see easier. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty crazy watching surgeries,\u201d Crane said, \u201cit makes me respect the profession and the doctors even more than before.\u201d In the future, Crane hopes to host many more doctors for students to meet and listen to.<|endoftext|>[ad_1] Each businessperson would like to target a lot of clients so as to improve the revenue of their product/services and that\u2019s all potential only with marketing options.

Its small pointy leaves remain green in color throughout the season.\nHula Appleblossom Calibrachoa is a dense herbaceous annual with a trailing habit of growth, eventually spilling over the edges of hanging baskets and containers. Its medium texture blends into the garden, but can always be balanced by a couple of finer or coarser plants for an effective composition.\nHula Appleblossom Calibrachoa will grow to be about 12 inches tall at maturity, with a spread of 24 inches. When grown in masses or used as a bedding plant, individual plants should be spaced approximately 16 inches apart. Its foliage tends to remain dense right to the ground, not requiring facer plants in front. This fast-growing annual will normally live for one full growing season, needing replacement the following year.\nHula Appleblossom Calibrachoa is a fine choice for the garden, but it is also a good selection for planting in outdoor containers and hanging baskets. Because of its trailing habit of growth, it is ideally suited for use as a'spiller' in the'spiller-thriller-filler' container combination; plant it near the edges where it can spill gracefully over the pot. Note that when growing plants in outdoor containers and baskets, they may require more frequent waterings than they would in the yard or garden.<|endoftext|>Alker Fibre Optic...\nConsistent excellent results have led Alker to be one of the most trustworthy names in fibre optics.

        "passage": " muscles laterally and then anteriorly, intermittently stretching the carotid artery in the lateral direction and pulling the thyroid medially creates a fluctuation in the central region. The abnormal parathyroid may move within the fat lobule, resembling a buoy floating on the water. Intermittent pressure can also be applied to fatty tissue using a peanut sponge to create a similar effect. [13,77] Although there have been reports that identification of the RLN is not necessary in parathyroid surgery, [77] exposure of the RLN makes a significant contribution to the preservation of the nerve and detection of parathyroid glands in relation to the ITA.\nAs discussed in detail in the anatomy section, many parathyroid glands are located close to the intersection of the RLN with RTA, and the course of the RLN also helps to differentiate between upper and lower parathyroid glands. [79] The lower parathyroid glands are anteriorly located in the region of lower pole of the thyroid and easier to reach and to visualize. Therefore, determination of the lower parathyroids should be attempted first, because the thyroid gland may need to be rotated more medially to explore for the upper parathyroids. Approximately 50% of normally located lower parathyroid glands are situated caudal to the ITA, anteromedial to the RLN, and within an area of about 1cm in diameter, including the inferior, lateral, and posterior parts of the lower thyroid pole. The upper parathyroid glands can be seen more easily by retracting the thyroid medially. Nearly 80% of upper parathyroids are located in an area of 1 to 2 cm in diameter, approximately 1 cm superior to the intersection point between the ITA and the RLN in the cricothyroid joint area near the entry point of the RLN to the larynx, and posterolateral to the RLN. [13] In addition, fatty tissue close to the points of entry of the inferior and superior branches of the thyroid artery into the thyroid may be helpful to localizing the parathyroids. [77] If exploration is performed without seeing the RLN, damage to the RLN can easily occur in this area where it enters the larynx. [13] IONM may make a significant contribution to the detection and tracing of the RLN. [79] If the parathyroid glands cannot be found in the normal anatomical sites, possible embryological and acquired ectopic locations of the glands are investigated. If all 4 parathyroid glands are found to be normal, a fifth supernumerary gland should be considered as the cause of disease and potential locations should be explored. [13]\n\nExploration for Ectopic Parathyroid Glands\nIt is important to determine whether a parathyroid gland that cannot be detected in its normal anatomical site is an upper or lower parathyroid gland because the ectopic areas to be explored will differ. If the missing gland is anteromedial to the RLN, then it is an upper parathyroid, while if the gland is localized posterolateral to the RLN it is a lower parathyroid gland. Exploration for ectopic localization of lower parathyroids: In order to identify ectopic parathyroids, the thyroid must be freed from all surrounding soft tissue connections by retracting it completely in the medial direction. This maneuver allows for visualization of the lower parathyroid glands, often hidden behind the thyroid. It also makes the lateral and medial aspects of the lower pole easily explorable. However, it should be remembered that excessive retraction may cause strain trauma to the RLN. [44] The thyrothymic area should then be examined and, if necessary, the upper part of the thymus should be removed using an incision in the neck. If the gland cannot be identified after these dissections, the presence of a parathyroid located more inferiorly should be suspected. In particular, it should be considered that a pathologically enlarged lower parathyroid gland may have migrated to the anterior mediastinum or may be located in the middle and lower thymus. A thymectomy can be performed by retracting the thymus slightly from the cervical region and bluntly dissecting the distal portion. [80] When dissecting the thymus, the veins leading into the innominate vein should be occluded with ligation or electrocautery. Enlarged parathyroids in the middle and upper thymus can be removed with a cervical thymectomy (Fig. 10).\nA lower parathyroid that cannot be found in the usual ectopic locations in the lower neck raises the possibility of a lower thyroid gland that did not complete its migration or a lower parathyroid gland located at the level of the carotid bifurcation or the hyoid bone. An undescended parathyroid gland, or parathymus, often has remnants of thymic tissue. It is usually located medial to the carotid sheath and if the surgeon does not know of this possibility, it will be overlooked. [81] Another area to be investigated is the carotid sheath. To explore the area, the carotid sheath should be opened from the hyoid bone to the level of the innominate artery on the right and to its projection on the shoulder on the left side. [13] Intravagal parathyroid growth may also occur within the carotid sheath. Although one case of an adenoma that developed from the fourth parathyroid has been reported, [82] intravagal adenomas usually develop from a supernumerary parathyroid. [23] Though the incidence is low, an ectopic gland may also be located intrathyroidally. After excluding all other pos- sible ectopic locations, intraoperative ultrasound can be performed for intrathyroid parathyroidism, or it can be diagnosed by either preoperatively or intraoperatively with a parathormone washout test. There are also reports suggesting use of a blind hemithyroidectomy if there is suspicion of intrathyroidal parathyroidism. [83,84] Other than cases of an ectopic parathyroid gland in the neck, a blind procedure is not generally recommended because it can lead to accidental removal of a normal subcapsular parathyroid or devascularization of normal parathyroids. In addition, intense adhesions that may occur during the postoperative period may create more challenging difficulties for secondary surgery. [13] However, success has been reported in the removal of an adenoma with a thyroidotomy rather than a lobectomy or thyroidectomy in patients with intrathyroidal pathological parathyroid (adenoma) previously detected using imaging modalities. [85] In spite of all these approaches, simultaneous blind sternotomy is generally not recommended in patients who do not have an ectopic parathyroid gland in the neck. Instead, more detailed noninvasive imaging methods should be used in the postoperative period and selective venous catheterization should be considered in patients with negative, uncertain, or conflicting results. However, if the calcium level is more than 13 mg/dL and there is an experienced team, a sternotomy may be appropriate. [80] A total or partial sternotomy that can be extended to the right or left may be performed as necessary.\nExploration for ectopic localization of the upper parathyroids: A search for an ectopic upper parathyroid can be initiated with palpation of the tracheoesophageal groove and paraesophageal area and gentle dissection of this region. Since the upper parathyroids are more stable embryologically, migration of an enlarged gland to the paraesophageal area or the tracheoesophageal groove in accordance with the fascial planes of the neck is not an uncommon finding. In this area, migration may lead to localization behind the ITA.\nMigration may also continue to the upper posterior mediastinum. If the gland cannot be detected in these areas, retroesophageal and retrotracheal areas should be examined by opening the corresponding layers of the deep neck fascia, as mentioned in the open MIP technique. It is more appropriate to start the investigation of the upper parts of the neck after exploration of the mentioned areas. The upper pole vessels of the thyroid will need to be cut and the upper pole liberated to examine the posterior aspect of the upper pole, the region of the upper pole vessels, and the parapharyngeal and retropharyngeal areas. [13,44] The upper parathyroid glands may be subcapsular, in-trathyroidal, or intravagal within the carotid sheath, as is the case with the lower parathyroids. Since the details of these structures are similar to the lower parathyroids they will not be repeated here.\n\nOpen Minimal Invasive Parathyroidectomy Technique\nOpen MIP can be performed with a midline approach, although it is usually applied using a lateral approach, also known as a backdoor technique. A midline, open MIP is performed in a similar manner to unilateral neck exploration, but as mentioned earlier, the intervention is performed only for parathyroid glands with known pathology and terminologically it does not include ipsilateral normal parathyroid exploration. Open MIP with a midline approach may be more advantageous than a lateral MIP in cases of an ectopic localization of lower parathyroids anterior to the trachea or medial to the upper lobe. [38] Lateral or midline open MIP can be performed under general anesthesia, cervical block, or local anesthesia. [86] Open Minimally Invasive Parathyroidectomy\n\nUsing Lateral Approach\nIf the intervention is performed for deep and posteriorly localized parathyroid pathology, this is a better option than the midline approach. [53] It is also a very suitable method for patients who have had a previous thyroidectomy or have recurrent or persistent pHPT.\nThe patient is placed in the normal thyroid surgery position, and the neck can be turned slightly to the opposite side.\nSince the surgical"

And if you\u2019re not singing the Monty Python SPAM song in your head by now, it\u2019s only because you\u2019ve never seen it.\nNeedless to say, this very important holiday entails several days off work. Since I and most of the other expats here have no family or ancestors in Korea, we are free to take this time to travel and relax. With 5 days out of the classroom, it seemed like the perfect chance to explore Jeju. All summer long, any time I mentioned I was going to Jeju for Chuseok, Korean people would go wide eyed with worry and ask, as though inquiring the health of a sick pet, \u201cdid you make all your bookings yet?\u201d. In this way, and perhaps this way alone, it is like Thanksgiving: the dreaded Travel Blackout. Lucky for me, Enjoy Korea made all their arrangements well in advance, and I snatched up the last two seats on the Busan bus way back in June. The price tag seemed unbeatable. The trip included all our transportation, not just to and from Jeju, but around the island to various sightseeing highlights, our accommodation (breakfast buffet included), and the entrance fee to the various attractions we were scheduled to see for around $370USD.\nThe only real hitch was that we were taking the ferry from Mokpo instead of a plane. This meant a 4+ hour bus ride and a 4+ hour ferry ride, plus all the time in the ferry terminal on either end\u2026 we had close to 12 hours from when we left Busan at 3am Wednesday morning to when we arrived at the hotel in Jeju Wednesday afternoon. I dozed on the bus and slept better on the ferry where we could actually lay down. After checking in, the tour bus drove us up to nearby Hyupjae beach. I\u2019m not sure if everything was closed because it was Chuseok or because it was 4 in the afternoon, but we were greeted with lots of interesting looking restaurants that were shuttered and dark. Finally we found a Tonkatsu place where I confused the heck out of the staff by ordering in Korean instead of English. We had a little view of the sea from our table and the food was tasty enough for me, since I hadn\u2019t eaten anything but cookies and a latte all day.\nAfter we ate, we headed down to the water to frolic! The weather was gray, but warm. At first the water seemed chilly, but as I waded in further, I quickly adjusted. This beach was wide and shallow. We walked out for ages from the shore but the water didn\u2019t even come to our hips. There were some Koreans playing in the water as well, but it seemed that only the Westerners wore swimsuits, everyone else went in the water in clothes. I\u2019ve seen this at the beaches in Busan as well, and I\u2019m still not sure what the cultural aversion to swimwear in the ocean is.\nWhen we noticed all the expats leaving the beach, we came inland and rushed back to the buses. It became obvious we were the only ones to have taken a dip and our bus driver gave us an enthusiastic double thumbs up when he saw us come in dripping with our towels wrapped around us and our bare feet caked with sand.\nAfter a quick rinse off in the room, we got down to the poolside in time for a beautifully colored sunset. We finished off our first night in Jeju with a pitcher and some nice conversation by the pool before collapsing into actual beds (instead of the floor mats I had anticipated).\nBreakfast was served starting at 7:30 each morning for 2 hours. I was fearing/expecting a sad continential breakfast of weak coffee and dry pastries, but it turned out to be a long buffet table with Korean and Western foods both hot and cold. The coffee was still weak, but there was a tiny cafe in the lobby, so I figured I could buy a cup after eating. I got in line for the coffee well before bus departure time, but sadly, never made it to the front, so my very full day of waterfalls and museums would have to be done sans caffeine.\nOur first stop that day was Cheonjiyeon where we would walk through the woods and see the most beautiful waterfall on Jeju. Heavens help me, I\u2019m writing the segment about waterfalls from New Zealand elsewhere at this moment and it\u2019s just not a fair comparison. One must take one\u2019s waterfalls each as special and unique without trying to measure any one up. My decision to visit Jeju in September was motivated by the Chuseok special, but also by the idea that September temperatures should be back in the tolerable range. Two small problems with that. One, this was the hottest summer anyone remembers in Korea for a long while, temperatures in Busan regularly went over 30 and reached 35 several days while I was away in the wintery southern hemisphere. This is compared to the highs in previous weather data being something like 28. Second, I failed entirely to account for exactly how much worse humidity makes everything. Weather that says 24 on the thermometer, suddenly feels like 29. Everything in your body swells with fluid retention and it seriously feels like someone\u2019s sucked all the oxygen out of the air. For a while, I was worried this was just me. I knew from my recent trip to New Zealand that I wasn\u2019t just \u201cout of shape\u201d, and that my exhaustion and fatigue in Korea had to be something else. During this holiday, I heard from many other expats (several in as good or better shape than me) how tired they were, how hard the hikes were and other physical complaints. The combination of heat, humidity and low pressure (typhoons a comin\u2019) made many of us feel uncharacteristically bad.\nWhen we arrived at the park, we had limited information on what there was to see along the trails, and I didn\u2019t want to miss this \u201cbest waterfall\u201d. We decided to walk straight to the farthest point and then work our way back in so we didn\u2019t end up far away from the parking lot without time to get back to the bus. We chose this because the maps made it look like there was only one access to the parking lot, at the main entrance\u2026 this turns out not to be true.. I also failed in doing my pre-research because I was just relying on the tour group to fill me in on what I needed to know. Ooops.\nThe retrospective research shows that there are 3 \u201cstages\u201d of this waterfall at three points along the river. The first is not usually falling unless there is heavy rain. It is also not clearly marked, but it IS a beautiful blue pool that is seriously worth spending some time at. We walked past it thinking we\u2019d come back, but only had a few minutes when we did return. Path onward to the second waterfall is beautiful. There are many unique trees which have informative signs in Korean and English in case you\u2019re into botany. There are some slopes and stairs, but they aren\u2019t onerous. The second waterfall is the most visible. The viewing platform is in a good place and it\u2019s not too hard to slip past the ropes and onto the rocks for a photo op or even to dip your toes in the water. Sadly, we didn\u2019t have time for these things either and only managed to snap a few pictures around the one white guy who decided to go swimming and be in everyone\u2019s vacation photos that day.\nOn the way to the 3rd waterfall is a BRIDGE. I use all caps because this thing is massive. It\u2019s beautiful and very much worth going to see, waiting in the line for the photo op spot, and schlepping across. Because of our go-far-first plan, we got to the bridge while it was still largely unoccupied and the line for the best photo spot was short. There were some people setting up vending stands and what seemed like a camp site nearby. There was also another short path to the parking lot.(facepalm) From here, hikers can go across the bridge or continue straight toward waterfall 3. The bridge arches high above the river below, offering some stunning views even in the misty weather. In a small courtyard on the other side is a wishing fountain with 5 animals, each representing a blessing.  If it lands in the jar in the middle, you get your wish. There was also a pagoda and a viewing platform that provided a long distance view of the falls.\nFeeling a bit rushed, we didn\u2019t have time to explore the other trails that led away from this side of the bridge and headed back to the waterfall 3 trail. This trail is all stairs. I\u2019m not unwilling to hike some stairs. I\u2019ve done some stair-a-thons in my time, but never in such soul-sucking humidity. You know how when you get the flu, just getting from your bedroom to the kitchen to make a cup of tea seems like a Hurculean task? It\u2019s like that, but without the other flu symptoms and sauna levels of sweat. I think if I\u2019d gone in the spring or fall these stairs would not have phased me, but being limited on time and trying to hike in the late summer weather made this the most unpleasant section of the walk. Nevertheless, I persevered because I love waterfalls. The final set of stairs passed under an arch of vines and flowers and I was just starting to feel like it was all worth it when we emerged onto the viewing platform.\nI keep saying viewing platform. This is because Koreans don\u2019t like getting involved"
