Building on insights from the resource-based view we developed and tested hypotheses that examine (1) linkage ambiguity as a discrepancy between perceived and measured resource\u2013performance linkages, (2) characteristic ambiguity for resources and capabilities with a high degree of complexity and tacitness, and (3) the negative association between linkage ambiguity and performance. The observations based on the explicit perceptions of 356 surveyed managers were contrasted with the empirical findings of the resource/performance relationship derived by structural equation modelling from the same data sample. The findings validate the presence of linkage ambiguity particularly in the case of resources and capabilities with higher degree of characteristic ambiguity. The findings also provide empirical evidence in support of the advocacy for a negative relationship between intrafirmcausalambiguity and performance. The paper discusses the potential reasons for the disparities between empirical findings and management's perceptions of the key determinants of export success and makes recommendations for future research.<|endoftext|>Back in 2008, Amazon \u2014 somehow \u2014 announced that their MP3 section was going international [1]. It\u2019s been over 5 years now, and I haven\u2019t bought a single MP3 from them. On the contrary, iTunes\u2019 business has expanded its international branches\u2026 and now, at least 20% of my music purchases are coming from them.\nThe rest is divided between 31% in Xiami purchases (of mostly China/Taiwan musicians, as they are better organized), and the 49% between physical albums and other alternate sources for MP3s (like direct downloads, Bandcamp, Soundcloud or CDBaby).\nThe area for film and short film streaming (as well as television, I guess) remains one big gray area, as nothing is really available outside the random film available on MUBI, and maybe iTunes, which does offer films and has expanded its film catalog in my store (it now holds like 5 Asian films!). Besides trying it out for film downloads for WALL*E as a test from the code that came with my physical purchase, I have only bought like\u2026 4 other short films (between animated and live-action), but I\u2019m not big on the service. Though, at $2.99USD for a HD short, it totally beats Amazon\u2019s Instant Video offer of $9.99 for THE SAME short.\nDear Amazon, you got me a little frustrated there.\nNot only because of the price, of course. That, I could maybe deal with because I\u2019m in a blind fandom love search for any film or short that Chulpan Khamatova has been involved. I\u2019ve even turned to totally not-subtitled media (in which case, I have to Google-translate synopsis to -at least- know what I\u2019m going to be dealing with). I\u2019ve often overpaid for imported goods (*coughJapanesecough*).\nI was very close to desperate measures, but I eventually came to my senses and searched for my new favorite actress\u2019 name with the \u201ciTunes\u201d term, and voila! C\u2019est facile! There was a hit\u2026 but would iTunes prompt me for a store location switch upon opening?\nNo, it didn\u2019t! Even though my store ONLY has that one short, it is the one I had been looking for, so I\u2019m pretty darn happy. The problem was my next frustration: the realization that iTunes had totally scrapped the Alert Me option from iTunes 11.\nIt\u2019s THEIR business, not mine! I\u2019m already pretty updated with it anyway.\nNow, would someone point me towards a store (like YesAsia) where I could buy European (this includes Scandinavian and even Russian) films (and music) that has an easy option to search for subtitled goods?\nNext story Black Sabbath \u2013 God Is Dead?<|endoftext|>One of the pleasures of riding on the upper deck of a bus \u2013 street photography in comfort.

The robot, appropriately dubbed Monster Wolf, was installed to scare off wildlife\u2014mainly bears\u2014to stop them from getting near residential areas.\nBears are endogenous to the area and have been spotted in Takikawa and nearby towns before. While they don\u2019t pose a huge risk to residents, they\u2019re definitely hungry at this time of year\u2014fall is when they eat more to bulk up and prepare for winter hibernation. If they were to make their way into the town center or into residential neighborhoods, they\u2019d likely just dig through the garbage cans for food scraps.\nBut if you walked out your door and saw a bear in your yard, you\u2019d probably have a hard time staying calm, as most people would. So Takikawa isn\u2019t taking any chances, preferring to avoid the chaos that stray bears would cause among its residents by setting up this robot laden with sensors and speakers.\nIt\u2019s sort of like a scarecrow, except that if you happened to run into it in the middle of the night\u2014or, heck, even in broad daylight\u2014it would probably haunt your dreams (or nightmares) for years to come.\nInfrared sensors detect when bears or other living creatures enter the area, and in response the robot kicks its scare tactics into action: its eyes light up red and it emits a variety of loud sounds, from howls to gunshots to human voices. It reportedly can make over 60 different sounds, (at least one of which is truly ear-splitting, as you can hear in the video below) and is programmed to mix them up so that bears or other predators won\u2019t get used to any one sound and hence stop being"

Our names are Eun Kyeng Baek and SeriaShia Chatters. We are an evaluation team and doctoral students from the University of South Florida. We have served as internal and external evaluators in program evaluations in university settings. Additionally, we have experience in the development and administration of evaluation tools. Serving as an internal evaluator may be associated with several advantages and disadvantages. It is important to consider the risks and rewards equally. Failing to adequately consider the risks can have serious consequences. The following outline is a guide to help internal evaluators identify possible risks throughout the course of an evaluation and how to manage each risk as it may arise.\nConsider the possible risks to your occupation: If the evaluation results are not favorable, could you lose your job? If an unforeseen event occurs during the course of the evaluation, could it have adverse effects on your reputation? Carefully scrutinize all of the possible risks and plan for the worst case scenario.\nConsider collaborating with an external evaluator: Can the risks you may encounter be transferred? Collaborating with an external evaluator may minimize your risk, maximize the depth of your evaluation, and ensure adherence to ethics.\nCarefully choose which evaluation tools you will use: What is the best way to reduce bias or contamination of the evaluation results? How may your presence impact the results of the evaluation? Consider using tools and techniques that may allow participants to respond anonymously. Be ethical and consider consulting an external evaluator if issues arise.\nBe aware of office politics: Are there hidden agendas? Is there an alternative purpose for your evaluation? Carefully choose your evaluation questions. Ensure documentation doe s not disclose personal information of employees/individuals that may implicate you in the future.\nTrack the evaluation report and monitor the impact: Is the evaluation report being used for the purposes it was not originally intended for? How has the evaluation report impacted the work environment? Keep accurate records of your involvement in the evaluation. Keep all information collected during the course of the evaluation confidential, do not discuss your involvement with coworkers.\nAbove all else, protect yourself. Consider the risks mentioned above, however in some cases the overall risk may be low, but the personal risk may be too much for you to handle. Use your best judgment and ensure you are comfortable with your final decision.\nIf you are a champion of the organization\u2019s core values, you have nothing to lose as an internal or external evaluator.\nHaving been an internal evaluator for 7 years I found that the relationships with my stakeholders were key. Since they regarded me as an expert in evaluation and as an impartial observer (since I didn\u2019t have a stake in whether their programs were successful or not), they were more than willing to discuss what evaluation questions would be most appropriate, and to hear \u2018negative\u2019 findings from the evaluation. Internal politics are certainly a way of life for any internal evaluator, and I made sure to consider organizational agendas and craft my messages in a way that would minimize problems or misuse of evaluation findings.\nHowever, in a supportive context with engaged stakeholders I never felt a need to minimize my risks, keep my involvement in an evaluation secret, and certainly never worried about losing my job based on evaluation findings. By making myself a part of the team on every project I worked with, and by positioning myself as someone who was there to empower the team with information about their program, I never felt \u2018at risk\u2019 in any way. In fact, I think my internal status gave me much more leeway to constructively challenge my stakeholders than I have now as an external evaluator.\nAs an internal evaluator for 32 years I am somewhat confused.  Internal evaluators know that and expect that. Second, internal evaluators usually don\u2019t have a choice in deciding whether or not to participate it is part of their job. Third, for many internal evaluators the methods that are often employed usually duplicate the funding source approach. Why? Simply stated, program directors want to identify the problems before the county, city, state or federal governmental agency comes to the program so they can make an effort to resolve the problem.<|endoftext|>Well, I'm searching Killer Orbs in Suikoden V... but I don't find them. I know you can buy them in Port Spinacks... but they are so expensive that I decided to search anywhere else.\nI've read in many FAQS that you can get them in the Big Hole from the Killer Bunnies, but... I've been fighting there for hours and I haven't seen any bunnies. Where are they exactly? In that tunel where Levi is? In the ruins where Jeanne took me? In the World Map outside of the Big Hole? Or do I have to wait for the bunnies to appear (I'm right after the attack to Beaver Lodge)? What should I do?\nThe Big Hole caves itself, where Levi is. The ruins are a seperate area entirely. They (the Killer Bunnies) can also be found in the caves in Yashuna (when the water for the Tricolor Inn runs dry) as well as the Dwarf Mine caves, I think.\nBesides the bunnies, the only other enemy to drop Killer Orbs are a late game boss. You can also buy them at Port Spinacks when you can go there. I don't think it's too long after the attack on Beaver Lodge.\nHowever, if you decide to do that, be warned. \nI'd also like to add that you can actually meet the Killer Bunnies at the Twilight Ruins and at the World Map just outside the Twilight Ruins- just run around the general outside area between Port Spinacks and the ruins.\nI've realised that fighting single Killer Bunnies tends to have a higher drop rate for the Killer Orbs rather than fighting a group, but I could be wrong on that percentage.\nDon't forget to talk someone with a high treasure hunt ability.\nUrm? Who does have a high treasure hunt ability? and if this person is in the party would it be better?\nBabbage has an S in Treasure Hunt as soon as you recruit him. Bergen's can go up to SS but it takes time and training.\nLorelai and Zweig have it too. I think they can bring theirs up to B with training.\nI finally get the orbs. It seems that the bunnies appeared in the Big Hole when I completed the mision in Doraat, where you fight Alenia and recruit Miakis.\nDoes Treasure Hunt stack? I seem to remember reading that it does. If it does, being all of the Treasure Hunt characters with you (Zweig, Killey, Lorelai, Bergen, Babbage...who else?\nI'm not even sure myself if it stacks. Most people just bring them all just to be sure.\nFaylen and Faylon also have the Treasure Hunt skill.

        "passage": " A important reverse correlativity was so found between the degrees of IDO activity and 8-OHdG (r = -0.\n621, P = 0.0003) (Figure 3). When these analyses were performed individually for our pre-eclamptic and normotensive samples, a important correlativity was still observed (r = -0.\n712, P & A; lt; 0.001 in normotensive gestations and R = -0.591, P = 0.\n009 in preeclampsia, severally).\nThere is roll uping grounds that oxidative emphasis is involved in the oncoming of preeclampsia (Jauniaux et al. 2006; Perkins 2006; Myatt 2010). It is besides good known that dyslipidemia is a common happening in preeclampsia (Page 2002). Furthermore, inordinate lipid peroxidation due to free groups or reactive O contributes to vascular endothelium disfunction taking to the maternal symptoms of preeclampsia (Roberts and Hubel 1999). However, the tracts taking to the initiation of oxidative emphasis prior to the oncoming of pre-eclampsia remain ill-defined.\nOur current information suggest that increased oxidative emphasis in preeclampsia is likely to be the consequence of low placental IDO activity as 8-OHdG co-localizes with IDO, and the degrees of both molecules reciprocally correlate. When these analyses were performed individually for our preeclampsia and normotensive samples, important correlativities were still observed bespeaking that they are non merely due to a concurrency in this disease but are linked etiologically. Under normal physiological conditions during gestation, the placenta is protected from oxidative emphasis due to reactive O species generated by extended cell division and high metabolic activity (Burton et al. 2003; Jones et Al. 2010). Our present findings indicate that IDO plays a polar function in this antioxidant defence system in the placenta and that this is faulty in preeclampsia.We antecedently demonstrated that IDO activity is significantly reduced in pre-eclamptic placentas and that the IDO degrees reciprocally correlate with the badness of the symptoms of preeclampsia (Nishizawa et al.\n2007). In another old survey besides, IDO inhibitors produce a pre-eclampsia-like phenotype in pregnant mice transporting allogeneic embryos (Nishizawa et al. 2008). This suggested the possibility that reduced IDO degrees may be a primary cause of preeclampsia.\nHowever, we have antecedently performed sequence analysis of the IDO cistron in patients with pre-eclampsia and found no mutants or fluctuations that could be associated with this disease (Nishizawa et al. 2010). Although these familial analyses do non back up the hypothesis, our mouse theoretical account surveies have shown non merely increased blood force per unit area and albuminuria, but besides detected placental lesions that are typical for human preeclampsia, bespeaking that IDO degrees plays an indispensable function in the oncoming of this upset, either as a primary or secondary cause. Hence, the diverseness of maternal symptoms that appear in instances of terrible preeclampsia may be partially related to a faulty antioxidant system affecting a reduced IDO activity.\nOur current information should besides turn out to be a valuable resource for the designation of new curative tools for preeclampsia. In this respect, a clinical test of anti-oxidant addendums such as vitamin C and E has been performed to forestall the onset preeclampsia, although the consequences are still slightly controversial (Chappell et al. 1999; Poston et al.\n2006). Clinical tests of other anti-oxidants or the usage of IDO activators in carnal theoretical accounts of pre-eclampsia warrant farther probe.\nAll clinical samples were collected at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Fujita Health University, Japan. Placental biopsies were obtained from pre-eclamptic gestations (n = 18) and normotensive control gestations (n = 23).\nPreeclampsia was defined as a blood force per unit area of higher than 160/110 mmHg, with albuminuria of more than 2g in a 24 hr aggregation. Normotensive control topics were matched for maternal and gestational ages (Table 1). Pre-eclamptic adult females delivered neonates in the lower birth weight percentiles (Mann-Whitney U-test; P = 0.002). Informed consent was obtained from each patient and this survey was approved by the Ethical Review Board for Human Genome Studies at Fujita Health University (Accession Numberss 43 and 87; February 23, 2005).\nAll placental biopsies were obtained following Cesarean subdivision processs.\nTo avoid the effects of labour on the placental cistron look profile, merely specimens from adult females who had non undergone labour were included. A cardinal country of chorionic tissue was dissected, and the maternal deciduas and amniotic membranes were removed. We so dissected 1 centimeter thick subdivisions of placental villi from the cardinal country between the basal and chorionic home bases. After vigorous lavation of the maternal blood with saline, tissues were instantly frozen in liquid N and stored until usage.\nThe 8-OHdG degrees in placental tissue DNA were measured utilizing a extremely sensitive ELISA kit (JaICA, Fukuroi, Japan) in conformity with the maker \u2018s instructions.\nBriefly, genomic Deoxyribonucleic acid infusions from placental tissue were hydrolyzed with nuclease P1 (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan) for 1 hr, and so treated with alkalic phosphatase for a farther hr. After column purification, the bases were subjected to ELISA. Measurements of IDO activity were performed as antecedently reported (Nishizawa et al. 2007).\nPlacental tissues were besides homogenized and centrifuged and the resulting supernatants were assorted with a substrate solution incorporating L-tryptophan (Sigma, St Louis, MO), followed by incubation at 37 & A; deg; C for 60 min. The reaction was so stopped by incubation with 3 % perchloric acid at 50 & A; deg; C for 30 min. The supernatants were later assayed for enzymatic merchandises by HPLC (Eicom 300 series; Eicom, Kyoto, Japan).\nThe merchandises detected at 60 min were used as a step of the IDO activity values (nmol/h/mg protein).\nPlacental samples were fixed in 10 % formaldehyde overnight and so embedded in paraffin. Sections (2 millimeter) were collected onto silane-coated slides and dried in a conventional oven at 60 & A; deg; C for 24 h. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was so performed to enable histological scrutiny. For immunostaining, samples were deparaffinized and rehydrated and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 0.\n3 % H peroxide in methyl alcohol. For antigen retrieval, the slides were boiled in 1 millimeter EDTA (pH 8.0) in a force per unit area cooker for 10 min. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against 8-OHdG (N45.1; JaICA, Fukuroi, Japan) and against human IDO (1E7) were used (Takikawa et al. 1988). The signals were detected utilizing a peroxidase-based method with Simple Stain MAX-PO (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan), with 3,3-diaminobenzidine as a substrate.\nMouse IgG1 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) was used as the negative control. Counterstaining was performed with Mayer \u2018s hematoxylin solution.\nStatistical comparings between groups were performed utilizing the Student t trial and one-way analysis of discrepancy. Differences were considered to be important at P & A; lt; 0.\n05. Datas are reported as the mean \u00b1SD for each group. Correlations were evaluated utilizing consecutive line additive arrested development.\nFigure 1. Case-control survey of pre-eclamptic and normotensive gestations.\nA.

Bowman.<|endoftext|>How Can I Help? This is the question that many American Christians ask today. The emphasis is not on help but on I. In other words, what can \u201cI\u201d do about it? There are many issues, and when we really start thinking about all the things that need to be done, it can be overwhelming. In our world these issues are not small either, they are enormous it seems. There seems to be injustice everywhere. Injustice is when something is being done to a person they don\u2019t deserve, it is assault on innocence.\nI just got back from Africa and the issues there range from poverty, starvation, malnutrition to sex slavery and trade, abuse in every form, and corruption runs rampant through the continent. It is incredible however to see the Christian church alive and well there, and they are literally changing their world. You don\u2019t have to go to Cambodia to find these types of issues. America has its own problems with foster kids, and prison recidivism rates, as well as homelessness and a plethora of abuses.\nWe all know how overwhelming it can be. We are in good company however. Gideon said, \u201cwhat can I do?\u201d, Moses said, \u201cwhat can I do?\u201d Esther said, \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d The truth is we can\u2019t do everything, and we can\u2019t change the world over night, but we can do something. One thing we can\u2019t do, one thing we can never, ever be guilty of as the church, is doing nothing!\nWhat can we do? What did God say to Moses? He said, \u201cWhat do you have in your hand?\u201d Moses had the equipment of his occupation, his staff. God is not asking us to do what we can\u2019t He is asking us to do what we can. We have the equipment to do what He wants; we have the ability, skill, and talent. What we can do, is within our reach, it is no further than our next decision.\nWhat can we do? Take responsibility. Realize, the issues that surround us everyday, whether locally, regionally, nationally, or globally are not going away, we can not hide from it, we must stand up and move out. There is a scripture in psalms 119:68 \u201cyou are good, and you do good; teach me your statutes.\u201d David basically encapsulates the character of God in one simple statement, and then says, \u201cTeach me how to be like you.\u201d We\u2019ve done well as the church at the first part, being good. We learn about how to grow and develop as a Christian and How to be spiritual, or at least appear that way. We need to begin to practice the second part, doing good. What worked in Cambodia and what is working for us right here in the metro of OKC, is coupling the two characteristics of God. Being good, and doing good. It is living the mission of Christianity, by being Christ to the world. We are spreading the message of Jesus, and we are doing works of kindness like He did, and these two things brought together, will change our world. What can we do? Not everything and we can\u2019t change the world over night, but what the church must not ever be caught doing is nothing. Jesus did something and so can we. Lets tear down old thinking and limitations and then transform our minds, and actions to be that of Christ, and let the world know that in our churches the least of these are being effected and changed, because we are being and doing, what Jesus led us to do.\nI have started this blog several times and not been able to finish it. I guess because of the images i have seen, the people in such desperate need, your mind says, this can\u2019t be true, there was a moment that i was overwhelmed and my mind said this is too much, there is no way to fix this. However as I watched my friend Pat and the different leaders of the medical clinic and the feeding centers and the ministry to prostitutes it caused me to realize, what I have been saying is true. We can\u2019t do everything, but we can do something, and what we will never do is nothing!\n It seems to be ripe with resources but because of a lack of education on how to use the land, and a lack of money to resource education, and medical care and day to day living, this place for many is a nightmare.\nMy friend Jennifer wrote a while back, after she had visited this place, that it was one of the most difficult things she had ever seen or done. We literally have to choose the worst of the worst to help, because they are all in a bad way. You have to turn off your mind, which says, \u201cThere is too much need, what can we do?\u201d It says, \u201cI can\u2019t take this, I will put it out of my mind.\u201d We don\u2019t want to know that there are people living like this, starving, dying of malnutrition, dying of disease and sickness that would not kill them if they had proper medical care or could afford any kind of medical care.\nSo, I am shouting it from the housetops, don\u2019t turn your head, don\u2019t act as if it\u2019s not happening, do something, pray, give, go, do something. People like Pat and ICA need our help.\nIt\u2019s the same problem that we have in getting people to decide to help fight human trafficking. It\u2019s not that people don\u2019t care, it\u2019s not that people are unwilling, I truly believe that in our pristine world we just can\u2019t fathom that there are people who buy and sale humans for the purpose of perversion. We want to think that people who are being prostituted are choosing that life, and that somehow gets us off the hook from helping. When we find out that these are little girls 4, 5, 6 years old and up are being sold, or tricked, or kidnapped for the purpose of prostituting them for people who are so depraved that they would have sex with a child.\nIts ugly, we don\u2019t want to see it or know it. There is an indictment on the church, and that is we are condemning not caring. What if a person has chosen this life? What if they said I want to do this to make money, would we then say, you deserve what you get, or would we try to reach them with the love of Christ? What did He do with the woman at the well, the woman caught in the act of adultery, or Mary Magdalene, he didn\u2019t disqualify them from his love, they all made choices, but he loved them any way and helped them. Let\u2019s not consign people to the dark while we are holding the light, even when they are guilty by choice. I know that I was guilty by choice, and Jesus reached me, and I know that you were guilty by choice but he"

METHODS: A nationwide survey was performed for patients with ACLF occurring between 2017 and 2019. Cirrhotic patients with a Child-Pugh score of 5-9 were diagnosed as having ACLF when liver failure (serum bilirubin level of \u2265 5.0 mg/dL and a prothrombin time international normalization rate [INR] of \u2265 1.5) occurred within 28 days after an acute insult. Patients who fulfilled either criterion (total serum bilirubin or INR) and/or those with indeterminate Child-Pugh scores at baseline were also enrolled. RESULTS: Among the 501 enrolled patients, 183 patients (37%) were diagnosed as having ACLF. The etiologies of the cirrhosis and acute insults were alcohol intake/abuse in 114 (62%) and 75 (41%) patients, respectively. Sixty-eight patients (37%) were also diagnosed as having severe alcoholic hepatitis. The survival rate without liver transplantation was 48% among the ACLF patients and 71% in the remaining patients (P < 0.01). A multivariate analysis revealed that the disease condition was significantly associated with mortality, with an odds ratio of 2.025 in ACLF patients relative to the remaining patients (P < 0.01), and patient age and the number of organs with functional failure were also associated with mortality among the ACLF patients. CONCLUSION: The proposed diagnostic criteria for ACLF were useful for identifying cirrhotic patients with an unfavorable outcome following acute insults. A therapeutic strategy for patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis should be established, since such patients accounted for the majority of ACLF patients.\nEnvironmental factors, medical and family history, and comorbidities associated with primary biliary cholangitis in Japan: a multicenter case-control study.\nMatsumoto, Kosuke; Ohfuji, Satoko; Abe, Masanori; Komori, Atsumasa; Takahashi, Atsushi; Fujii, Hideki; Kawata, Kazuhito; Noritake, Hidenao; Tadokoro, Tomoko; Honda, Akira; Asami, Maiko; Namisaki, Tadashi; Ueno, Masayuki; Sato, Ken; Kakisaka, Keisuke; Arakawa, Mie; Ito, Takanori; Tanaka, Kazunari; Matsui, Takeshi; Setsu, Toru; Takamura, Masaaki; Yasuda, Satoshi; Katsumi, Tomohiro; Itakura, Jun; Sano, Tomoya; Tamura, Yamato; Miura, Ryo; Arizumi, Toshihiko; Asaoka, Yoshinari; Uno, Kiyoko; Nishitani, Ai; Ueno, Yoshiyuki; Terai, Shuji; Takikawa, Yasuhiro; Morimoto, Youichi; Yoshiji, Hitoshi; Mochida, Satoshi; Ikegami, Tadashi; Masaki, Tsutomu; Kawada, Norifumi; Ohira, Hiromasa; Tanaka, Atsushi.\nJ Gastroenterol ; 2021 Nov 18.\nBACKGROUND: Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is considered to be caused by the interaction between genetic background and environmental triggers. Previous case-control studies have indicated the associations of environmental factors (tobacco smoking, a history of urinary tract infection, and hair dye) use with PBC. Therefore, we conducted a multicenter case-control study to identify the environmental factors associated with the development of PBC in Japan. METHODS: From 21 participating centers in Japan, we prospectively enrolled 548 patients with PBC (male/female = 78/470, median age 66), and 548 age- and sex-matched controls. These participants completed a questionnaire comprising 121 items with respect to demographic, anthropometric, socioeconomic features, lifestyle, medical/familial history, and reproductive history in female individuals. The association was determined using conditional multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The identified factors were vault toilet at home in childhood [odds ratio (OR), 1.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-2.62], unpaved roads around the house in childhood (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.07-1.92), ever smoking (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.28-2.25), and hair dye use (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.15-2.14) in the model for lifestyle factors, and a history of any type of autoimmune disease (OR, 8.74; 95% CI, 3.99-19.13), a history of Cesarean section (OR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.077-0.53), and presence of PBC in first-degree relatives (OR, 21.1; 95% CI, 6.52-68.0) in the model for medical and familial factors. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that poor environmental hygiene in childhood (vault toilets and unpaved roads) and chronic exposure to chemicals (smoking and hair dye use) are likely to be risk factors for the development of PBC in Japan.\nUsefulness of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging in a Patient with Cardiac Involvement of Systemic Sclerosis.\nOta, Shingo; Taniguchi, Motoki; Katayama, Yosuke; Ozaki, Yuichi; Satogami, Keisuke; Ino, Yasushi; Yamamoto, Naoki; Onoda, Koji; Tanaka, Atsushi.\nIntern Med ; 2021 Nov 27.\nThrombotic events and rebleeding after hemorrhage in patients taking direct oral anticoagulants for non-valvular atrial fibrillation.\nYanagisawa, Daisuke; Abe, Koichiro; Amano, Hirohito; Komatsuda, Shogo; Honda, Taku; Manabe, Daisuke; Yamamoto, Hirosada; Kozuma, Ken; Kodashima, Shinya; Asaoka, Yoshinari; Yamamoto, Takatsugu; Tanaka, Atsushi.\nSeveral direct oral anticoagulants have been developed to prevent cardiogenic thrombosis in patients with atrial fibrillation, on the other hand, have the complication of bleeding. Since clinical course after bleeding with direct oral anticoagulant remains unclear, the present retrospective cohort study was to clarify the course after hemorrhage among patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants. Among all 2005 patients prescribed dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban between April 2011 and June 2017, subjects comprised 96 patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who experienced relevant bleeding during direct oral anticoagulant therapy (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 2 or above). The clinical course after hemorrhage was reviewed to examine whether rebleeding or thrombotic events occurred up to the end of December 2019. Gastrointestinal bleeding was the most frequent cause of initial bleeding (57 patients, 59%). Rebleeding occurred in 11 patients (4.5%/year), with gastrointestinal bleeding in 10 and subarachnoid hemorrhage in 1. All rebleeding occurred in patients who resumed anticoagulation therapy. Another significant factor related with rebleeding included past history of gastrointestinal bleeding. On the other hand, major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events occurred in 6 patients older than 75 years old or more (2.5%/year), with systemic thrombosis in 4 and cardiac death in 2. All 4 patients with systemic thrombosis withheld anticoagulants after index bleeding, although only 10 patients withheld anticoagulation therapy. Rebleeding should be taken care of when anticoagulants are resumed after bleeding, particularly among patients who initially experienced gastrointestinal bleeding. Systemic thrombosis occurred at a high rate when anticoagulant therapy was withheld after bleeding.\nImpact of cavotricuspid isthmus depth on the ablation index for successful first-pass typical atrial flutter ablation.\nKashiwagi, Manabu; Kuroi, Akio; Katayama, Yosuke; Terada, Kosei; Fujita, Suwako; Hozumi, Takeshi; Shimamura, Kunihiro; Shiono, Yasutsugu; Tanimoto, Takashi; Kubo, Takashi; Tanaka, Atsushi; Akasaka, Takashi.\nSci Rep ; 11(1): 22413, 2021 Nov 17.\nCavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) linear ablation has been established as the treatment for typical atrial flutter.

The Paris Agreement remains the world\u2019s best shot at avoiding runaway climate change. Implemented wisely, it can also unlock the inclusive growth story of the 21st century, improving lives around the world.\nThe economics of climate action have improved dramatically since then. Solar and wind power are now cheaper than coal and increasingly cheaper than natural gas. Electric vehicle technology has improved so quickly that some major automakers are planning to stop making internal combustion engines. Knowledge about how to sequester carbon in trees and soil, as well as industrially, is advancing rapidly. Climate solutions are cheaper and more available than ever before.\nAt the same time, the urgency of the climate crisis is even more stark today. More frequent and severe wildfires, storms, and record heatwaves are devastating communities. In the first half of 2019 such events displaced a record 7 million people. Climate change is disrupting lives and livelihoods, with the poorest hit hardest. New studies show that even half a degree of warming can lead to millions more people being impacted and much greater economic damage. Inaction, or inadequate action, will mean more lives lost, mass migration, major economic disruptions and worsening inequality.\nThe growing urgency of the climate crisis and the more favorable economics of climate action together show the dire need and the incredible opportunity for bold climate action. It is increasingly clear that low-carbon and resilient economic growth can be an engine to help revitalize global growth, contribute to poverty reduction, generate jobs and income opportunities, all while vigorously countering growing climate risks (see Box). And the public is waking up to the urgency and the opportunity of action: more than 7 million people in 185 countries took to the streets last September to demand that their governments step up climate action.\nBut there is resistance from vested interests in the old economy. That resistance is quick to latch on to the limitations of any climate policies that do not put people first.\nWhere there are genuine concerns by citizens, these can and must be addressed. Social unrest in France, Chile, Ecuador and elsewhere has shown that climate action is only politically viable if it delivers clear benefits to the vast majority of people now, and it cannot leave vulnerable communities or workers behind. To be politically viable, corrective measures must accompany any policies that may place a higher burden on low- and middle-income households.\nThe process of developing and implementing these policies is just as important. A transparent and deliberative process can help identify political and material risks, improve communication between decision-makers and the public, and give agency to socially and economically marginalized groups. Fortunately, there is ample evidence showing that policies that address climate change, developed through inclusive processes, can also deliver immediate benefits to people. We call this people-centered climate action.\nPeople-centered climate action does three things: through an inclusive process, it purposefully identifies and unlocks social and economic benefits, it targets these benefits to further equity, and it ensures a just and well-managed transition away from a high-carbon economy. Examples of people-centered climate action include using the revenues from carbon pricing or savings from cuts in fossil fuel subsidies to support low-income or vulnerable"

This can reboot the system and also you\u2019ll be booting from the USB.\nI favor the second technique as a result of you could have difficulties in with boot settings from the primary technique.\nBelow the Superior startup choice, click on on Restart now button.\nNow it\u2019ll energy off your system and reboot into the disk you selected which needs to be the reside USB disk.\nWhile you boot from the reside USB, you must see the GRUB display that presents you the choice to strive Ubuntu in reside USB or set up it immediately. It\u2019s possible you\u2019ll go along with both choice.\nIn the event you selected to strive reside USB, you must see the set up choice on the desktop display.\nClicking it\u2019ll begin the set up process that begins with selecting language and keyboard format.\nOn the subsequent display, it asks for the type of set up. Go along with Regular set up. No must obtain updates or set up third-party software program simply but. It\u2019s possible you\u2019ll do it after set up completes. In my expertise, it will increase the set up length and will create points at instances. I favor to keep away from it.\nIt takes a bit time and then you definately see the Set up kind display. This is likely one of the most essential components of the twin booting process.\nIn the event you see the \u2018Set up Ubuntu alongside Home windows Boot Supervisor\u2019, it\u2019s excellent news. You possibly can proceed with the remainder of the set up.\nHowever in case you are one of many unfortunate ones who don\u2019t see this feature, you\u2019ll must stop the set up and do some further efforts that I\u2019ve defined below the expandable part.\nWhat to do should you don\u2019t see \u2018Set up Ubuntu alongside Home windows\u2019 choice?\nRight here\u2019s what you have to be doing. Stop the set up. Energy off the reside Ubuntu session, take out the reside USB and activate the system once more.\nWhile you boot into Home windows, go to Disk Administration settings. Right here, shrink your C Drive (or D/E/F drives wherever you\u2019ve gotten loads of free area) and make some free area like 50, 100 GB or extra.\nAfter you have the free area, repeat the process from step 6. Which suggests boot from the USB and begin the set up process. While you see the Set up kind display once more, go along with One thing Else this time.\nIt\u2019ll take you to the partitioning display. Right here, you should utilize the free area you created earlier for putting in Ubuntu.\nIt\u2019s possible you\u2019ll select to allocate all the free area to root (swapfile and residential might be created robotically below root) or you possibly can separate root, swap and residential partitioning. Each strategies are effective.\nAs soon as the partition is in place, click on on Set up now and comply with the remainder of the tutorial.\nIssues are fairly simple from right here. You\u2019ll be requested to pick out a timezone.\nYou\u2019ll be requested to enter a username, hostname (pc\u2019s title) and a password. Fairly apparent, proper?\nNow it\u2019s simply the matter of ready. It ought to take 8-10 minutes to finish the set up.\nYou\u2019ll be requested to take away the USB disk. You possibly can take away the disk at this stage with out worrying. The system reboots after this.\nIf all the things went clean, you must see the grub display as soon as the system powers on. Right here, you possibly can select Ubuntu in addition into Ubuntu and Home windows boot supervisor in addition into Home windows. Fairly cool, proper?\nIn the event you don\u2019t see the choice to put in Ubuntu alongside Home windows, stop the set up, flip off the system and boot into Home windows. Right here, make some free area in your disk by shrinking your disk measurement.\nWhat are your choice should you don\u2019t see the grub display?\nIn some unlucky instances, chances are you\u2019ll not see the grub display. There are a couple of prospects right here.\nIf it boots straight into Home windows, go to UEFI boot settings and see if there may be an choice for Ubuntu together with Home windows. If sure, attempt to transfer Ubuntu up within the boot order.\nIn the event you see grub rescue display, chances are you\u2019ll attempt to repair the boot challenge by booting into reside Ubuntu USB and use the boot restore instrument.\nIn case you are not in a position to repair the grub error and getting panic assault, settle down. You possibly can revert to Home windows. Go into UEFI boot settings and use Home windows boot supervisor in addition into Home windows. Right here, delete the Ubuntu partition to say the disk area and from the UEFI boot settings, delete the Ubuntu/grub boot file.\nIn case you are not in a position to boot into Home windows in any respect (extraordinarily uncommon case), it\u2019s time to make the most of the Home windows restoration disk and the backup you had made earlier.\nWhile you boot into Ubuntu, you must see this welcome display.\nYou\u2019re at penultimate stage. The one remaining half is to re-enable BitLocker to your Home windows partitioning, in order for you encryption once more. It\u2019s possible you\u2019ll depart it unencrypted as effectively. It\u2019s actually as much as you.\nRestart your system and choose Home windows boot supervisor on the grub display in addition into Home windows. In Home windows, go to BitLocker settings and click on on \u2018Activate BitLocker\u2019 choice.\nRight here\u2019s an essential factor. Every time you disable and re-enable BitLocker the restoration key modifications. Because of this you\u2019ll be requested to again up your restoration key as soon as once more. Put it aside to your account as soon as once more.\nOn the subsequent step, it asks if you wish to encrypt all the disk or solely the used area. You possibly can select both choice relying in your want.\nBegin the encryption. Please needless to say encrypting the disk will take a while (primarily based in your used disk area) and consumes appreciable processing energy. Have persistence.\nIssues look all set. Earlier than ending the tutorial, I\u2019ll additionally present you what to do when Home windows asks for the BitLocker restoration key.\nWhile you re-enable BitLocker, it may sense that the boot settings has been modified. For that cause, it\u2019ll ask for the restoration key while you attempt to boot into Home windows after re-enabling BitLocker.\nIt mentions the restoration key ID. The primary eight characters are essential to determine the proper restoration key.\nOn a cell gadget or on one other pc or boot into Ubuntu after which entry your Microsoft account and take a look at the saved restoration keys.\nYou\u2019ll have multiple restoration keys on the account of saving the important thing a number of instances. That is the place the restoration key ID turns out to be useful. Take a be aware of the 40 digit restoration key related to that restoration key ID.\nEnter this restoration key to unlock BitLocker and entry Home windows.\nDon\u2019t fear. It gained\u2019t ask you for the restoration key each time you boot into Home windows. It\u2019s simply while you make a change within the boot settings.\nHave been you in a position to efficiently twin boot Home windows 10 with Ubuntu and BitLocker?\nI do know it was lengthy learn with too many steps and pictures. I truly tried to present you all the mandatory particulars so that you just don\u2019t really feel uncomfortable or misplaced at any stage.

But during that time period where you either have a shitty job or are still pursuing a higher education, how do you live? Do you live with your parents? Do you rent an apartment in a low cost of living area?\n\nIt widely depends on what happens this year to be honest.\n\n2 months ago I would have told you that you would be graduating very likely into a fantastic economy with very low unemployment and you shouldn't worry too much, but it seems likely that there's going to be significant ongoing impact from the coronavirus.\n\nOn the other hand five years is a very long time.\n\nHere's my general advice to anyone who's looking to go off to college.\n\nFirst seriously consider doing your first couple of years at community college and transfer your credits.  Even Barack Obama did this and it worked out just fine for him.  He did three years at the far less expensive Occidental University in California, transferred to Columbia, and his sheepskin says Colombia, and he's a Columbia graduate.\n\nSecond, while I wish that this was 15 or 20 years ago, and I could tell you to go off and get the full college experience and find yourself, that is no longer the case.  College is now the bare minimum for entry into most middle-class jobs. \n\nYour goal over the next year should be to spectacularly achieve academically and apply for every scholarship you can find out about.  You should strongly consider in-state colleges, and do everything possible to reduce your debt burden.  \n\nThird, free college like it's a job. if you want to go out and have fun do it on Saturday night, the rest of the time you're up and ready to go by 8, in bed by 11.\n\nUtilize all the resources available to you, you will never again have access to this many books or this many phds with office hours.  And all those phds know people in their field and can be extremely helpful in getting you jobs later on.\n\nI went to college 15 years ago, my understanding is not that has become spectacularly more difficult since.  if you don't think you can be a straight A student in college, you should seriously consider a different path.  \n\nIt's no longer merely enough to go to college and do okay.  you need to go to college and achieve spectacularly if you want to come out without floundering all over the place like most of your peers will.<|endoftext|>The Henna Jade Bookshelf is a grand piece crafted in solid elm and stainless steel.

She was People Power before many young folks appreciated the struggle \u2013 and before our dark-suited brothers boxed Bobi Wine into reducing his influence to just a political party. [Save me of the justification, please]. Perhaps the only Ugandan activist who is both eloquent online, and active in the streets, Nyanzi has directly suffered the wrath of Museveni shamelessness.\nA state-persecuted scholar, and political prisoner, her NUP-identifying boyfriend was drone-kidnapped a few days after the election before Nyanzi fled into exile; and her three beautiful children were being trailed, and had to constantly move schools because of their mother\u2019s public profile.\nNyanzi is (or was?) personal friends with BW before many found reason to entrust him with their dreams. My point is, there are a thousand reasons for folks to be humble when Nyanzi voices her bitterness with Bobi Wine. She is the struggle itself. It will be a painful but sobering realization for many of his fans \u2013 in their millions \u2013 that while Bobi Wine was charismatic and inspiring [a job he has done exceptionally well], he was no revolutionary.\nUnderstanding that the Promised Land \u2013 uprooting a 34-year-old autocrat \u2013 was too ambitious, or that Bobi Wine lacked the mettle and strategy to deliver on his promise, even when the opportunity presented itself, will hurt deeply. As a student of popular culture and politics, I hold Bobi Wine in high regard especially as an organic intellectual.\nHe is the physical manifestation of the guy Okot p\u2019 Bitek theorized in Artist, the Ruler. Bobi Wine has given his compatriots discourse \u2013 funa endagamuntu, twebereremu, \u201cpeople power is stronger than the people in power\u201d \u2013 and enabled them to become active political subjects.\nTo the mass of young activists and politicians, Bobi Wine is their hero, and our mendacious chroniclers ought to be generous in memorializing his name. But as a man charged with revolutionary responsibilities, Bobi Wine might have lacked the sinews for the challenge.\nI use the term \u2018revolution\u2019 and \u2018revolutionary\u2019 in a very strict sense; that is, being able to overthrow Uganda\u2019s excessively molested constitution \u2013 from which Museveni derives legitimacy \u2013 and setting in motion a series of political crises. By overthrowing the constitution, Museveni and team would collapse with it before escaping Uganda via the Malaba border into Kenya.\nIf you ask any ordinary folks on the streets of Kampala, this was their dream impress of the new kid on the block, Robert Kyagulanyi. [Not toreplace Kizza Besigye, and take FDC\u2019s place. This would be to ascribe small and inconsequential dreams to the wananchi who embraced BW]. Before and in the course of the election season, several revolutionary moments emerged \u2013 all in favour and around Bobi Wine.\nWe will never know whether Bobi Wine and team actually saw them, or were too cowardly to grab them. Yet, revolutionary moments tend to be fleeting and cursory. They appear and disappear only after a short time. They are supposed to be seized at the earliest opportunity. Let\u2019s examine three major moments lost.\nClosely appreciated, the events of 18 and 19, November 2020 were meant to set us on a course for revolution. As the news of Kyagulanyi\u2019s arrest circulated, ordinary folks, fully conscientized and self-mobilized, took to the streets demanding his release. Museveni and his shameless vigilantes went on a shooting spree, and murdered indiscriminately.\nThe world was appalled. Anger was everywhere. Interestingly, while Museveni congratulated himself for having sent a strong threatening signal to NUP revolutionary mindset, he had actually created a sumptuous revolutionary moment. Bobi Wine had to grab it by both hands and throw it back.\nHe did not have to return to the campaign trail. He had to demand the release of all persons arrested, demand for accountability of all guns seen on the streets, and demand that all victims are compensated.\nThis moment had to be escalated. He had to issue clear public statements to this effect, including stating that no one is buried before investigations are complete. Sadly, he didn\u2019t grab the opportunity and simply returned to the campaign trail like no major event had happened.\nIndeed, Museveni was even energized to brag about it and even abuse his campaign more. He not only often"

Intended for the Kawasaki Ki-91 Long-Range Heavy Bomber project, the latter was itself a development of the Ha-140 that also powered the twin-engine Type 4 Hiry\u016b Heavy Bomber (Ki-67, Peggy), one of the no less than 28 Mitsubishi-designed aircraft that completed their maiden flights from Kakamigahara.\nOther Hien-related exhibits include a replica Hien Model 1b instrument panel (above); panels for a Zero Model 52a and a Ki-43-1 Hayabusa are also on display.\nA nearby showcase houses a 200-litre (53 U.S. gallon) Model 2 wooden drop tank that is tied in with a video of a wartime propaganda film showing drop tank production in a factory at the then Takayama High School for Girls, Gifu Prefecture, in 1944.\nPlaced against the far wall is a showcase of more Doi memorabilia (above), including some of the tools of his trade and a Kawasaki KDA-5 (Army Type 92 Fighter) manual, with a replica general arrangement drawing of the Ki-91 mounted on the wall behind. There is even a German book on aerodynamics that is labelled as having belonged to Doi during his student days.\nA display case of typical clothing worn by pilots and maintenance crew members from the mid-1930s is flanked, on one side, by another containing items such as an Army Type 1 Parachute from 1944 and, on the other, by a draughtsman\u2019s table, complete with implements, and a propeller blade from a Ki-102 (Randy).\nSuspended from the ceiling here is another full-scale replica, this time of a Grade II Libelle monoplane, the type that Army Capt.

Although some are well-known, the aircraft types are not given in English, so they are listed in three parts below.

Here the theme is Postwar Aircraft Development.\nLined up along the left wall as you enter and listed from the front to the back of the hall, are the following aircraft.\nThe KAT-1 was the then Kawasaki Aircraft Co., Ltd.\u2019s attempt to have one of its designs adopted as the primary training aircraft for the National Safety Agency (today\u2019s Ministry of Defense) in 1954. Having lost out to the T-34A Mentor, JA3084 was used as a training aircraft at a Ministry of Transport flight academy in Miyazaki Prefecture from February 1954 to October 1962. That same month, the aircraft was transported to the opposite end of the country and placed on display at a children\u2019s science education facility in Takikawa, Hokkaido. There the aircraft remained until transferred home to Kakamigahara in 2002 and made ready for display after an absence of some 49 years.\nDelivered to the JASDF in November 1956, this Kawasaki-assembled aircraft provided 27 years of active test flight service at Gifu AB, from 1967 to 1994. Having been officially struck off charge in March 1997, on July 14, 1998, the now long-term Kakamigahara resident was ignominiously \u2018flown\u2019 the short distance to the museum dangling from a Kawasaki Helicopter System KV-107 and placed on display the following day.\nThe T-1 was the first indigenously produced jet aircraft to see operational service in Japan. Although the museum has held the prototype T-1 in store since late April 2002, the 10th aircraft was chosen for display due to its long association with Gifu AB, which started when the aircraft was still a factory-fresh T1F2 in 1960 and ended with its final flight on March 2, 2006. Retaining the markings applied to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Air Proving Wing (APW, now the Air Development & Test Wing) in 2005, the aircraft was\u2014unlike the T-33A\u2014towed intact to its new home. A YouTube video exists (link) of the aircraft being moved out again prior to the start of renovation work in October 2016.\nInitially delivered to the 201st Sqn in February 1963, this aircraft also flew with the 83rd Air Wing at Naha before its final, year-long active assignment with the APW at Gifu, from 1985 to April 1986.\nStill bearing the markings from its time with the Blue Impulse aerobatic team, this aircraft\u2019s active service career began in 1981 and ended in 1995.\nFirst delivered on July 6, 1972, the third prototype T-2 trainer was naturally initially assigned to the type\u2019s test programme from Gifu AB and then, from April 6, 1982, to the JASDF Air Proving Wing (APW). Converted to investigate flight stability achieved by computer control, the data from which would later be utilized in the development of the Mitsubishi F-2, the single-seat T-2 CCV was first flown from Nagoya on August 9, 1983, and again, this time with a fly-by-wire system installed and its distinctive canard wings fitted, on February 16, 1984.\nAt the end of the two-year joint TRDI*-APW programme, during which 137 flights were completed, the aircraft was utilized for additional research and test pilot training at Gifu, where it remained in store for airing on base open days following its withdrawal from use on October 31, 2002. Reportedly a target for the museum from the start, arranging the loan of an aircraft that is certified for preservation by the JASDF took time and patience on the part of the Kakagamihara City authorities, but those efforts were eventually rewarded.\nCurrently positioned behind the T-2 CCV, the Asuka experimental aircraft dominates the rear of the hall. Developed as a national project by the then Science and Technology Agency\u2019s National Aerospace Laboratory (NAL, now the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency), the aircraft was designed to investigate short takeoff and landing technologies, in combination with the utilization of a computer-controlled flight system, and ways to reduce aircraft noise footprints. Unlike the other test aircraft in the collection, Asuka was from the outset modelled on rather than a conversion of an existing airframe, in this case a Kawasaki C-1. The two-kanji name Asuka (\u98db\u9ce5), literally means \u2018flying bird\u2019 or \u2018bird on the wing\u2019; more obscurely, it was also the name of the Imperial capital during the Asuka period (538\u2013710) in Japanese history.\nThe above photo shows the configuration of the four entirely new, Japan-produced FJR710 turbofan engines that were mounted ahead of and above the main wing. The STOL performance tests centered on lift generation by means of upper surface blowing (USB), by which the jet efflux from the engines was passed over the top of the blast-protected main wing through double rows of vortex generators and redirected downwards over the flaps. This configuration had already been adopted on twin-engine designs in the mid-1970s, most notably the two Boeing YC-14 tactical transport"

Simply right-click the highest parent folder and choose to synchronize. Lightroom will sync all the existing folders within that folder.\nThe goal of managing your photo library is to delete the bad photos and highlight your good ones, and you can start by using nags. Whenever you see a photo you like, press P to mark the photo as a pick, to mark the photo as a reject, hit the key X. A little message appears each time to tell you what you\u2019ve marked, and a little flag icon appears on the bottom left of that photo to indicate That it\u2019s been flagged \u2013 a white flag denotes a pick, a black flag denotes a reject. If you make a mistake, simply press u to un-flag it.\nThe great thing about using flags is that you can always view your picks easily by using the Attribute filter in the Library\u2019s central panel. Simply click on the white flag and all the photos you\u2019ve flagged as picks will appear.

Get the lowdown on next week's Walford drama.\nJanine (Charlie Brooks) has been trying to patch things up with her daughter Scarlett as she is being investigated by social services.\nHowever, the nine-year-old played by Tabitha Byron has been less than eager to have a relationship with her mother.\nUnbeknownst to her, Janine gets help from Mick (Danny Dyer) as he tells her she needs to prove she is a good mother.\nFollowing another one of Scarlett's rejections, Mick takes matters into his own hands to help the pair kiss and make up.\nMick gives Scarlett a special present, pretending it was all Janine's idea.\nBut while the gesture was certainly made out of kindness, Mick is unaware that stone-cold Janine is slowly but surely warming up to him.\nTwelve-year-old Bailey (Kara-Leah Fernandes) hatches a plan to push Karen (Lorraine Stanley) and Mitch (Roger Griffiths) back into each other's arms when she hears them argue over their sleeping situation.\nAnd while Karen complains to the young girl about a leak in the roof (which has led to the former couple sharing the same bed), Mitch gets a surprise delivery.\nWhen Karen receives her own parcel, Bailey is delighted to see everything is going according to her plan.\nShe even believes she can get away with it when she sees that Karen is none the wiser.\nHowever, Bailey's half-brother Keegan (Zack Morris) and Mitch soon clock on.\nA sympathetic Mitch has a chat with his daughter and tells he can't make him and Karen fall in love again.\n\nSoon after, Bailey and Mitch overhear her talk about the driver but get their hopes when they believe she is talking about her former partner.\nWill they realise their mistake?\nAfter his son Aaron's arrest, Harvey (Ross Boatman) decides to give himself and Dana (Barbara Smith) a fresh start by moving out of Albert Square.\nHe explains to Jack Branning (played by Scott Maslen) that he and his daughter need to leave and lies about his mother being ill.\n\nAccording to him, Jack could kick them out if he finds out about their link with Aaron.\nBut while Harvey is set to pack up and leave, Dana doesn't want to tag along.\nIs she hopeful to rekindle things with Bobby?\n\nBelieving she hung up on the phone, she subsequently reveals a huge secret while talking to Mila and Kioni\u2026 with Peter listening in.\nFaced with the possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison, it's no wonder why Phil (Steve McFadden) is so stressed.\nThe villain loses his cool when Kat (Jessie Wallace) puts his phone on silent so they can have some alone time.\nWhen he sees that he has missed multiple calls, Phil blames Kat and lashes out at her, only to apologise several moments later.\nKnowing he could never accept being an informant for the police, and to spare Kat from heartbreak, Phil makes a tough decision.\nAfter apologising to her for his behaviour, he puts an end to their relationship.\nKat is understandably distraught by this abrupt breakup.\nBut when Sharon (Letitia Dean) learns that Phil ended things with her, she knows the Walford baddie is hiding something.\nLying the pressure on him, Sharon eventually gets him to admit that he hasn't said anything to Kat about his potential life sentence.\nShe gives him a chance to come clean, adding that if he decided not to, she would be telling Kat everything herself.\nWhat will Phil do?\nRainie (Tanya Franks) and Stuart (Ricky Champ) for a united front against the latter's cancer.\nAnd after initially pushing her away from her upon finding out he was ill, Stuart lets Rainie in, letting her assist him during every step of his battle.\nDuring an emergency appointment scheduled by Rainie, the doctor explains the surgery Stuart will be undergoing and makes it clear that the operation should be planned as soon as possible.\nBut when the doctor mentions pain medication, Stuart immediately panics and tells Mick he feels he is being punished for his past.\nWhat is Stuart hiding?\nGray's (Toby-Alexander Smith) grasp on Chelsea is getting tighter.\nAlthough she was prescribed anti-depressants by her GP, Chelsea (Zaraah Abrahams) refuses to take the medication in order to breast feed her son Jordan.\nKheerat (Jaz Deol) gives her the chance to unwind at the salon, knowing she has been feeling defeated, while he distracts Gray by giving a lift to the hospital.\nBut when Chelsea relaxes with a sip of champagne, she gets an urgent call from Gray: Jordan has stopped breathing.\nWhile with Gray, Kheerat tries to get him to confess to Chantelle's murder but is interrupted by a doctor who urges the young father to make a decision.\nThe doctor announces that they can give Jordan a tracheotomy.\nGray agrees but becomes livid when Chelsea meets up with him and Keerat and he smells alcohol on her.\nWhen Kheerat steps in, adding that he paid for Chelsea's session, Gray is fuming and accuses him of being obsessed with his wives.\nLater on, Whitney (Shona McGarty) tries to talk to Chelsea but the latter is firmly under Gray's thumb.\nChelsea tells Whitney she no longer wants anything to do with her or Kheerat, putting an end to their plan to expose Gray.\nHas Chelsea really given up?<|endoftext|>Filming has officially begun on Jun Ji Hyun and Lee Min Ho\u2019s comeback drama!\nThe two Hallyu stars are playing the leads in SBS\u2019s \u201cLegend of the Blue

HONDA tumors were treated with intraneoplastic inoculations of 2 \u00d7 105 pfu of G47\u0394 on days 0 and 3 in combination with 60-day-long flutamide pellets implanted on day 0. The combination treatment (\u25b3) was significantly more efficacious than flutamide alone (\u25ca) or G47\u0394 alone (\u2022). P < 0.05 for G47\u0394 alone on days 15 to 30 and for flutamide alone on days 23 and 30 to 34. Bars, SE. B, Kaplan-Meier analyses of survival in experiments described above.\nAthymic male mice bearing established s.c. HONDA tumors (5 mm in diameter) were also treated with intraneoplastic G47\u0394 inoculations [2 \u00d7 105 pfu, days 0 and 3; intermediate growth inhibition from Fig. 2 (right)] in combination with 60-day-release flutamide (50 mg/kg/d) or placebo pellets (from day 0). The combination therapy again caused an enhanced inhibition of tumor growth, resulting in significantly smaller tumor volumes than flutamide alone (P < 0.05 on days 15-30) or G47\u0394 alone (P < 0.05 on days 23 and 30-34; Fig. 4A, right). At the G47\u0394 doses tested, Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that the combination therapy significantly prolonged survival of tumor-bearing animals in both models compared with monotherapies of androgen ablation and G47\u0394 treatment (P < 0.05; Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained with G207 in combination with flutamide (Supplementary Fig. S2).\nAndrogen ablation, either through surgical castration or administration of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs, forms the basis of the most common strategies for the management of locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer (17). However, despite a favorable initial response in 70% to 80% of these patients, androgen ablation results in only 2% to 3% improvement of 5-year survival, and most patients eventually experience biochemical or clinical evidence of disease progression within a median time of 12 to 18 months (18).  Previously, we reported that LNCaP tumors that recurred after radiation therapy remained sensitive to G207 therapy (4). Herein, we show that G47\u0394 treatment was efficacious for relapsed HONDA tumors that became refractory to androgen ablation. Thus, intraneoplastic administration of oncolytic HSV-1 vectors may be a useful second-line treatment modality for localized prostate cancer deposits that have progressed after either radiation therapy or androgen ablation.\nImportantly, oncolytic virus therapy may also be considered in earlier-stage prostate cancer at the time that androgen ablation therapy is initiated. Our studies show that oncolytic HSV-1 therapy improves the outcome when combined with androgen ablation therapy. The combination of castration with G47\u0394 treatment resulted in tumor growth suppression that was significantly greater than either castration or G47\u0394 treatment alone in the mouse TRAMP-C2 s.c. model. Similarly, the combination treatment of flutamide with G47\u0394 resulted in significantly better tumor growth inhibition than either flutamide or G47\u0394 alone in the human HONDA s.c. model. Thus, both in mouse syngeneic and in human xenograft models of prostate cancer, the combination of androgen ablation with G47\u0394 results in superior tumor growth suppression and prolonged animal survival compared with either therapy alone. This enhanced inhibition of tumor growth was observed to be specific not only to G47\u0394 but also to G207.\nWhereas our studies were done using intraneoplastic inoculation of viral vector and whereas such inoculations may benefit locally advanced disease, studies in other settings have shown that i.v. delivery of HSV-1 vectors is feasible and can cause regression of distant prostate cancer deposits (4). This would be a clinically relevant area for future investigation for treatment of widely metastatic prostate cancer with G47\u0394 in combination with androgen ablation. Whereas the syngeneic TRAMP-C2 model used in the study is relatively resistant to HSV-1 pathogenicity among murine models, the improved efficacy of G47\u0394 may reflect into a greater clinical effect in which human prostate cancer cells are more susceptible to HSV-1.\nRecently, replication-competent adenovirus vectors have been tested for recurrent or high-risk prostate cancer in multiple clinical studies (20, 21). The results showed that intraprostatic delivery of oncolytic viruses was safe and could cause a reduction in the serum prostate-specific antigen levels, warranting a further development of this therapeutic approach.\nIn summary, the data presented suggest that oncolytic virus therapy using G47\u0394 in combination with androgen ablation is worthy of further exploration and development for the treatment of primary or recurrent prostate cancer.\nWe thank Dr. Susan Varghese for technical support, Dr. Fuminori Sato for useful advice on immunostaining for prostate-specific antigen, and Miyuki Hikasa and Usha Macgarvey for their technical assistance.\nGrant support: U.S. Department of Defense grant W81XWH-04-1-0254 (R.L.

After leaving Jiangsu Province, I had an opportunity to visit the equivalent of another Tier 3 city, this time in neighboring Zhejiang.\nWith a population of approximately 400,000, Yuhuan County is about one-half the size of Yizheng and has yet to be granted city status. However, it is no less prosperous. Yuhuan\u2019s gross domestic product, according to the people I visited, is approximately RMB 100 billion ($15.4 billion). If that\u2019s true, and I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of their numbers, then per capita income at RMB 250,000 ($38,000) has to be one of the highest in the country. That\u2019s the reason why average apartment prices are RMB 15,000 ($2,308) per square meter.\nRinged by mountains and surrounded by water, Yuhuan County is literally an island and is cut off from the rest of China. After flying into Wenzhou from Shanghai, we had to take a ferry during one part of our hour and a half car journey.\nYuhuan is part of the prefecture of Taizhou, and symbolizes the entrepreneurial spirit that has come to characterize all of Zhejiang province, itself considered one of the most entrepreneurial provinces in the country. Yuhuan is known for its production of valves, automobile parts and furniture. When I was at ASIMCO and we gave quotes to potential export customers, often they would tell us that our quotes were much higher than others they had received in China. More often than not, they had gotten their lower quotes from companies in Zhejiang province.\nNow I understand why. Companies in cities and counties like Yuhuan are very innovative and entrepreneurial. When asked how Yuhuan had gotten into the automotive parts business, the answer was that Yuhuan\u2019s physical isolation from the rest of China meant that the local citizenry had to become self-sufficient and learn how to repair the motors for the city\u2019s many fishing boats. Makes sense to me.\nOne of the companies I visited was Kailing, a manufacturer of brake systems for high end bicycles, motorcycles and passenger cars. Kailing not only makes all of its own components, it has also designed entire brake assemblies that it sells to original equipment manufacturers in China, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain and India. Approximately 40 percent of Kailing\u2019s RMB 150 million ($23 million) of sales is exported. The company is now beginning to manufacture brake systems for wind turbines because it sees a big opportunity due to the emphasis on alternative energy by the central government and the fact that all of these products are now imported.\nWhen asked how Kailing combats rising labor costs in China, the chairman explained that labor is only one cost involved in making a product. Kailing focuses on total cost, which includes engineering overhead and other expenses. That, and the company\u2019s emphasis on quality, is how Kailing maintains its competitive edge and can export its products to other low-cost countries like India.\nApproximately one-half of Yuhuan\u2019s GDP comes from the 2300 automotive components companies that are registered in the county. Yet, very few of the components companies are foreign-invested, and there are no vehicle assemblers in the county. The entrepreneurs of Yuhuan have developed their products and technologies completely on their own, and without a visible customer in site.\nWith average sales of RMB 21.7 million ($3.3 million) per company, and fewer than 50 companies with sales greater than RMB 150 million ($23.0 million), Yuhuan demonstrates once again just how fragmented China\u2019s industries are. The county itself also demonstrates that prosperity is not only found in China\u2019s Tier 1 cities.<|endoftext|>Takikawa Oblate, manufacturer and wholesaler of medical oblate and edible oblate products, boasts over 80% of the oblate, or wafer sheet, market share in Japan.

After all she is taking the blame on herself\u2019, said the police officer to the criminal in front of me.\nSo where were we? Yes, the doors opened and people began to flood in. I tried to push and nudge my way out but no luck. With a huge sigh I decided to get off at the next station \u2013 New Delhi. As I positioned myself close to the exit door I felt a sense of unease run through my body, like someone has pierced their gaze on me or someone is watching me. Suddenly I felt something touch me from behind. With half my mind on trying to get off at the next station I turned thinking it was someone\u2019s bag or hand touching me repeatedly. I turned to see a man in a white kurta (long shirt) staring right at me and he had no baggage with him. In fact both his hands were clenching the railing next to him. But if both his hands were up there what was it that\u2026 I got my answer as soon as I lowered my sight. There beneath that long shirt I could clearly see that this man was UNZIPPED. I felt the blood rush to my head, boiling and fuming and fury ran through every nerve in my body.\nAs we took him to the control room he told the police that I am mistaken, it was his hand that touched me by mistake and it could happen to anyone because it was a crowded train. \u201cAsk her\u2026 it was my hand\u201d, he said. 15 guards, all men turned towards me as he tried to shame me. But if he had the guts to do it I had the spine to say it. You see anger brings out the strength you never thought you had in you but in my case anger brought out a language I never thought I could use.\nI was outright and I had all the right to be \u2013 \u201cLift up that kurta and you will know exactly what touched me\u201d. There. I said it out loud and clear. The guards felt outraged and charged at him. Within seconds he begged for an apology and suddenly the hand in question transformed into a part of his body he wished he never had. \u201cWhy would this girl lie? After all she is taking the blame on herself\u201d, said the police officer to the criminal in front of me. He committed the crime, I raised my voice and yet somehow the shame was on me. That statement reflected the thought process of our society, in fact it said much more. I argued with the officer and told the man in question that I have lost NOTHING in this entire episode and in fact I will make him pay for this. He immediately begged for an apology and I instead, insisted to file an FIR. After a few calls, 5 friends of mine reached the station to back me up and how? They were equally angered and showed no mercy.\nYou see there are several measures being taken to make our public spots and transport safe. Someone asked me as to why I did not take the women\u2019s only coach? But honestly that\u2019s not a solution. These reservations in fact paint the idea that it is not ok or safe for women to be in public spaces. It\u2019s debatable, I know but are reservations really improving the situation? Then what would?\nI could just bite the bullet and accept that I was eve teased or molested. Or I can raise my voice and instill the fear in the criminal instead of victimizing myself.  Her silence was his encouragement. Remember every time you choose to ignore or walk away, you put someone else in danger.\nThe Logical Indian salutes the courage of Megha for fighting back and giving a lifetime lesson to other girls of Delhi and India.\nSpeak up girls, fight back!\nIf you don\u2019t, you are feeding a devil!\n#Share This Inspiring Story!<|endoftext|>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has blamed all governments and political parties for creating hurdles in the organisation of the local government (LG) polls, ARY News reported on Monday.\nECP sources told ARY News that all governments and political parties created"

The famous \u201cChief Seattle\u201d speech that contains the lines above was made up for a Southern Baptist film project about pollution in 1971 (thanks to Russell Moore for the trivia tip). The writer, a professor of film named Ted Perry, was under contract to do the script, and he imagined what Chief Seattle might have to say about the environmental problems of the day. The words are moving\u2013so moving that people soon forgot they were invented, and they took on a life of their own.\nConservation writer and activist Andy Kerr has what looks like a fairly complete history of the origins of the speech Chief Seattle never actually made. Snopes.com has a standard copy of the Chief Seattle address.\nAccording to another account of the speech\u2019s origins, Perry\u2019s version was edited to make it more Christian. The version most folks see does contain a fair amount of religious language. It\u2019s more feel-good, pop theology than anything derived from Christian (or Jewish) scriptures (this was done in an era before theological conservatives began to ramp up the quality of Southern Baptist theological reflection). But you see the language cropping up often in environmental writing, and even in scholarly work. Al Gore apparently quoted the fake speech in his book Earth in the Balance. You can even find a Chief Seattle quote on the website of the Environmental Protection Agency.\nSo which is more shocking\u2013(1) that so many people love and adore a fake speech, (2) that in the 1970s Southern Baptists were producing films about pollution, or (3) that environmentalists so often quote a Southern Baptist document?\nYou can see an example of current Southern Baptist engagement with environmental theology by watching pastor and former SBC president James Merritt preach on the \u201cTheology of Ecology\u201d. Merritt would never have countenanced the dodgy theology of the Chief Seattle speech. He puts Christian environmental thought on a stronger Scriptural footing.\nThe real Chief Seattle was actually a Catholic, and he did give a speech, but the records are very poor on what he said. The much-published 1971 version has been revealed to be fake repeatedly, starting back in the 1990s, in publications such as Omni, Newsweek, and the New York Times (which published a front-page article on the myth of the Chief Seattle speech).<|endoftext|>Detects human PLG, human Plasmin, and the catalytic domain in direct ELISAs and Western blots.\nMeasured by its ability to neutralize Human Plasminogen (1 \u00b5g/mL, Catalog # 1939-SE) cleavage of the fluorogenic peptide substrate Suc-AFK-Amc (100 \u00b5M).

Synthesized in the kidney, PLG is found in plasma and many extracellular fluids. Activated by u- or t-plasminogen activator, the single-chain PLG (amino acid residues 20-810) is converted to plasmin, which consists of disulfide bond-linked heavy chain A (residues 20-580) and light chain B (residues 581-810). Heavy chain A contains 5 kringle domains and light chain B corresponds to the serine protease domain. A fragment consisting of the first 4 kringle domains has been named as angiostatin, a novel angiogenesis inhibitor (3, 4).\nPetersen, T.E. et al. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265:6104.\nForsgren, M. et al.

        "passage": " only detected tryptophan and was not capable of detecting other downstream KP metabolites. This study also failed to distinguish between MS subtype. We showed that tryptophan and 3 other metabolites of the KP were important predictors of MS subtype and correlated to disease severity scores. Indeed, the four KP predictors accounted for approximately 90% of the predictive power of our built model with the two inflammatory mediators only adding 10% predictive power. This suggests that tryptophan metabolism is more relevant to MS pathology than general inflammation. The validity of model was confirmed when applied to an alternate and independent blinded set (Test set, Cohort 3) where we observed a reproducible accuracy of 83%.\nOne potential limitation of a blood based biomarker for neurological disease may be that blood parameters may not necessarily mirror those of the CNS. However, a previous study demonstrated that the blood KP profile followed closely with changes of the KP profile in CNS40 and our analysis (which included 3 more KP variables, i.e. K/T ratio, KA and PA) showed generally good to-strong plasma-CNS KP metabolite correlations in the range 65\u201379.3%. Potential factors limiting these correlations may include the inherent differences in the magnitude of CSF parameters relative to serum values and the fact that the length of storage time (over 10 years) in some of these samples may have led to the partial degradation of some analytes. Although, the key metabolites kynurenine and QA have been reported as relatively stable even after many years of storage41. Notwithstanding these points, the moderately strong correlations between CSF and serum, confirms that the serum KP profile is a suitably sensitive blood-based predictor of disease progression in MS.\nIn conclusion, our results demonstrate that KP parameters have a strong association with MS subtype, correlating with disease severity scores. The changing levels of KP metabolites we observed also provides a mechanistic insight that may explain the transition from the milder RRMS form to the more debilitating SPMS disease form. KP profiling is likely to be relevant to the pathogenesis of other diseases characterized by inflammation and neurodegeneration, like Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease and ALS, where aberrant KP metabolism has been reported42. Our results also suggest that strategies aimed rebalancing the KP, particularly in terms of QA/KA levels, could be useful therapeutic approaches in slowing neurodegeneration in MS.\nHow to cite this article: Lim, C.

We newly developed a population PK model using sparse sampling data from patients with epilepsy, and the model better reflects the actual clinical situation.\nEpilepsy: A Clinical Overview.\nMilligan, Tracey A.\nAm J Med ; 134(7): 840-847, 2021 07.\nThe diagnosis and treatment of seizures and epilepsy is a common task of the physician. Approximately 1 in 10 people will have a seizure during their lifetime. Epilepsy is the tendency to have unprovoked seizures. Epilepsy is the fourth most common neurological disorder and affects 1 in 26 people in the United States and 65 million people worldwide. Evaluation of a patient presenting with a seizure involves excluding an underlying neurologic or medical condition, classifying the seizure type and determining if the patient has epilepsy. Proper treatment requires accurate diagnosis of the epilepsy type and syndrome and use of a medication that is effective and without adverse effects. Most patients can achieve complete seizure control with medication, but if medication is unsuccessful, surgical treatment can be an option. Special situations in the care of people with epilepsy include status epilepticus, women with epilepsy, the older adult, and safety issues.\nUse of Phenytoin, Phenobarbital Carbamazepine, Levetiracetam Lamotrigine and Valproate in Pregnancy and Breastfeeding: Risk of Major Malformations, Dose-dependency, Monotherapy vs Polytherapy, Pharmacokinetics and Clinical Implications.\nKaplan, Yusuf Cem; Demir, Omer.\nCurr Neuropharmacol ; 19(11): 1805-1824, 2021.\nIt is challenging to balance the fetal risks associated with the use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) against maternal and fetal risks of seizure worsening, and therefore it is very important to define and distinguish the possible risks entailed by different AEDs. This paper aims to undertake a comprehensive review regarding the possible risks of four classical (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and valproate) and two newer (lamotrigine and levetiracetam) AEDs during pregnancy. The review focuses on major and organ-specific malformations, dose-dependent risks, mono vs polytherapy, and clinical pharmacokinetics. A discussion regarding the safety of AED use during breastfeeding is also provided.\nSymptomatology of carbamazepine- and oxcarbazepine-induced hyponatremia in people with epilepsy.\nBerghuis, Bianca; Hulst, Janic; Sonsma, Anja; McCormack, Mark; de Haan, Gerrit-Jan; Sander, Josemir W; Lindhout, Dick; Koeleman, Bobby P C.\nOBJECTIVE: To ascertain whether adverse effects experienced by people taking carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine could be attributed to carbamazepine- or oxcarbazepine-induced hyponatremia (COIH). METHODS: We performed an observational study, collecting data between 2017 and 2019 on serum sodium levels and adverse effects retrospectively in people with epilepsy while receiving treatment with either carbamazepine (CBZ) or oxcarbazepine (OXC). We defined hyponatremia as sodium level \u2264134 mEq/L and severe hyponatremia as sodium level \u2264128 mEq/L. Adverse effects experienced were compared between groups of individuals with and without hyponatremia. RESULTS: A total of 1370 people using CBZ or OXC were identified, of whom 410 had at least one episode of hyponatremia. We checked for symptoms related to the use of CBZ and OXC in 710 people (410 with and 300 without hyponatremia) and found relevant information in 688. Adverse effects occurred in 65% of people with hyponatremia compared to 21% with normal sodium levels (odds ratio [OR] 7.5, P \u2264.001) and in 83% of people with severe hyponatremia compared to 55% in those with mild hyponatremia (P \u2264.001). Significant predictors of adverse effects were the drug (OXC vs CBZ), and the number of concomitant anti-seizure medications. Dizziness (28% vs 6%), tiredness (22% vs 7%), instability (19% vs 3%), and diplopia (16% vs 4%) were reported more often in the hyponatremia group than in patients with normal levels. SIGNIFICANCE: People with COIH had a 7-fold increased risk of developing adverse effects during treatment. Clinicians should consider ascertainment of sodium levels in patients taking CBZ and OXC and act upon findings.\nCarbamazepine-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis: the importance of HLA-B*1502 testing in at-risk populations prior to therapy initiation.\nSargent, Brynn; Juhasz, Margit L W; Joe, Victor C; Lee, Bonnie A; Rojek, Nathan W.\nInt J Dermatol ; 60(7): 907-908, 2021 Jul.\nZhang, Ruotian; Yang, Min; Li, Yang; Liu, Hedong; Ren, Maoxian; Tao, Zhou-Shan.\nJ Orthop Surg Res ; 16(1): 14, 2021 Jan 06.\nBACKGROUND: The use of antiepileptic drugs and estrogen deficiency put forward higher requirements for bone defect regeneration. The present study investigated the effects of alendronate (ALN) on femoral bone defect in ovariectomized (OVX) rats under the influence of carbamazepine (CBZ). METHODS: One hundred female SD rats at 3 months of age were either sham-operated or OVX and divided into four groups: sham control (CON); OVX control (OVX); ovariectomized rats treated with CBZ via gavage (75 mg/kg/day; CBZ); ovariectomized rats treated with CBZ plus ALN (2 mg/kg/day; CBZ-ALN). A critical-sized femoral metaphyseal bone defect was established in all female SD rats. Animals from the CBZ and CBZ-ALN groups received drugs by gavage the day after bone defect surgery was performed. After the rats were sacrificed, the defected area located in the distal femur was harvested for evaluation by microcomputed tomography (micro-CT), hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, and Masson's trichrome staining. The samples were also analyzed by biomechanics and immunohistochemical evaluation (IHC). Besides, biochemical analysis evaluates all serum samples. RESULTS: The present study showed that ovariectomy changed the microstructural parameters of bone. The use of CBZ further decreased femur bone mass while treatment with ALN prevented bone loss. Compared to OVX and CBZ groups, CBZ-ALN group promoted bone neoformation and enhanced the ultimate load of the femur bone. However, the group of CBZ-ALN did not return to normal levels compared with the CON group. Besides, we noticed that CBZ-ALN group reduced tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5b (Tracp-5b) expression and had no significant effect on the expression of osteocalcin (OCN) and type I collagen (Col-I) in IHC compared with CBZ group. Biochemical analysis results presented that systemic delivery of CBZ showed pernicious effects on bone formation and resorption in ovariectomized rats, with the worse effects on C-terminal crosslinked telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-1). Besides, a significant decrease in CTX-1 levels was observed in CBZ-ALN group as compared to the group of CBZ. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that ALN can effectively reverse the effects of CBZ on the microarchitectural properties of bone, and thus can have a positive effect on local bone neoformation in rats with osteoporosis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The dose of 2 mg/kg ALN improves the negative effect of prescription of CBZ at 75 mg/kg and promotes bone neoformation of femoral bony deficits.\nGoodman, Christopher W; Brett, Allan S.\nJAMA ; 325(7): 625-626, 2021 Feb 16.\nA 51-Year-Old Woman with Drug-Induced Hypersensitivity Syndrome Associated with Carbamazepine, Reactivation of Human Herpesvirus 6, and Acute Liver Failure: A Case Report.\nMiyasaka, Akio; Kumagai, Ichiro; Masuda, Tomoyuki; Takikawa, Yasuhiro.\nBACKGROUND Infection with human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is a recognized risk factor for the development of drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). DIHS is a systemic autoimmune condition that presents with mucocutaneous lesions of varying severity and comprises 3 subtypes: toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Here, we describe the case of a 51-year-old woman with a diagnosis of DIHS associated with carbamazepine, reactivation of HHV-6, and acute liver failure, which was consistent with DRESS. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 51-year-old Japanese woman who had been taking carbamazepine for epilepsy for the past 3 weeks. She presented with a fever, liver dysfunction, eosinophilia, and the sudden appearance of a skin rash. Steroid therapy was started for suspected drug-induced liver injury.

The MKN-45 cell line is a representative model obtained from human gastric cancer, characterized by high levels of metastasis (Takikawa et al., 2006). Invasion and metastasis are the main biological characteristics of malignant tumors, and also important factors contributing to the death of gastric cancer patients and affecting the efficacy of their treatment. Gastric cancer is the most common malignancy in Southeast Asia and is the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide causing about a million deaths annually (Kim et al., 2010; Yao et al., 2011).\nCurrent treatments for this pathology include radiation therapy, surgery and chemotherapy, the latter mainly used in the case of metastases. However, normal tissue damage due to high doses and invasiveness are important limitations for the current treatments required to eradicate cancer cells. In this sense, the use of nanoparticles is a promising area of research in the field of controlled drug release, because these systems allow a wide variety of molecules to be allocated to different tissues gradually over time. Furthermore, the use of nanoparticles minimizes active principle degradation, decreases toxicity, and increases active principle half-life in the organ to be treated (Jain, 2005; Singh, 2005).\nIn the last three decades, there have been remarkable advances in the field of nanotechnology, mainly in the use of synthetic polymers. Unlike natural polymers, synthetic polymers have greater biodegradability and biocompatibility (Lee et al., 2007). Among the synthetic polymers used in medicine the polylactic acid (PLA) and the co-polymer formed from polylactic acid and glycolic acid (PLGA) are both approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration, USA) as drug delivery systems in humans (Zille et al., 2010) and other biomedical applications such as making biodegradable sutures (Jain, 2000; Karen & Chuck, 2003). The kind of polymer used to synthesize nanoparticles significantly affects the properties and structure of the particles, and determines its possible applications, even including the way in which it is administered (Pinto Reis et al., 2006).\nNanoparticle size appears to be an important aspect. According to Sch\u00e4dlich et al. (2011) nanoparticles between 111 and 141 nm in diameter are efficiently accumulated in tumor tissue, while the liver quickly removes larger particles. Similarly, Yu et al. (2007) indicate that a continuous administration of PLA nanoparticles results in the accumulation of nanoparticles in tumor tissue.\nPLA nanoparticles have been used frequently in cancer therapy (Yang et al., 2011). PLA can be produced by the esterification of lactic acid (Zhang et al., 2005), one of the simplest chiral molecules in the cell cytoplasm. Lactic acid participates in anaerobic respiration (lactic fermentation), and during glycolysis the pyruvate is converted into lactic acid. Transcriptomic analysis of human breast cancer cells shows that the lactic acid molecule induces proliferative activity and metastasis in cancer cells, upregulates gene expression associated with embryonic stem cells, and activates gene signatures that predict a poor clinical outcome (Martinez-Outschoorn et al., 2011).\nCopper is an essential trace element for all living organisms participating in various biological functions (Evans et al., 2012; Tisato et al., 2010) such as development, immune function, neovascularization processes, maintenance of neuroendocrine function and iron metabolism (O'Dell & Sunde, 1997). After iron and zinc, copper is the most abundant mineral in human body. The normal requirements in adults range from 1.2 to 1.5 mg/day, but the body can tolerate 8 to 10 mg/day for several months and 3mg or more for longer periods of time. From yeast to humans, copper is taken up by cells through a family of highly conserved proteins called copper transporters (CTR) (Zhou & Gitschier, 1997). In humans there are two main CTR (CTR-1 and CTR-2). CTR-1 is the major functional protein, whereas CTR-2 mRNA is expressed constitutively, and its function has not been fully elucidated; however, it has been proposed that CTR-2 is related to cell absorption of copper (Blair et al., 2009). These transporters are downregulated under high extracellular concentrations of copper, removing CTR-1 from the cell surface by endocytosis and self-degradation (Petris et al., 2003).\nCopper metabolism is highly regulated by several transporters and chaperone proteins (Furukawa et al., 2008). After crossing the plasma membrane, the copper ions are transported to secretory pathways, to mitochondria, and cytosol, for making part of copper enzymes by chaperones Cox 17, Atox-1 and CCS, respectively. Cox 17 drives the copper ions to mitochondrial proteins SCO1 and SCO2, which transfer copper to the cytochrome c oxidase of the respiratory chain (Bertinato & L'Abbe, 2004). ATOX1 can deliver copper to the export pumps ATP7A or ATP7B. Alternatively, ATOX1 can function as a copper-dependent transcription factor of important cell function genes such as cyclin D (Muller & Klomp, 2009). Other data indicate that copper homeostasis is CCS-dependent, where the copper is delivered to SOD1 in mammalian cells (Caruano-Yzermans et al., 2006).\nTumor cell resistance and metastases have been related to the human copper transporter CTR-1 present in gastric mucosa (Holzer et al., 2006) and in the human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line (Chen et al., 2007). In chemotherapy the CTR-1 plays a key role in uptake of platinum drugs, e.g. cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and reduced expression of this transporter as causes tumor cell resistance (Chen et al., 2007; O'Connor, 2007).\nIn this investigation, nanoparticles of polylactic acid (Nano-PLA) and copper-loaded nanoparticles (Nano-Cu) were synthesized as copper carriers to the cancer cell target, and the cytotoxicity presented by these PLA nanoparticle systems on MKN-45 gastric cancer cells was evaluated.\nCell culture. MKN-45 cells from gastric cancer adenocarcinoma were obtained from Cell Bank, RIKEN BioResource Center and cultured at 37\u00b0C with 95% humidity and 5% CO2 in RPMI-1640 medium (Caisson Labs) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, PSA 1X (amphotericin B, streptomycin and penicillin) and pyruvate (1\u00b5M).\nPLA and CuSO4-Loaded PLA Nanoparticles. Copper-loaded nanoparticles were obtained using the double emulsion technique (w/o/w) described by Avgoustakis et al. (2002). Briefly, 0.4 ml of copper sulfate aqueous solution (CuSO4, 20mg/ml) was emulsified in 2 ml of dichloromethane solution containing 100 mg PLA (Sigma Aldrich), using 10 W probe sonication for 45 s. Subsequently, the w/o emulsion formed was placed into an aqueous solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, 12 mM) and sonicated at 18 W for 1 min. The w/o/w emulsion formed was gently stirred at room temperature until the solvent was completely evaporated. The nanoparticles were purified by applying two cycles of centrifugation (43.370 g) and reconstituted in deionized, sterilized and distilled water. Blank nanoparticles were prepared using the same method, just replacing the aqueous solution of copper sulfate with water.\nCharacterization of nanoparticles. The characterization of nanoparticles was performed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with a JEOL/JEM 1200 EX II microscope and by atomic absorption with a GBC 903 spectrophotometer for copper content of nanoparticles.\nEvaluation of cytotoxicity YO-PRO-1/IP. The Membrane Permeability/Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit with YO-PRO \u00ae -1 and propidium iodide (PI) for Flow Cytometry (Invitrogen) was used to distinguish cell apoptosis and necrosis. YO-PRO-1 stain passes selectively through the plasma membranes of apoptotic cells and labels them with moderate green fluorescence, and necrotic cells are stained red-fluorescent with PI that can intercalate with the DNA from permeabilized cells. Fluorescence is read by flow cytometry.\nFor this experiment, MKN-45 cell lines were grown in 60 mm plates with 3 mL of RPMI medium with 10% of FBS, and 1x PSA antibiotic. After 24 hours of treatment, the cultures were washed twice with 1mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then 1mL of trypsin was added to each plate to allow the release of cells from the matrix. The cells were placed in an Eppendorf tube for centrifugation for 5 minutes at 3000 rpm. Then the supernatant was removed and 1mL of PBS, 1 \u00b5L YO-PRO-1, 1 \u00b5L propidium iodide (PI) were subsequently added to each tube. Incubation was performed on ice for 30 minutes in darkness to subsequently carry out a new centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes to remove the supernatant. And finally 1mL of PBS was added per tube and analyzed using cytometry flow samples.\nCytotoxicity assays were also performed with nanoparticles loaded with copper exposed for three different periods (24, 48 and 96 hrs). For this case, the treatments were lactic acid (0.04 mM), polylactic acid (0.04 mM), Nano-PLA (0.04 mM), Nano-Cu (0.04 mM/1mM) and copper (1 mM). After the corresponding hours of treatment, the same protocol described above was conducted to analyze the samples by flow cytometry.\nCell cycle analysis by PI. MKN-45 cells were grown in 60 mm plates to assess the cell"

If a continent happens to be a place where a divergent boundary occurs, then the continent will begin to be torn apart as the sides of the plates separate, creating a rift valley. It is the Oceanic crust which sinks down into the mantle because it is denser heavier.

However, TMZ has short half\u2011life and frequently induces tumor resistance, which can limit its therapeutic efficiency. In the present study, it was hypothesized that combined treatment with TMZ and acteoside has synergistic effects in glioblastoma therapy. Using cell viability and wound\u2011healing assays, it was determined that this treatment regimen reduced cell viability and migration to a greater extent than either TMZ or acteoside alone. Following previous reports that TMZ affected autophagy in glioma cells, the present study examined the effects of TMZ + acteoside combination treatment on apoptosis and autophagy. The TMZ + acteoside combination treatment increased the cleavage of caspase\u20113 and levels of B\u2011cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl\u20112)\u2011associated X protein and phosphorylated p53, and decreased the level of Bcl\u20112. The combination treatment increased microtubule\u2011associated protein 1 light chain 3 and apoptosis\u2011related gene expression. It was also determined that TMZ + acteoside induced apoptosis and autophagy through the mitogen\u2011activated protein kinase signaling pathway. These findings suggest that acteoside has beneficial effects on TMZ\u2011based glioblastoma therapy.\nGlioblastoma is the most common type of malignant primary brain tumor and the most invasive and devastating primary brain tumor (1,2), with a median survival rate of ~18 months with aggressive multimodality therapy. Current treatment decisions are limited and include radiation, chemotherapy and surgery in combination with the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) (3,4). Despite the availability of aggressive therapies, patients with glioblastoma generally have a poor prognosis (5). TMZ is the major chemotherapeutic drug used in the clinical treatment of malignant glioblastoma (6-8); as an alkylating agent in the imidazotetrazine series, it is able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (9-11). During malignant glioblastoma progression and extensive invasion throughout the brain, steadily increasing drug resistance to TMZ decreases its therapeutic efficacy (12,13). Accordingly, novel therapeutic drugs to counter glioblastoma are urgently sought.\nPrevious studies have reported that glioma cells undergo cell death via autophagy, or type II programmed cell death, in response to TMZ (14,15). Autophagy can be inhibited by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) through the conversion of micro-tubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-I to LC3-II, thus reducing glioblastoma cell death (16,17); however, the role of autophagy is dependent on the cellular context. With the exception of a cytotoxic role during TMZ action, the induction of autophagy by cellular stress is a cytoprotective process that eliminates stress-induced cytoplasmic aggregates, organelles and macromolecules in mammalian cells through the lysosomal system. In turn, cells involved in maintaining homeostasis receive energy through these catabolic processes (18,19). The complex roles of autophagy suggest that an autophagy activator may have anticancer effects in combination with TMZ treatment by inducing glioblastoma cell autophagy without exerting deleterious effects or providing benefits to normal tissues. Of note, TMZ has exhibited synergistic therapeutic effects in combination with vitamin D, including suppressed cell viability and enhanced autophagy in glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, the combination of TMZ and vitamin D has been shown to exert anticancer effects in vivo, including reduced tumor size and prolonged survival rate. These studies suggest that combination treatment may have synergistic anticancer effects via autophagic mechanisms in TMZ-based glioblastoma therapy (15).\nActeoside is a phenylethanoid glycoside that is widely distributed in several tonified traditional Chinese herbal medicines (20,21). A number of pharmacological actions, including antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antinephritic and antimetastatic actions, have been associated with acteoside (22-24). Previous studies have demonstrated that acteoside has protective effects against carbon tetrachloride- and D-galactosamine-induced liver injury. The mechanisms underlying the protective effects of acteoside are likely related to its capacity to inhibit P450-mediated bioactivation and free radical scavenging effects induced by carbon tetrachloride exposure (25,26).\nTherefore, evidence suggests that both acteoside and TMZ induce anticancer effects through cell death. However, their association and anticancer effects in the context of glioblastoma remain to be elucidated. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to verify the synergistic anticancer effects of acteoside combined with TMZ in glioblastoma therapy. A cell viability assay was performed to analyze the anticancer effects of the combination treatment in C6 glioblastoma cells (a rat glioblastoma cell line), and the results were compared with those following treatment with TMZ alone. To further examine the mechanism of cell death caused by cotreatment with acteoside and TMZ, apoptosis- and autophagy-related genes in C6 cells were examined.\nThe C6 rat glioblastoma cell line was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA). The cells were cultured under sterile conditions at 37\u00b0C in a humid environment with 5% of CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1% antibiotics and antimycotics (all Welgene, Daegu, Korea).\nAbeliophyllum distichum Nakai [voucher no. Park1001(ANH)] was collected in Misunhyang Theme park, Seongbul-Mountain Recreation Forest, 78, Chungmin-rogigok-gil, Goesan-eup, Goesan-gun, Chungcheongbuk-do, Korea.\nTo induce callus formation (27), 1-cm2 leaf explants were isolated from the fresh plants. The explant was cultured on Murachige and Skoog medium (4% sucrose, 0.9% agar supplemented with 1 mg/l naphthalene acetic acid and 1 mg/l 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, pH 5.7) at 25\u00b0C. The callus was induced 20 days later. A sufficient quantity of acteoside was obtained through subculture to separate and purify acteoside from the callus (Fig. 1). Different batches of purified acteoside were used in each experiment. Each experiment was performed three times using a different batch.\nThe ethylacetate fractions were concentrated in vacuo and used as a sample for the purification of acteoside. Acteoside was isolated and purified by the Accelerated Chromatographic Isolation system (Isolera\u2122 Spektra, Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden) using SNAP KPHOSPHO-SIL and SNAP Ultra Cartridges (Biotage). The acteoside purified from the callus was quantitatively analyzed using the standard acteoside by HPLC-PDA analysis. Finally, acteoside of \u226595% purity was obtained from the callus and used as a sample for chemotherapy of temozolomide-based glioblastoma.\nTo identify the TMZ half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 value) against C6 cells, 1\u00d7104 cells in single cell suspensions were seeded into individual wells of 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C prior to TMZ treatment at the indicated concentrations (1, 5, 10, and 20 mM) at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. Following determination of the TMZ IC50 value as 5 mM, the cells were treated for 24 h with 5 mM TMZ, 50 \u00b5M acteoside, or a combination of the two (5 mM TMZ"

It means that they won\u2019t write a dirty review in your customer book or make an adverse comment on the web page! Nevertheless, this is not to that you should depart basic machismo just because it looks good in the Russian female\u2019s eyes.\nAnother great way to find a Russian woman is to apply a Russian online dating website. This site is very easy to use, using a simple creating an account process and a mobile phone app that has night mode for reduced eye strain. Other features that make this site stand out range from the ability to hunt for profiles on your mobile phone, add your favorites to your favorites, and communicate via video and sound phone calls. You can also flick through their repository and search by requirements of your choice.\nA unique characteristic of Russian women is the flower-based dating culture. These girls love to acquire gifts, which will make them feel special. It\u2019s also common to give them something special of some sort. Small gift ideas are often ideal, but a present up to $22.99 is usually treasured. Russian females like surprises and attention, so you\u2019ll want to make sure the gifts reflect that. This way, you can make your Russian female feel extra special by making her feel valued and appreciated.\nThe same holds true when it comes to dressing up. Russian women dress in a way that suggests that men should decorate for a time. They tend to pay attention to the state of all their nails and hands. In the event that they\u2019re within a state of disrepair, they\u2019ll in all probability take this personally. Nevertheless, you don\u2019t have to look like a knight to impress a Russian female. A little effort will go a long way!\nCompared to their particular American alternative, Russian ladies often look after their families. They rarely place themselves over others. It means that they will make the best wife and mother in the world. A nice bonus is the fact that Russian women of all ages are very quick to learn English language, making them appealing to western males. It\u2019s not hard to see why Russian ladies are so well-liked by western men. After all, they are yet to experienced so much.<|endoftext|>Liewood Sylvester Washcloth - Superhero Multi Mix is backordered and will ship as soon as it is back in stock.\nLooking to add a little more fun to your everyday routine? \nHave the perfect bath mitts?

Typical symptoms comprise necrotic spots on leaves, canker and dieback on canes and trunks, twig wilting, and blossom necrosis. Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa), which is the causal agent of kiwifruit bacterial canker, is divided into four biovars based on multilocus sequence analysis of different genes, additional PCR testing of pathogenic genes (argKtox cluster, cfl, and various effector genes), and biochemical and physiological characterization. Bacterial canker caused by Psa biovar 2 designated Psa2 was detected for the first time on the green-fleshed kiwifruit cultivar Hayward in 1988 and the yellow-fleshed kiwifruit cultivar Hort16A in 2006 in Korea. Psa biovar 3 designated Psa3, responsible for the current global pandemics of kiwifruit bacterial canker, began to appear in Korea in 2011 and caused tremendous economic losses by destroying many vines or orchards of yellow-fleshed kiwifruit cultivars in one or several growing seasons. Bacterial canker epidemics caused by both Psa2 and Psa3 are prevalent in Korea in recent years. In this review, we summarize the symptomatology, etiology, disease cycle, diagnosis, and epidemiology of kiwifruit bacterial canker in Korea.\n\n\nIntroduction\nKiwifruit is native to China and surrounding Asian countries. There are more than 70 individual species within the Actinidia genus, and most of them grow as rampant vines in forests (Ferguson, 2010). Among commercially cultivated Actinidia species, A. deliciosa and A. chinensis are major species. The most popular cultivars Hayward and Hort16A, which were bred in New Zealand, belong to A. deliciosa and A. chinensis, respectively. The green-fleshed kiwifruit cultivar Hayward was introduced into Korea in 1970s while the yellow-fleshed kiwifruit cultivar Hort16A has been cultivated on Jeju Island since 2004. Several yellow-fleshed kiwifruit cultivars such as Haegeum, Jecygold, and Halla-gold were bred in Korea, and other cultivars were imported from China and New Zealand.\nThe cultivation and production of kiwifruit are rapidly skyrocketing due to the strong market demand of consumers in recent years (Fig. 1). The cultivation acreage for kiwifruit in 2015 reached up to approximately 1,300 ha, comprising 45%, 31%, and 24% located in Jeonnam, Gyeongnam, and Jeju provinces, respectively. Major cultivation regions with their acreages are shown in Fig. 2. Green-fleshed kiwifruit cultivars occupy 65% of the acreage, followed by 33% for yellow-fleshed kiwifruit cultivars and 2% for red-fleshed kiwifruit cultivars.\nBacterial canker is the largest limiting factor in the cultivation and production of kiwifruit. Kiwifruit bacterial canker was detected for the first time in 1984 on a greenfleshed kiwifruit cultivar Hayward in Japan Takikawa et al., 1989), and the disease also occurred in Korea (Koh and Lee, 1992;Koh et al., 1994) and China (Wang et al., 1992). Many orchards in Japan and Korea were completely destroyed by bacterial canker epidemics during that time, resulting in huge economic losses to Hayward growers. Around the same time, the disease also occurred in Italy (Scortichini, 1994) but did not have as severe an impact as in Japan and Korea. For this reason, bacterial canker had not received worldwide attention until massive outbreaks on the yellow-fleshed kiwifruit cultivar Hort16A in major kiwifruit-growing countries.\nBacterial canker on the yellow-fleshed kiwifruit cultivar Hort16A occurred for the first time in Korea (Koh et al., 2010) in 2006, followed by Italy (Balestra et al., 2009(Balestra et al., ) in 2008. The disease has been reported in Portugal (Balestra et al., 2010), Spain (Abelleira et al., 2011), France (Vanneste et al., 2011b, and Turkey (Bastas and Karakaya, 2012) in Europe as well as New Zealand (Everett et al., 2011) and Chile (EPPO, 2011) on other continents. Currently, bacterial canker has spread to a pandemic scale worldwide and causes tremendous economic losses by destroying kiwifruit vines or orchards in one or several growing seasons.\n\nEtiology\nPseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) is the causal agent of bacterial canker of kiwifruit. This pathogen, belonging to the Family Pseudomonadaceae and Order Pseudomonadales, was first described in Japan in 1989 by Takikawa et al. (1989). It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, motile, and rod-shaped bacterium with polar flagella, oxidase-negative, arginine dihydrolase-negative, opaque, pale-yellowish, and formed circular colonies on peptone sucrose agar media (Fig. 3).\nHigh-throughput sequences have led to deep genome analysis based on molecular markers such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) of different genes such as housekeeping, type III effectors, and phytotoxins. This has allowed a phylogenetic tree to be drawn based on the alignment on many core genome protein sequences as well as an understanding of the phylogenetic connections between different Psa isolates worldwide (Donati et al., 2014). Based on these analyses, global Psa populations were mainly divided into three lineages (biovars 1, 2, and 3) designated Psa1, Psa2, and Psa3, respectively (Chapman et al., 2012).\nThe first lineage Psa1, isolated in Japan in 1984  and Italy in 1992 (Scortichini, 1994), possesses the chromosomal phaseolotoxin gene cluster acquired by horizontal gene transfer (Sawada et al., 1997(Sawada et al.,, 1999(Sawada et al.,, 2002. The second lineage Psa2, distributed only in Korea, possesses the coronatine gene cluster instead of the phaseolotoxin gene cluster as phytotoxins (Han et al., 2003). The third lineage Psa3, responsible for the current bacterial canker pandemics worldwide, is characterized by the lack of genes expressing either phaseolotoxin or coronatine and possesses four putative hop genes encoding effector proteins.\nPsa3, responsible for the current bacterial canker pandemics worldwide, began to appear from central Italy since 2008 (Ferrante and Scortichini, 2009). This pathogen has rapidly spread to other kiwifruit-producing regions in Italy and has been reported in other European countries. On other continents, it has also been detected in New Zealand (Everett et al., 2011) and Chile (EPPO, 2011). A coordinated study on core genome SNPs and integrative conjugative elements (ICEs), combined with disease history, led to the hypothesis that the European, New Zealand, Chilean, and Korean strains of Psa3 are of Chinese origin (Butler et al., 2013(Butler et al.,, 2015Marcelletti et al., 2011;McCann et al., 2013).  In Korea, the first bacterial canker by Psa2 was observed on Hayward in 1988 (Koh and Lee, 1992) and Hort16A in 2006 (Koh et al., 2010) on Jeju Island. Psa3 was first detected in 2011 on the yellow-fleshed kiwifruit cultivar Yellow-king and red-fleshed kiwifruit cultivar Hongyang in Goheung, Jeonnam province (Koh et al., 2012). Since then, frequent Psa3 incidences have occurred on yellow-and red-fleshed kiwifruit cultivars in major kiwifruit growing areas in Korea. Annual monitoring of Psa population enables estimation of various genetic"

The shopping centre presents a blank windowless face to those outside, blank, and impenetrable, and yet get inside and it oozes with activity at this time of year.

I walk on and want to catch my breath as it appears against the clear blue sky of recent weeks. Its ancient stones need no false lighting, as the walls, which were built to keep people out, seem to sparkle in their newly cleared and cleaned state, the overgrowth of too many years removed to make it appear a more welcome place, with thanks to my kind colleagues at the County Council and their contractors with their clever scaffold and heads for height. The recent work has once more unconcealed the windows, high up in what is the earliest stone tower in Oxford, and in England, originally designed to be part of Oxford\u2019s town wall and then built into the later castle. I look up and can picture a scene where Empress Matilda would lower herself down dressed in white as disguise to cross the snow to Wallingford, to escape from her cousin Stephen who would go on to steal the crown and prevent her from becoming the first English queen. There are so many stories to tell, to which the crowds who came to the Castleyard for the Oxford Christmas Light Festival can attest, with the history of the city captured in the extraordinary lighting spectacular arranged by OPT and TORCH to celebrate 950 years of Oxford Castle and all played out against the backdrop of the Castle buildings, and with the shadowy figure of Matilda stealing across the scene.<|endoftext|>Extreme Reaction Force - How is Extreme Reaction Force abbreviated?\nJamal said victims of the Extreme Reaction Force were paraded in front of cells.<|endoftext|>As an accounting leader, it is important to invest in your people.

So, I don't know what kind of support you have to help you with the children. If you're a single mom and you have young children, often you can feel like you work just to pay for daycare. If this is your case then you can often start resenting your job for taking you away from your children and leaving you with very little money to show for all your efforts. If these are your realities, then once again focus on changing your perspective about your work and start getting motivated to change your work situation with some support.\nIf you have great allies, or at the very least trustworthy and dependable people that can help you from time to time, reach out and treat yourself to some \u201cme-time\u201d or time with your friends. Look at taking time for you as a gift to your children. If mommy gets her needs met then she will be an even better, more fulfilled, happy mommy...ready to take on that great next adventure with ease and an energized presence. If you don\u2019t take time out for you, you may be depriving your children of getting the \u201cbest you\u201d that they can have.\nWhen you don't get your needs met you tend to be distracted with unfinished nagging tasks or by your thoughts and wishes to get what you want or need. These distractions keep you from being fully present with your children, at work or with someone else.\n Take time to look at all you are; see all your great qualities. Recognize all that you have accomplished. If you have a hard time with this, then reach out and I'll help you spell it out clearly.\nIf you do have a significant other, then the fact that you didn't even mention them says to me that you're not getting all the support you need and your relationship could need some TLC, too. Find a way to communicate your feelings, your wants and needs to them, so they can help you.\nOften our partners are clueless to what we really need, until we tell them. Most of the time, we are even in the dark about it, too. This is another reason to get clarity. If you have a partner and they're not supportive of you or your needs; if they are not one that you can easily communicate with, then they\u2019re not getting what they really need either. If they were, they would be more supportive, happier and more attentive to you. If this is something you can relate to, then know you're not alone. Very few people are taught how to take care of their own needs or how to communicate effectively. The great thing is\u2026it\u2019s never too late to learn! Just as it is never too late to learn how to use A Mom's Guilt, to empower you.\nFrom what you've written, it sounds to me like you're lacking some security in your life. Perhaps you need to feel more important, beyond being Mom. Figure out what's really missing and then devise a plan to go after what you want more of in your life. If you do this, you will be more fulfilled, you will have more to give others and you will be an even better role model.\n\nIf you'd like to share more information or ask another question, please contact me so I can help you get more of what you want and need in you life, love and work.<|endoftext|>SICK of the cycle!!!!!!\n\nI feel like screaming with anger and crying with despair right now, really need to get it off my chest to people who will understand!\n\nAlongside PMDD i also struggle with anxiety, depression, and an eating disorder (also questionable substance 'use'), and what gets me so down about my cycle are the effects that it has on these other issues in addition to it just being shit on its own.

The survey was conducted by an Ad Hoc Committee on Graduate Programs released in early February, Davidson said via email.\nThe proposal will be reviewed soon by the faculty Committee on Academic Planning (CAP) and the Graduate Council Committee (GCC), which work together to evaluate all of the College\u2019s graduate programs.\nThe decision will ultimately be made by President Vickers and other members of the administration. The dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, James Wright, commented, \u201cThis is a faculty matter at this point.\u201d He emphasized that the administration has not started to make any final decisions on the matter.\nthe part-time professors as necessary, and does not want to alter the situation, as it works well.\nIn addition to the presence of teaching assistants on the staff, the Committee also mentioned the high departmental turn-over rate that the department, again, does not see as problematic. George Pahomov, a full-time professor of Russian, said some people come to Bryn Mawr \u201cto teach one course to fit the needs of the department,\u201d and then leave. However, the resultant diversity of teaching styles in the Russian department from year to year is a benefit, say Pahomov and Davidson.\nsearch, he said.\nIn addition to the loss of a potential full-time professor, the Russian department recently lost a tenure-track position. Several years ago, the Board of Trustees created a \u201cfinancial equilibrium\u201d plan for the College. Part of this plan includes keeping the number of tenured faculty constant: so, whenever a tenure-track position in one department is created, such a position in another department must be eliminated. According to Pahomov, the Computer Science department, which gained the new tenure-track position, \u201cdesperately needed another appointed faculty member.\u201d There are other \u201coversubscribed\u201d departments as well, he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re a small college, probably with more programs than anyplace else our size,\u201d Pahomov said, adding that the number of good programs at Bryn Mawr necessitates the \u201cfinancial equilibrium\u201d concept in order to keep all the departments equally staffed.\nEndowment for the Humanities to come to Bryn Mawr to study the Russian program. In addition, the textbooks, videos and CD-ROMS that have become the standards for teaching Russian were all written by Bryn Mawr faculty and alumni, wrote Davidson, and some of the best Russian programs outside Bryn Mawr, such as those at the University of Texas and Ohio State, were started by alumni of the graduate school. Last year alumna Elizabeth McKay won the Pulitzer Prize for her reporting from Moscow for the Wall Street Journal.\nresearch all in the same place.\nRussian major Olivia Tomaselli (BMC \u201900) is working to unite undergraduates in support of keeping the program by encouraging them to write letters to President Vickers, and is arranging a meeting between Vickers and undergraduate Russian students to discuss the issue. \u201cThe graduate students have served as our teachers, our mentors and our friends. Without them, the energy level of the department is sure to decrease significantly,\u201d she wrote in an email.\nGraduate students are also voicing their opinions, Ph.D. candidate in Russian and Second Language Acquisition Natasha Vanyushkina, who also earned her second master\u2019s degree at Bryn Mawr, said that she believed most of the graduate students are not worried as much about the effects on themselves as the \u201cglobal and far-reaching effects\u201d of the elimination of the program on the world of Russian scholarship. Another affected sector in Russian studies would be the undergraduate Russian students at Bryn Mawr, said Vanyushkina.\ngraduate courses as undergraduates.

However, a translation of cellular in vitro findings to an actual in vivo context remains challenging. Here, physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling was used for in vivo contextualization of in vitro toxicity data (PICD) to quantitatively predict in vivo drug response over time by integrating multiple levels of biological organization. Explicitly, in vitro toxicity data at the cellular level were integrated into whole-body PBPK models at the organism level by coupling in vitro drug exposure with in vivo drug concentration\u2013time profiles simulated in the extracellular environment within the organ. PICD was exemplarily applied on the hepatotoxicant azathioprine to quantitatively predict in vivo drug response of perturbed biological pathways and cellular processes in rats and humans. The predictive accuracy of PICD was assessed by comparing in vivo drug response predicted for rats with observed in vivo measurements. To demonstrate clinical applicability of PICD, in vivo drug responses of a critical toxicity-related pathway were predicted for eight patients following acute azathioprine overdoses. Moreover, acute liver failure after multiple dosing of azathioprine was investigated in a patient case study by use of own clinical data. Simulated pharmacokinetic profiles were therefore related to in vivo drug response predicted for genes associated with observed clinical symptoms and to clinical biomarkers measured in vivo. PICD provides a generic platform to investigate drug-induced toxicity at a patient level and thus may facilitate individualized risk assessment during drug development.\n\n\nIntroduction\nDrug-induced toxicity is a major clinical problem (Schuster et al. 2005) with cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity being the most frequent clinical cases (Von Hoff et al. 1977;Andrade et al. 2005;Takikawa et al. 2009). The predictability of specific toxic events is a major challenge in pharmaceutical development since the underlying origins are almost unforeseeable (Kaplowitz 2004). In drug development, whole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are nowadays routinely used (Jones et al. 2006;Maharaj et al. 2013;Lippert et al. 2013). Wholebody PBPK modeling describes biological processes underlying drug pharmacokinetics at a large scale of physiological detail and may be used among others to simulate interstitial concentration-time profiles in the extracellular environment of various organs (Jones et al. 2009;Kuepfer 2010). PBPK modeling aims for a mechanistic understanding of physiological processes describing drug absorption, Abstract Understanding central mechanisms underlying drug-induced toxicity plays a crucial role in drug development and drug safety. However, a translation of cellular in vitro findings to an actual in vivo context remains challenging. Here, physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling was used for in vivo contextualization of in vitro toxicity data (PICD) to quantitatively predict in vivo drug response over time by integrating multiple levels of biological organization. Explicitly, in vitro toxicity data at the cellular level were integrated into whole-body PBPK models at the organism level by coupling in vitro drug exposure with in vivo drug concentration-time profiles simulated in the extracellular environment within the organ. PICD was exemplarily applied on the hepatotoxicant azathioprine to quantitatively predict in vivo drug response of perturbed biological pathways and cellular processes in rats and humans. The predictive accuracy of PICD was assessed by comparing in vivo drug response predicted for rats with observed in vivo measurements. To demonstrate clinical applicability of PICD, in vivo drug responses of a critical toxicity-related pathway were predicted for eight patients following acute azathioprine overdoses. Moreover, distribution, metabolism and elimination (ADME) within the body based on prior physiological and anatomical knowledge. Different organs are explicitly represented in PBPK models and are connected by blood flow (Fig. S1). Since PBPK models describe the physiology of an organism at a high level of detail, they can be used to simulate pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of specific patient subgroups with individualized physiology (Maharaj et al. 2013;Lippert et al. 2013).\nIn order to detect drug-induced injury at an early stage, reliable predictions of toxic events as well as representative diagnostic biomarkers are of key relevance for patient safety (Shi et al. 2010). This also requires a mechanistic understanding of the underlying cellular processes (Bissell et al. 2001;Schimmel et al. 2004;Holt and Ju 2006;Russmann et al. 2009). Current advances in systems toxicology provide novel insights into central mechanisms involved in drug-induced toxicity (Waters and Fostel 2004;Heijne et al. 2005;Chen et al. 2012). Changes at different biological levels can nowadays be measured by -omics technologies to describe cellular alterations in response to toxic drug concentrations. Transcriptome profiling was successfully applied before to study adverse effects of toxic agents (Hockley et al. 2006;Brynildsen and Liao 2009;Michaelson et al. 2011;Zhang et al. 2012;Van Delft et al. 2012;Iskar et al. 2013;Doktorova et al. 2013;Zhang et al. 2014;Herpers et al. 2015). Combined application of different profiling techniques allows linking cellular changes at multiple levels of biological organization that finally facilitates the characterization of molecular mechanisms of toxic events (Carreras Puigvert et al. 2013;Wilmes et al. 2013;Pillai et al. 2014). Furthermore, reverse toxicokinetics were used before to identify steady state blood concentrations for correlations of in vivo equivalent doses with in vitro bioactivity data (Dix et al. 2007;Judson et al. 2011;Wetmore et al. 2013;Judson et al. 2014). In another study, physiologically based kinetic models developed for different glycol ethers were used to estimate dose-response curves in rats and humans (Louisse et al. 2010). However, a systematic consideration of in vitro toxicity data into an in vivo context, thereby reflecting temporal cellular changes induced by drugs administered in vivo, remains still challenging.\nIn this article, PBPK-based in vivo contextualization of in vitro toxicity data (PICD) is presented. PICD integrates in vitro toxicity data into drug-specific whole-body PBPK models to translate drug-induced in vitro findings to an actual in vivo situation, thereby predicting drug-specific response profiles induced by different dose levels administered in vivo. At the cellular level, in vitro toxicity data are coupled with equivalent PBPK-simulated concentration-time profiles at the organism level to allow a quantitative description of time-resolved in vivo drug response of key cellular processes and biological pathways. Applying PICD in clinical research allows the quantitative prediction of patient-specific drug response by specifically incorporating patient physiology in individualized PBPK models. In brief, PICD aims for a translation of preclinical in vitro toxicity data into an in vivo context and hence allows risk assessment for individual patients during drug development.\nPICD is exemplarily applied on the hepatotoxicant azathioprine in humans and rats. As input, human and rat PBPK models of azathioprine are developed and in vitro toxicity data are analyzed (Fig. 1). Explicitly, time series gene expression profiles of primary human and rat hepatocytes from Open TG-GATEs (Igarashi et al. 2015), a large-scale toxicogenomics database, represent the in vitro toxicity data. The predictive quality of PICD is assessed by in vivo response data measured in rat livers (Igarashi et al. 2015), thus exploring whether predicted in vivo drug response shows in vivo relevance (Fig. 1). To assess the predictive accuracy of PICD, in vivo data are necessary for validation purposes. Since in vivo response data from liver biopsies were available in rats (Igarashi et al. 2015), PICD was applied on rats to assess whether predicted drug response shows in vivo relevance (Fig. 1). PICD is then applied for humans to predict in vivo drug response over time for doses estimated to be the in vivo equivalents for concentrations exposed in vitro (Fig. 1). Note that the application of PICD in rats and humans is fully independent since apart from the validation step no information from the animal study was further used for the human case. To demonstrate the potential of PICD for clinical applications in humans, acute toxicity is investigated after single and multiple dosing of azathioprine. Patient-specific in vivo drug response over time following documented cases of acute azathioprine overdose is predicted specifically considering patient physiology (Gregoriano et al. 2014;Fig. 1).

Sporting the tagline \"Avenge the Fallen,\" the posters are all close-ups of characters' faces, and as expected, many of them confirm what the trailers have already told us.\nWe know already that the film will feature the survivors of Thanos' (Josh Brolin) snap \u2014 among them Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Iron Man (Tony Stark), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) \u2014 enacting some kind of last-ditch plan to take back what they lost, with a little help from their new friend Captain Marvel (Brie Larson). Those characters, in keeping with the most recent trailer, are shown in color on their posters. Characters who didn't survive \u2014 including Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Vision (Paul Bettany), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) \u2014 appear in black and white.\nThis is all pretty easy to follow, but what makes this batch of posters particularly interesting is that they seem to confirm a few things we didn't know for sure about various supporting characters, and the biggest news seems to be that Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) is alive and well following the snap, and will apparently join the fight in the new film. Thor's new ally and fan-favorite character from Thor: Ragnarok was last seen onboard the Asgardian refugee ship at the end of that film, but didn't make an appearance in Avengers: Infinity War, leading many fans to worry about her eventual fate.\nAlso alive: Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), Tony's loyal bodyguard and friend who was last seen in Spider-Man: Homecoming, and Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), Tony's fiance. Sadly, the posters also confirm some people we lost off-camera, like Shuri (Letitia Wright), Black Panther's science genius little sister. That's a gut punch.\nNotably, the posters also include three characters who died in the last film in ways other than the snap: Loki, who was choked to death by Thanos; Gamora, who was thrown of a cliff by Thanos; and Vision, who was killed when Thanos ripped the Mind Stone from his skull.\nObviously we don't expect characters like Black Panther and Spider-Man to stay dead forever, and the Avengers' ultimate plan is expected to restore a lot of things to the MCU, but will that include characters who were dead before the snap even happened? This remains one of the film's biggest mysteries, and these posters only add to the suspense.

The network infrastructure of existing core networks is currently undergoing atransformation from rings using SONET Add/Drop Multiplexers (ADMs) to mesh topologiesusing Optical Cross-connects (OXCs). A core optical network architecture can be opaque ortransparent. An opaque architecture means that the optical signal carrying traffic undergoesan Optical to Electronic to Optical (OEO) conversion at different places in the network. Atransparent architecture means that the optical signal carrying traffic stays in the opticaldomain from the time it is generated at the edge of the network until it leaves the network.Even though the applications driving thelarge scaledeployment of transparent optical switches are notcurrently in place (niche applications in today\u2019s networks onlyuse a very small number of transparent switches), and the trafficdemand does notcurrently justify theuse of transparentswitches that are cost effective at very high bit rates,it is possible that atsome point in the futuretransparent switches may be deployed in the network. Based on thisassumption, this paper explores the technology issues and challenges that are associated with3D MEMS-based switch fabrics. These fabrics offer the most viable approach to makesingle-stage switch fabrics with large portcounts that can be used for thedeployment of transparent switches in the network.Figure illustrates the four different node architectures that can comprise a core optical1network. The first architecture shows a fixed patch panel. Fixed patch panels located betweenWDM systems with transponders are currently being replaced by opaque (OEO) switchingnodes (with electrical switch fabrics) as shown in architectureof Figure (b). This is an1 opaque network architecture, as the optical signal undergoes OEO conversions [2]. The thirdarchitecture shows a transparent (OOO) switch between WDM systems with transpondersthat iscomplemented by an OEO switch for drop traffic.

It is undeniable that this rape culture did not grow overnight.\nThere is an underlying reason for it: A culture of impunity. But the time is now to fight back against violence against women.\nAfter a home-maker was raped and tortured on September 2 in Begumganj upazila of Noakhali, people from all around the country began protesting for justice.\nWhat\u2019s ridiculous is that the police, who are responsible for ensuring the safety of all citizens, came to know about this heinous incident over a month later when footage of the assault went viral on Facebook. This is a reflection of how prompt police officers are at fulfilling their key responsibilities.\nThis is not a rare case in the history of Bangladesh. There have been numerous times when women had to experience harassment in schools, workplaces, and outside.\nAccording to Ain O Salish Kendra, from January to September this year, 975 women were raped, 43 of whom died after, and 12 committed suicide after being raped.\nA media report says that the number of rape incidents was 1,413 last year. This clearly demonstrates that occurrences of sexual harassment is widespread. And these are only the ones which have been reported.\n If no, what is the judiciary doing? What are the police officers for? What are the judges for?\nAround 200,000 cases of abuse involving women and children are pending in 64 districts across the country.\nOut of them, 40,000 have been pending for more than five years; nearly 70% of these 40,000 cases have been waiting more than 10 years to be disposed of.\nSeeing these frustrating statistics of negligence by the justice departments, it can definitely be said that a culture of impunity is one of the prime reasons for such a spike in rape cases"

I literally had no idea what the flip was going on so I through myself out of bed and made my way through the dark towards the familiar voice. Along with it being pitch black the room was being swayed from side to side so I couldn\u2019t even stand. It was a feeling that you would normally experiences on a roller coast on the Gold Coast. I tripped over my sister\u2019s bed and didn\u2019t even make it to the doorway I just crouched down and waited for this bad dream like event to end.\nThe earthquake was said to have lasted 45 seconds, which seemed like a cliqued forever. After the loud rumbling ended the building continued to lurch from side to side as the shockwaves faded. Initially I felt sick, I felt I had been at Dream World on the Gold Coast. We spend a few minutes gathering some things and putting on some warmer clothes and then headed out of the room into a city that would be changed indefinitely. We were guided down a cracked stairwell by a hotel employee and went out onto the chilly street, along with the jaded hotel staff and tourists.\nI remember leaving the hotel room and seeing a smashed vase on the level floor, with glass and water all over the floor. This first hit me as I realised damage has been done.\nWe waited out in the cold until we finally could contact mum and then proceeded to walk through our shaken city to a point where we could meet. We walked through streets with bricks covering the road, cracks in the footpath and odd piles of sand making it look like the sandman had stopped by. After a bumpy ride home we all fell asleep around the fire in our cold dark house.<|endoftext|>Yahoo is in the headlines \u2013 again \u2013 for a big problem.

        "passage": " every thought and circumstance of life flash vividly into and across the mind.\nMany persons do, however, remember that they have lived before. Poets have sung of this, children know it well, until the constant living in an atmosphere of unbelief drives the recollection from their minds for the present, but all are subject to the limitations imposed upon the Ego by the new brain in each life. This is why we are not able to keep the pictures of the past, whether of this life or the preceding ones. The brain is the instrument for the memory of the soul, and, being new in each life with but a certain capacity, the Ego is only able to use it for the new life up to its capacity. That capacity will be fully availed of or the contrary, just according to the Ego's own desire and prior conduct, because such past living will have increased or diminished its power to overcome the forces of material existence.\nBy living according to the dictates of the soul the brain may at least be made porous to the soul's recollections; if the contrary sort of a life is led, then more and more will clouds obscure that reminiscence. But as the brain had no part in the life last lived, it is in general unable to remember. And this is a wise law, for we should be very miserable if the deeds and scenes of our former lives were not hidden from our view until by discipline we become able to bear a knowledge of them.\nAnother objection brought up is that under the doctrine of reincarnation it is not possible to account for the increase of the world's population. This assumes that we know surely that its population has increased and are keeping informed of its fluctuations. But it is not certain that the inhabitants of the globe have increased, and, further, vast numbers of people are annually destroyed of whom we know nothing. In China year after year many thousands have been carried off by flood. Statistics of famine have not been made. We do not know by how many thousands the deaths in Africa exceed the births in any year. The objection is based on imperfect tables which only have to do with western lands. It also assumes that there are fewer Egos out of incarnation and waiting to come in than the number of those inhabiting bodies, and this is incorrect. Annie Besant has put this well in her \"Reincarnation\" by saying that the inhabited globe resembles a hall in a town which is filled from the much greater population of the town outside; the number in the hall may vary, but there is a constant source of supply from the town. It is true that so far as concerns this globe the number of Egos belonging to it is definite; but no one knows what that quantity is nor what is the total capacity of the earth for sustaining them. The statisticians of the day are chiefly in the West, and their tables embrace but a small section of the history of man. They cannot say how many persons were incarnated on the earth at any prior date when the globe was full in all parts, hence the quantity of egos willing or waiting to be reborn is unknown to the men of today. The Masters of theosophical knowledge say that the total number of such egos is vast, and for that reason the supply of those for the occupation of bodies to be born over and above the number that die is sufficient. Then too it must be borne in mind that each ego for itself varies the length of stay in the post-mortem states. They do not reincarnate at the same interval, but come out of the state after death at different rates, and whenever there occurs a great number of deaths by war, pestilence, or famine, there is at once a rush of souls to incarnation, either in the same place or in some other place or race. The earth is so small a globe in the vast assemblage of inhabitable planets there is a sufficient supply of Egos for incarnation here. But with due respect to those who put this objection, I do not see that it has the slightest force or any relation to the truth of the doctrine of reincarnation.<|endoftext|>Llabr\u00e9s i Xamena, F.X.; Bordiga, S.; Paz\u00e8, C. et al.\nIchida, M.; Hamanaka, Y.; Kataura, H. et al.\nIchimura, K.; Osawa, M.; Nomura, K. et al.\nHongo, H.; Nihey, F.; Yudasaka, M. et al.\nTakikawa, H.; Kato, M.; Hibi, Y. et al.\nMasubuchi, S.; Ooiwa, K.; Kataura, H. et al.\nOchiai, Y.; Enomoto, R.; Ishii, S. et al.\nNakaoka, N.; Tada, K.; Watanabe, K.\nAndo, T.; Matsumura, H.; Nakanishi, T.\nNerushev, O.

Israel annexed East Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognized and claims the entire city as its capital.\nAhead of the march, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said that \u201cflying the flag of Israel in Israel\u2019s capital is an obvious thing\u201d and that Israel had made that clear \u201cfrom the start\u201d. At the same time, he asked attendees to celebrate in a \u201cresponsible and respectful way\u201d.\nThousands of people normally take part in the march through the Muslim quarter of the Old City, including some who shout nationalist or racist slogans towards Palestinians, before heading towards the Western Wall in the Jewish quarter.\nLast year, after weeks of Israeli-Palestinian unrest in Jerusalem, authorities changed the route of the march at the last minute to avoid the Muslim Quarter. But by then it was too late, and Hamas militants in Gaza fired a barrage of rockets towards Jerusalem as the procession began. This sparked 11 days of heavy fighting.\nHamas leaders in Gaza praised what they called \u201cthe great heroism\u201d shown by the Palestinians at Al Aqsa earlier on Sunday. \u201cThe Arab-Palestinian Islamic identity of the Al Aqsa Mosque will be protected by our people and their valiant resistance with all their might,\u201d said Hazem Qassem, spokesperson for the group.\nThe group, however, may be hesitant to get involved in another round of fights. Gaza was hard hit by last year\u2019s war, and the territory is still struggling to repair the damage. In addition, some 12,000 Gaza workers are now allowed to work inside Israel as part of efforts to maintain calm between the enemies. Resuming fighting could risk losing those jobs, which have given a small boost to Gaza\u2019s devastated economy.\nEarly on Sunday, some 1,800 Jews visited the disputed hilltop compound where the Al Aqsa Mosque is located, according to Israel Police.\nDozens of Palestinians barricaded themselves inside the mosque and began throwing objects and fireworks as Jewish visitors began arriving.\nThe Palestinians shouted \u201cGod is great\u201d while Ben-Gvir, accompanied by the Israeli police, shouted \u201cthe Jewish people live\u201d. Police said they locked the doors of the mosque and said they made 18 arrests. No injuries were reported.\nPolice also said dozens of visitors to one of the Jewish groups \u201cviolated the visiting rules\u201d. He said the group was kicked out and some people were arrested.\nPolice later said Palestinians threw rocks and bottles at security forces near Damascus Gate, at the entrance to the Muslim Quarter. Policemen were seen beating Palestinians. Police said three people were arrested and an Israeli bodyguard was lightly injured.\nAn additional 800 Jews visited the compound Sunday afternoon without incident, police said.\n\u201cWe will not allow any instigators or rioters to sabotage today\u2019s events and disturb public order,\u201d he said. By noon, the visits had temporarily ceased and the situation had calmed down.\nIsrael captured East Jerusalem, along with the West Bank and Gaza, in the 1967 Middle East War. The internationally-backed Palestinian Authority, which administers areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, seeks to create a Independent state in these three areas.<|endoftext|>MG Motor has teased its new SUV named as \u201cMG One\u201d ahead of its global debut scheduled for July 30,2021. The new SUV will be based on the MG\u2019s new SIGMA platform and will feature the latest design by the auto maker.\nAs per the teaser revealed, the SUV is featured in a vibrant orange colour with a contrasting black roof. The bonnet gets strong crease lines and a new sporty design with the MG logo at the center. In addition to this, the new SUV also gets new LED headlights, fog lights in the vertical housing with black inserts and the front bumper gets a horizontal pattern that splits the secondary grille.\nAs for the sides, the arches on the rear wheels along with the contrast black roof gives a more athletic look. Also, the alloys features a petal-shaped design and the rear gets new sleeker LED taillights that gets narrower towards the center.\nAs for now we don\u2019t have any confirmations regarding the engine specifications from the company but the new SUV is expected to offer an ICE option initially. Nevertheless, the car manufacturer mentioned that the new SUV is an all-in-one modular platform which makes it more versatile. The company has also used some terms like \u201cactive digital eco system\u201d, \u201cadvanced electric architecture\u201d, and \u201chard-core software technology\u201d indicating that the \u2018MG One\u2019 will be equipped with many latest and modern technology.\nMG Motor India is all-set to launch its new mid-size SUV by the end of this year which will be based on the MG ZS EV.

Looks weird seeing it in a photograph, I have to say.\nlol yes, the old NSA reflex stirs for me from time to time.\nThat's Myosetsuji in New York.\nI am going to guess that is Nittatsu as he was High Priest when the temple in Flushing was established.\nPlease note - Nichiren Shoshu proscribes photographing the Gohonzon so posting an image of a Gohonzon in a Nichiren Shoshu Temple will likely be considered shocking and quite possibly offensive.\nThat is an image of the Dai Gohonzon transcribed by 67th High Priest NIKKEN Shonin. It is the 1985 Mandala version, same as the one installed in Los Angeles Myohoji Temple in 1997. The Chief priest assigned to this New York Temple is Vice-President Shinga Takikawa.\nInteresting. I remember thinking it looked like the Daigohonzon when I used to go there. But then I also thought that it couldn't be because the Daigohonzon should not be copied. I don't know where those ideas came from. I was a boy back then.\nThat\u2019s actually what I had assumed at first: daigohonzon.<|endoftext|>World Sight Day is observed every year on the second Thursday of October with an aim to create attention and awareness on a wide range of issues related to blindness and vision impairment. This year, World sight Day falls on 8 October and the theme is \u2018Hope In Sight\u2019.\nWorld sight Day was first initiated during the Sight First Campaign of Lion Club International Foundation in 2000, since then it has been integrated into VISION 2020 which is jointly coordinated by International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB) and supported by the World Health Organization (WHO).\nThis day let\u2019s work together and find solutions to guarantee that each and every person across the globe has access to good sight and also spread the message of #HopeInSight.\nAs per the statistics about one billion people across the globe have a preventable vision impairment that has not been addressed. Poor eyesight or vision problems can have a long-lasting impact on all aspects of life such as daily activities relating to school, work, communities and the ability to access public services.\nThis day also stresses the need of encouraging actions to prevent blindness, as reports reveal that 80% of blindness is preventable or completely treatable and only 4 out of 5"

CNN might not be reporting, but I'm betting there are angry bloggers out there with information,\" said Jon as he pulled his laptop out.\nStephen nodded and drove around until he saw a \"Free Internet!\" sign in an IHOP window. He parked the car around back and let Jon get to work.\nIt didn't take Jon very long at all, \"None of the news sights have anything but my rss reader is going crazy.\" He found a blog of one of Sam's Canadian friends with government connections, and turned the laptop so they can both see. \"President Huckabee,\" he read from the screen, \"ordered America's border closed this evening at midnight and has stationed troops recalled from Iraq on the Mexican and Canadian borders. Huckabee claims this move is to shore up security against terrorists out side America and to help catch those who are currently trying to flee the country in fear of America's renewed security measures.\"\nThey look at the clock in unison: 12:23. Jon could see the guilt on Stephen's face: if they hadn't stayed to do the shows, they'd be free in Canada right now. \"If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have left at all,\" Jon said, even knowing his words wouldn't fix it this time.\nJon and Stephen stared at each other for a moment before Jon scrolled down the blog. \"Several people have been arrested at the border and many others turned away. The following list contains the names of people rumored to have been arrested, but there is no certain information at this point.\" Jon scanned the list for people they knew, \"Keith Olbermann, Erica Hill, fuck, this list is huge!\"\n\"And we were almost on it. We can't try and cross today,\" said Stephen quietly.\nJon fidgeted, \"I think we should get out of the state and find somewhere to hole up and wait this out.\"\nStephen nodded, \"New England or Pennsylvania?\"\nJon thought for a moment before responding, \"Pennsylvania.\" He pulled Stephen's road atlas out of the back seat and plotted them a course to Pittsburgh.\nIt was a long drive and they were both jumpy. Stephen insisted on paying with cash, but paying cash meant paying people, not machines and they could be recognized. Credit cards were even easier to track, though, so they stuck with cash, no matter how nervous it made Jon.\n\"Here,\" said Jon. Stephen took a sharp right into a slightly seedy Holiday Inn and abruptly parked the car.\n\"I'll go in and pay. You and your wonky ear will give us away,\" Jon said with a smile.\nBefore he could get out, Stephen leaned into the backseat and triumphantly produced a grey hoodie and a hundred dollars in twenties, \"This way it'll just look like you're cheating on your wife.\"\nJon rolled his eyes, but put on the hoodie anyway. The guy at the front desk showed no signs of recognition and didn't even look interested that Jon paid in cash. He took the two keycards and returned to the car.\nJon yawned and ushered Stephen into their hotel room. It was almost morning and all he wanted to do was sleep, but they were fugitives now. How crazy was that? He threw bags from their side trip to Walgreen's on the bed, \"I got three colors, any preference?\"\nStephen dug the three boxes of hair dye out of the bag and looked each over critically. \"Sandy brown,\" he decided, holding up the box. \"And you'll be cinnamon espresso. We'll do you first.\"\nJon giggled and pulled his t-shirt off over his head, \"Okay, I'm willing to be the guinea pig.\" He wandered over to the bathroom and fiddled with the bath tub's tap until the water was warm enough. He knelt down and stuck his head under the rushing water until it was completely wet.\nHe looked up to Stephen carefully mixing bottles of goop. \"It can't be that hard,\" said Stephen, \"Of course, my stylist usually does this, but\u2026\" He pulled on the plastic glove that came in the kit, and with his most evil look said, \"Ready?\"\nStephen squirted the gooey substance on Jon's head.\n\"Ack, that feels disgusting,\" said Jon, as he tired to keep his head over the tub while laughing.\n\"Stop that,\" said Stephen and with a hip check, pinned Jon between him and the tub. \"If you keep wiggling, I'm going to end up dyeing your neck cinnamon espresso, and while that might sound tasty and delicious, it smells awful.\"\n\"I saw the segment where you ate Bobby. I am not food,\" said Jon, glad that the banter between them was back. He might be able to face the end of the world as he knew it, but not if Stephen wasn't there next to him, making him laugh.\n\"Sure, Jon, you are not food. And you're done, just don't drip on anything.\"\n\"You're sure this is going to be an effective disguise?\" Jon asked, trying to remember not to touch his hair.\n\"Better than glasses,\" said Stephen.\n\"Point taken,\" replied Jon. \"It's your turn now.\"\nStephen groaned, but gamely dunked his head under the tap. Soon Stephen's head was just as covered in gooey dye as Jon's.\nJon flicked on the television. He'd always found the background buzz of the television to be calming, but today it wasn't helping much. Between the marathon drive and hair dying escapade, it was morning before the dye was washed out and Stephen fell asleep. Jon was still wide awake. He had muted the TV and turned on the captions, but it was a photo of Keith Olbermann that made him stop flipping channels.\n\"Keith Olbermann and Erica Hill arrested last night trying to cross the border into Canada in an attempt to avoid testifying in front of the House committee,\" came the confirmation across the bottom of his screen. \"Three hundred and twenty-eight others were also detained after trying to leave the United Stats last night and four thousands were turned back at various border crossings.\"\nJon lay on the bed and stared at the hotel ceiling.

Hang in there while we get technical on our watch bands. While the fit and material has remained the same, there are a few visual and structural differences to note.\nFirstly, and one of the most noteworthy structural change is the addition of a channeling system. We\u2019ve had some #watchfam feedback that the previous EH5 model lead to tearing at the tongue holes after extensive, tight wear. In order to remediate this issue, we have added a channeling system - as appears on the EH11 Tudor rubber watch band. This channeling system not only reinforces the tongue holes, but it also provides a pathway for water and sweat to run off as well as enhancing the air movement.\nOne of the most exciting changes is \u201cSwiss-Made.\u201d Again, we had a few members of the watch community note that even though straps were Swiss-Made, it was not identified on the strap. So, for all you beloved Swiss-made fans, we added it. The strap now notates \u201cSwiss-Made\u201d molded right into the rubber. Embedded at the case connection point on the underside of the strap, we even put it on both sides of the watch band.\nAnother eye-popping change that has occurred with this update is the hue has changed for some of the colors including blue, green, and red; and they are gorgeous!\nThe Blue rubber watch band received a more vibrant hue to match the Rolex dial variations like the Pepsi and the BLNR.\nThe green is more green (I know, a bit of a redundant statement). The previous green was a bit more teal to correlate to the older Rolex box whereas the new Green rubber watch band correlates better with the Hulk bezel.\nThe Red rubber took a step back from Ferrari red to associate more with a clay red - a beautiful, pure hue of what is more associated with the color red.\nThe straps that are currently available in this updated version are the Black, Blue, Green, Red and Gray. The Orange rubber will be released this summer, and the White rubber will be available in the updated version in early fall.\nFrom the Everest watch family to you, we listen. We strive to provide what the watch community requests and desires - watch guys making something for fellow watch guys. Everest has grown to where it is today thanks to the support of the watch community and fellow watch guys.Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up to date on all of our new releases and news this year.

In dollar terms, the 22-country MSCI Emerging Markets Free Index climbed 5.8% during the quarter, vs. a 3.7% gain by the MSCI World Index and a 2.5% rise by the EAFE index.\nBut during March, the EAFE index's performance outpaced the world and emerging markets indexes.\nThe strongest developed markets for the quarter were Malaysia, up 14.2%; Hong Kong, up 10.9%; and Sweden, 9.2%. Among emerging markets, Turkey was first for the quarter, up 34.4%, followed by Poland, 32.5%.<|endoftext|>Traffic delays dropped during the pandemic, and now is a time to examine how we can keep those gains.\nCOVID-19\u2032s impact on roadway traffic was deep and widespread, and it was entirely predictable given the shutdowns that occurred.\nWhat\u2019s equally clear is the lesson we can draw from our experience, particularly now, as American infrastructure needs are once again top of mind. That lesson is: The simplest path to mitigating roadway gridlock is, and has always been, reducing the demand for limited road space.\nAs a result, traffic delay dropped 60% to 70% \u2014 almost overnight \u2014 in March and April 2020. Congestion rebounded over the second half of the year, but most of the key stats \u2014 extra travel time, wasted fuel and overall cost \u2014 were half of their 2019 levels.\nTruck traffic, on the other hand, hardly dropped off at all during the year, a result of increased at-home delivery of everyday items such as hamburgers, cereal and toilet paper.\nThe annual Urban Mobility Report published by Texas A&M University has long advocated for a multistrategy approach to addressing the nation\u2019s roadway gridlock dilemma. That includes getting the best possible use out of the existing network by rapidly clearing crashes and timing traffic signals, adding capacity for cars, trucks, buses, trains and bicycle and pedestrian routes, and changing land development patterns.\nBut changing the way travelers use the transportation system by changing when, where and how they travel produces the quickest result \u2014 as long as the broadband service and employers support at-home and flexible work schedules. It makes good sense to take a bold step toward reducing congestion. That\u2019s especially true at a time when pandemic-related traffic relief is still fresh in our minds.\nTraffic congestion isn\u2019t the only impediment to travel efficiency, of course. Our greatest public health crisis in more than a century has already changed how and where we work, live and shop. Will companies be willing to make long-term commitments to work-from-home options or flexible work hours to help alleviate traffic congestion, with the added benefit of improving quality of life for their employees?\nThese changes"

Robin posed the question to me, \u201cChristine, for you, what was Christ\u2019s role in our justification?\u201d Following is my brief response.\nFor me, knowing that Jesus Christ took upon himself the penalties of my sins (whether past, present and future) and paid fully that which was due me, to me, this is the ultimate act of love and giving. Knowing the verdict has been given and the gavel dropped to declare me righteous as a result, is mind boggling, not because there is no guilt, but rather, in spite of it, Jesus paid it all. When I am reminded of this reality, it makes me want to live a life worthy of that selfless act that, in his innocence, he paid with his life by submitting his personal will to The Father so that God\u2019s will for His people could be accomplished. It also builds a desire to help relieve oppressions off others who are weighted down in guilt and shame, who may not know the grace God has in store for them.\nMy biggest take away from the Our Identity in Christ weekend along this topic is to accept the ruling of God and not allow others (or myself for that matter) to put me on trial again with any other ruling than that which God made. Nor to try and justify myself by trying to make up for the deficit of my mistakes when Jesus Christ was enough to cover me. Instead, simply confess, accept, and appreciate what\u2019s been given and then strive to do better in the future; not out of guilt, regret, shame, sorrow or anything else but rather, out of grace and gratitude.\nThank you Christine for these heart felt comments. You are so right, we have to remember not to put ourselves on trial again.<|endoftext|>This season\u2019s Carabao Cup Final has been rescheduled and will now take place on Sunday 25 April 2021, with a 4pm kick-off.\nIt is the objective of the League to stage the Final with as many supporters in attendance as possible and the decision has therefore been taken to move the Final from its original date of Sunday 28 February 2021 to later in the year.\nThe number of fans permitted will be dependent on Government guidance in place at the time and it is hoped that moving the date to later in the year will give Clubs and their fans the best opportunity to attend in person.\nThe competition is set to continue this week, with the Quarter-Finals to be played across Tuesday 22 December and Wednesday 23 December, with all four games live on Sky Sports.\nRotherham United manager Paul Warne believes his side lacked a cutting edge after losing on penalties, following a 1-1 draw in normal time against Salford City.<|endoftext|>Now that we have a basic understanding of phrasing, it is time to use your reverse interlinear to make the phrasing a little better.

A mid-model upgrade for Volvo\u2019s newish S90 premium luxury sedan.\nWhy does it matter? Volvo makes an excellent luxury sedan. Unfortunately, Canadian consumers are ignoring it (only 71 have been sold so far this year) despite its advanced features and advanced technology. The upgrades will hopefully make it more attractive to premium shoppers.\nWhen will Canada get it? The new versions with upgraded powertrains will be available later this year.\nShould you buy it? I think so. I just finished testing the 2017 S90 and it really is a fun, fast and cost effective ride. And that\u2019s with Volvo\u2019s T6 powertrain, the company\u2019s 316-horsepower variant of a super- and turbocharged 2.0-litre inline four. Imagine what the coming T8 model will be like, with the same engine mated to a hybrid electric motor for a total of 400 fuel-sipping horsepower (a base T5 with a 250-hp turbocharged four will also be available and should drag the S90\u2019s base price below $60,000). Volvo says it\u2019s also expanded the S90\u2019s rear seat legroom (not that there was a paucity before) and has made the panoramic sunroof standard equipment.<|endoftext|>Although summer claims many of the sexiest, most attention-grabbing vegetables, such as eggplants, tomatoes, peppers and zucchini, in Southern California the vegetables that thrive in winter are equally abundant and alluring. Roots, crucifers and peas may be available year-round, but winter is their time to shine. In the spirit of the many award ceremonies held in this season, here are some of my favorite early winter vegetables and producers who do an extraordinary job with them, based on notes, photos and tastings over the last 14 years.\nCeleriac, from a type of celery cultivated for its bulbous, richly scented root rather than its stalk, is a quintessential winter vegetable, at its best from late fall through early spring. Finley Farms of Santa Ynez takes the prize for its spectacular displays of freshly harvested, neatly trimmed roots, often juxtaposed with high-quality stalks of regular celery.

The air carried the unmistakable scent of the fiery spice.\nFarmers\u2019 booths nearby had loads of freshly harvested, sun-dried red chilies, ready to be ground into gochu-garu -- chili powder -- or to be aged into thick, fermented chili paste, gochujang.\nThe Aug. 27-29 Yeongyang H.O.T. Festival led to on-the-spot sales and delivery orders for chilies and related farm products totaling nearly 2 billion won ($1.7 million), organizers said.\nFrom mid-August to this week, three more such events were held in rural towns famous for their chilies: Eomseong, Goesan and Cheongyang.\nSouth Korea is in its peak season for red hot chili peppers. In late summer and early fall, the pungent spice, which provides the basis for the heat and color of many Korean dishes, arrives at the market in its best form and in abundance.\nKang Gyeong-sook, a 60-something housewife, visited Seoul Plaza to bulk purchase the peppers.\n\u201cChili is the most important spice.\u201d she said without hesitation.\nWhat she had in mind was the approaching gimjang -- the kimchi-making season in early winter, when families prepare a large quantity of the pickled cabbage dish for consumption throughout the year.\n\u201cDuring the gimjang season, chili prices go up,\u201d Kang\u2019s friend chimed in. They were each looking to buy at least 12 kilograms of dried chilies, or 20 geun in the traditional Korean unit of weight.\nKorea\u2019s per-capita chili consumption stood at around 3 kilograms in 2017, down from 3.7 kilograms in 2013. That is about 8 grams of chilies per day. It is the most consumed vegetable here.\nThe small, fiery fruit is now such an integral part of Korean cuisine that even toddlers have their daily fix of kimchi -- though it could be a milder version -- even before they learn how to use chopsticks.\nHowever, it was only in the postwar era that Koreans began to develop such a deep fondness for the spice.\nChilies are believed to have first arrived here in the 16th century and were widely cultivated in the 18th century. But until the 1950s, they did not have such a big presence on Korean dining tables.\nAccording to Ahn Jung-youn, a researcher at the National Folk Museum of Korea, the stress of postwar society sparked the popularity of chilies.\n\u201cThe Korean War and the years that followed were no doubt a time of extreme difficulties. \u2026 There is a link between a society\u2019s stress level and the yearning for spicy food,\u201d she said.\nAs the nation recovered from the war and rebuilt its economy at an unprecedented speed,"

Existing infrastructure is somewhat complex and not-easy-to-manage because it has many components such as pods, node_port, load_balancers, instances, etc. Furthermore, some components are the legacy of the previous service, Dorothy, and dApps, which adds the infrastructure\u2019s complexity. The infrastructure demands our attention more and more. So we need to do something to calm down the infrastructure. Since we have successfully started the Orbit testing, we have decided to update the infrastructure to increase management efficiency. The update is also imperative not only for the management but for the Orbit service.\nNo developer likes infrastructure updates because it requests extra-care, hard work, and a long time. We expect the completion date will be the end of March.\nWe have started a parameter optimization for crypto assets. Finding the right parameter is one of the key success factors. The same model could show a very different result with different parameter settings. It is often said that parameter optimization is black magic because there is no standardized rule yet, and the secret recipe is not open to the public.\nOur preference for optimization is bayesian parameter search. It is not perfect, but it saves time and gives us an acceptable result.

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is closely related to the over expression of many cancers, and is therefore a promising target for tumor immunotherapy. To search for novel IDO1-targeting therapeutic agents, 22 icotinib-linked 1,2,3-triazole derivatives were prepared and evaluated for their inhibitory activity against IDO1. The structures of the prepared compounds were confirmed with1H NMR, 13C NMR and HR MS. IDO1 inhibitory activity assay results indicated that 10 of those compounds showed remarkable inhibitory activity against IDO1, among which compound a17 was the most potent with IC50value of 0.37 \u03bcM. The binding model between the prepared compounds and IDO1 was studied with molecular modeling study. The current study suggested that icotinib-1,2,3-triazole derivatives could be used as potential inhibitors that preferentially bind to the ferrous form of IDO1 through the formation of coordinate bond with the haem iron.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\nTumor immunotherapy is an emerging field in tumor treatment. Studies show that indoleamine 2,3dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is the initial and rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the metabolism of tryptophan along the kynurenine pathway outside the human liver (Chen et al., 2019), and plays an important role in regulating the body's innate and adaptive immunity by catalyzing tryptophan metabolism (Takikawa et al., 1986;Takikawa, 2005). In the tumor microenvironment, tumor cells can induce IDO1 over expression, which causes the depletion of local tryptophan and the accumulation of metabolites such as kynurenine, thereby activating GCN2 and AHR signaling pathways, inhibiting T cell proliferation, and inducing apoptosis (Muller et al., 2005). Additionally, the original T cells are stimulated to differentiate into regulatory T cells, thus mediating tumor immune escape (Efimov et al., 2011). Over expression of IDO1 has been found in a variety of malignant tumors, such as ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. Therefore, IDO1 inhibitors once attracted considerable attention as potential agents for cancer treatment.\nSeveral candidates are currently undergoing clinical trials, but none of these has been approved so far, suggesting that the identification of potent and clinically useful IDO1 inhibitors is an open challenge. For example, epacadostat ( Figure 1, 1, INCB024360) (Yue et al., 2017), indoximod ( Figure 1, 2, 1-methyl-D-tryptophan) (Soliman et al., 2009), navoximod ( Figure 1, 3, NLG-919) (Kumar et al., 2019), EOS-200271 (Figure 1, 4, PF-06840003) (Crosignani et al., 2017), and BMS-986205 ( Figure 1, 5) have been are currently being tested in human clinical trials. Epacadostat, developed by Incyte, is the first highly effective and highly selective oral IDO1 inhibitor (Morgan et al., 2008;Lin et al., 2016;Lewis-Ballester et al., 2017;Yue et al., 2017). It can effectively restore the anti-tumor immune response in human Hela cells treated with IFN-g. Via reversing tumor-associated immunosuppression, it can effectively suppress kynurenineproduction. Epacadostat also increases IFN-g production, promotes the growth of natural killer (NK) and T cells, and reduces the number of converted regulatory T cells (Tregs) (Dounay et al., 2015). Based on the promising results in Phase 1/2 studies, epacadostat proceeded to a Phase 3 trial (ECHO-301) in combination with pembroluzimab in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Recent results coming from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of ECHO-301 have shown no indication that epacadostat provides an increased benefit compared to pembrolizumab alone, questioning the effectiveness of IDO1 inhibitors. This failure led to the interruption of other Phase III trials and the reconsideration of whether some elements had been neglected in the landscape of IDO1 inhibitors (Serafini et al., 2020). Study showed that the key group playing the active role in the epacadostat molecule was the oxadiazole structure. The epacadostat molecule entered the heme pocket of the IDO1, and the oxadiazole structure located directly above the Fe ion in the heme and then interacted with it. Based on this, a new type of IDO1 inhibitor which linked urea groups to the oxadiazole structure was developed (Wu et al., 2017;Song et al., 2020) (Figure 1, 6) and the compounds showed submicromolar level of IC 50 against IDO1.\nEncouraged by these results, we decided to study the bioactivity of compounds bearing different 1,2,3-triazole groups. At first, icotinib was chosen as the starting point. This compound has been clinically used in China for the treatment of NSCLC (Yang et al., 2017;Liang et al., 2018;Zhang et al., 2018). We envisioned that introducing 1,2,3-triazole structure into the molecule via conventional click reaction would give compounds with additional benefit by the 1,2,3-triazole group, and this twin drug approach will combine the advantages of both EGFR-TKI and IDO1 inhibitors. Herein, we wish to present our preliminary results on the preparation of the 1,2,3-triazole derivatives and their in vitro inhibitory activity against IDO1.\n\nCHEMISTRY\nThe synthetic strategy for the preparation of the target compounds is illustrated in Figure 2. Copper(I)-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition between icotinib and different azido compounds afforded the target compounds a1-a22. The reaction conditions of these steps were convenient and easy to control. The structures of some key intermediates and all target compounds were confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance and high-resolution mass spectrometry experiments.\n\nMaterials and Chemistry\nIcotinib-1,2,3-triazole derivatives were in-house synthesized. Icotinib and Aryl-azido compounds were purchased from Acros Organics (Morris Plains, NJ, USA). All reagents and solvents obtained from commercially available source were used without further treatment. 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR spectra were acquired in DMSO-d 6 or CDCl 3 solution with a Bruker 600 spectrometer. Chemical shifts (d) were given in parts per million with tetramethylsilane as internal reference and"

TIA.\nYou can get on it by Hokkaido rail pass without extra charge.\nWhat track # at the Sapporo station do I need to go to ride the Furano Lavender Express? I tried to search on Hyperdia but could not find any of the Crystal Express fleets (i.e. Crystal Express, North Rainbow Express and Niseko Express). I could only see results for Ltd Exp Lilac 3 and no departure time of 752am.\nFinally, how much is the round trip fare (Sapporo to Furano, vise versa) for the Furano Lavender Express? I want to know because I\u2019m trying to figure out if the 7-day JR Pass will pay off for my planned trip.\nThanks in advance for your help Takeshi!\nI could find Furano Lavender Express on Hyperdia. But it sometimes does not show seasonal train. Please check the link below to find the operation dates.\nThe one way fare is 4,810 yen for base fare and seat fee.\nThank you for your quick reply. This means I just need to watch out for the Crystal Express fleet of trains and board when one of it comes at the Sapporo JR train station correct? Can I make seat reservation for the Lavender Express?\nAlso, I was reading the Furano-Biei Norokko train timetable. Is my understanding correct that the 1st train to leave Furano for Biei is Norokko train #2 at 1153am arriving at Biei 1255pm? Then to return to Furano from Biei, I need to take the Norokko train #3 or #5?\nThanks again Takeshi-san!\nFurano Lavender Express may be operated by ordinary fleet. So don\u2019t look for only Crystal Express fleet. Check the signage on the train and at the platform to make sure it\u2019s Lavender Express.\nReservation is highly recommended to take this train. It\u2019s always busy. Once you get Japan, try to book it at most of JR stations ASAP.\nThe following link shows you the timetable of Norokko train easily.\nThank you Takeshi-san. It seems the fare is a bit cheaper too even for a green car seat in the Ltd Exp Lilac trains from Sapporo to Furano via Takikawa. I guess the only advantage of using the Lavender Express is that there are no stop overs. I plan to get a 7day JR Pass as I will also be going to Kanto after my Sapporo trip. I will reserve either for the Lavender Express or the Ltd Exp Lilac train when I get to CTS aiport.\nSorry Takeshi-san but I have additional questions.\n1) Would you have the train schedule and fare table for the other local trains within the Furano-Biei area? Since the Norokko train has a specific schedule, I wanted to know what are my other train options if I miss the Norokko train.\n2) How much is the Norokko fare from Furano to Biei. I read somewhere that it is 950yen. Is this correct?\nI appreciate all your help Takeshi-san!\n2) Please use hyperdia to find the base fare.\nIf you reserve a seat, seat fee is 520 yen on top of base fare.\nAnd also you will find \u201cFurano Biei Rail Ticekt\u201d in the link below. There are some PDF file and it shows you the bus schedule.\nNo worries, Aaron.\nI will travel to Furano and Biei at the end of June.\nDo you know when the JR Hokkaido Twinkle Bus starts this year? How frequent the Twinkle bus is everyday?\nNo worries, Ellen.\nNext Next post: Furano Biei Norokko train, Easy rail trip around Furano area for everyone.<|endoftext|>When you underwent your breast augmentation procedure, you may never have given thought to the possibility of needing to remove your implants down the road. However, due to a few different conditions and problems, some women do make the decision to remove their breast implants. This procedure is often called an explant. Some follow up removal with a new augmentation, while others maintain their natural breasts. The choice is your personal decision, and Dr. Marc Polecritti at The Julian Institute of Plastic Surgery is here to help you make a fully informed decision and provide expert breast implant removal services.\nWhy Remove Your Implants?\nEvery year, about 40,000 women make the decision to undergo breast implant removal surgery, and you may be contemplating adding your name to that list. There are many different factors that might lead you to consider breast implant removal. Perhaps you received your implants from a different plastic surgeon and you are unhappy with the quality of your results. It\u2019s also possible that you have changed your priorities and now wish to have bigger or smaller implants than you originally received. Life changes, which is why implants sometimes need to change, too!\nIn some cases, women experience health complications that can lead to the need for implant removal. Capsular contracture, for example, develops when internal scar tissue forms a tight capsule around the breast implant and contracts, forcing the breast to feel painful and stiff. This is not a common problem, as it affects only five percent of women with implants, but it\u2019s important to recognize the symptoms nonetheless. Other potential implant issues include shifting, wrinkling, and rupturing. There are some women who are medically required to remove their implants in order to receive treatment for breast cancer.\nWhat Should You Expect From Breast Implant Removal?\nDr. Polecritti is proud to be double board certified with extensive training and experience regarding breast implants and explants. You can trust that your breast implant removal procedure with Dr. Polecritti will be a smooth, safe, and successful process. You\u2019ll receive anesthesia so that Dr. Polecritti can remove the scar tissue and your implants through the same incision used during augmentation surgery. He utilizes the En Bloc procedure that prevents any contamination of the capsule contents within the body.\nYou may also opt for a breast lift with your implant removal surgery, since your breasts most likely stretched and sagged over time. Dr. Polecritti can also replace your implants with newer, updated implants that are larger or smaller than your previous set.

Can you comment on the itinerary and if I should use JR pass or local bus?\nI recommend you to use Hokkaido Rail Pass Flex 4 days for Noboribetsu to Sapporo, day trip to Furano/Biei, day trip to Otaru and Sapporo to Hakodate.\nI recommend you to take a bus as you think in Hokkaido, and take a domestic flight from Hakodate to Tokyo. You may use a subway pass in Tokyo and take a bus to get Narita.\nDear Takeshi, me & my husband are going to Hokkaido in mid-January 2019. Since it\u2019s winter and we have no experience in driving on snow, we decided to just go around using public transport. Your articles have helped me lots in planning my trip. However, I\u2019m not sure if JR Hokkaido pass pay out for the whole trip. This is my tentative itinerary, i hope you do not mind to check on my itinerary and advise me on the type of pass/tickets that suit my trip best (JR pass / S kippu, etc). It will be 7 full days & 7 nights trip as I will be arrived at new-chitose airport at 8.05 am.\nIs the itinerary on D3 \u2013 D4 (sapporo furano / biei route)possible? or too tiring? It seems to be a bit difficult (so far I only found Biei View Bus Tour) to get sightseeing tour in the area during winter. I appreciate so much if you could give me some advice on the itinerary.\nIf you are okay with taking a train between Sapporo and Biei via Asahikawa, between Furano and Sapporo, you may use Hokkaido Rail Pass 7 days for the last or the first 7 days. You will pay a regular fare for New Chitose \u2013 Sapporo on day 1 or day 8. You can find all train timetables in the link below except the segment between Furano and Takikawa.\nYour itinerary looks okay. It\u2019s not too much. It\u2019s feasible.\nHi Chen, I hope you don\u2019t mind me borrowing your thread to ask some questions as we have very similar itinerary and dilemma but I would be traveling 8D7N in late February 2019 instead.\nHi Takeshi, I have opted to plan my itinerary based on the Hokkaido 5 Day bus pass instead of Hokkaido JR Pass. Based on the calculations, I would be able to save roughly \u00a512,000 on transportation (for 2 pax) if I were to go with the bus pass. However, I am still on the fence about using the buses in winter as there had been several comments that the bus schedules during winter time is very likely to be affected due to bad weather and road conditions.\nBased on your experience, how often do the buses get affected during winter? Will it be okay to go with the buses, or should I spend an extra few for the Hokkaido JR pass, to ensure i get to all my planned destinations.\nActually I always try to avoid using a bus because I get motion sickness easily on the bus. So I don\u2019t have so much experience. And it\u2019s hard to say \u201cHow often\u201d the bus delay.\nAs per the reviews among local tourists, it is very usual that bus runs behind the schedule. They said that it runs and lucky because it\u2019s better than cancel. Train is more reliable than bus.\nThis is not based on my experience. I cannot guarantee these reviews. You may be okay or may be not. It depends on the nature and nobody can say that.\nIf I were you, I go for rail pass. But I like train much much more than bus in any seasons. The choice is yours.\nMy friend and I are flying from Singapore to sapporo arriving 22 Dec 2018 and leaving 28 December 2018. We are not sure during Winter what is the best things to do, we want to experience the winter in Japan hence we are visiting this period.We prefer to use public transport and our interest are in beautiful scenery and nature and good food and onsen stays. Is Hokkaido Rail Pass a good way to travel during our trip?\nOur itinerary is as below, and we are not sure whether it is workable.\n22 Dec Arrive at Chitose airport at 8 pm.JR Rapid train to Sapporo.\nWe are not sure what to see in Sapporo., therefore the itinerary is very skeleton. Hope you can help us.\nIf you give up Hakodate and visit Lake Toya and/or Noboribetsu, you can add other trip to get the worth of Hokkaido Rail Pass, such as trip to Furano.\nI visited Biei and Furano in my trip before visiting Noboribetsu. And also as I did, you can visit Lake Toya and Noboribetsu in one day.\nIf i were to visit Lake Toya and Noboribetsu, Furano and Biei in one day (is it possible)? Also thinking of visiting Asahiyama Zoo. Could you please advise do i need a Hokkaido Pass.\nDo you mean that you will spend one day only to visit four places, Noboribetsu, Lake Toya, Furano and Biei? Or do you mean spend one day each for Furano and Biei, Noboribetsu and Lake Toya? If you intend to spend one day each (total 2 days), it\u2019s possible. But one day is not enough to visit four places. If you go to Asahiyama zoo, you may combine with Furano and Biei. Hokkaido pass 3 days is recommended for these trips.\nThank you for your reply. Can we take the Donan bus or Chuo bus from Sapporo Station to Noboribetsu, in case the bus is suspended due to the weather.\nIf you take a bus to Noboribetsu, you have to pay a regular fare and you cannot get the worth of Hokkaido Rail Pass. Train is more stable than bus in snowy condition.\nMy husband and I are flying to sapporo arriving 30 Nov 2018 and leaving 8 December 2018. We know that this period is not the best time to visit hokkaido but have no choice due to annual leave restriction. Your article is so interesting and hope you can verify my itinerary if it is doable.This is our first visit to Japan and we prefer to use public transport. Our interest are in beautiful scenery and nature and good food and onsen stays.\n30 Nov Arrive at Chitose airport at 8 am.JR Rapid train to Sapporo.\nHope we can reach these places with either train or public bus and sufficient time allocated. Your comments is much appreciated.\nYour itinerary looks good. You will have a chance to see snow, especially in Sounkyo. It will be winter condition. Please prepare warm clothing and snow boots.\nYou may use Hokkaido Rail Pass 7 days for December 1 to 7.\nYou may add a regular fare ticket for arrival and departure days. You can find the fare in the post of Hokkaido Rail Pass at the link above.<|endoftext|>Chris has"

If you're handed a sticky laminated menu,  or a coffee stained paper menu,  that's not a sign of the kitchen being messy. It's a good indicator of the front of house staff not doing the side work that is easy to forget when busy. Bathrooms get dirty. \n\n They might be really busy. \n\nThe server might forget to give you water. Just ask nice.  The shortcomings of front of house staff can be as far and wide as the back of house that over dressed your salad and burnt your steak. \n\nIn any case, a dirty menu isn't necessarily an indicator the place as a whole is bad,  just that maybe one menu or a couple didn't get wiped. If they are a shitty FOH staff you'll probably see it when you walk in,  the floors are sticky or dirty,  unbussed tables are about with chairs not pushed in,  tables not sanitized,  spotty wares  (big red flag for me)... those places do exist. \n\nAnother point,  menus are subtle,  a minor thing (obviously).

Barbara worked for a short time with the Bell Telephone Company and soon met the man she would marry, Reid Hansen. The couple celebrated their 66th wedding anniversary earlier this year.\nDuring her life, Barbara was devoted to her family and friends. She was an avid reader and loved her travels with Reid and friends to Asia, Europe, nearly every state, and many cruises. Some of her fondest years were the eleven spent at Camp Parsons, a Boy Scout camp on Hood Canal where Reid and her son and daughter worked as staff members. Barbara also worked part-time in several Bellevue Public Schools as a library aide.\nBarbara and Reid spent the 30 plus years of retirement at the family home on Bainbridge Island that Reid grew up in. She treasured the many friends and neighbors in their community, always offering a smile and time to chat. Her book club gatherings in later years were a highlight. She devoted many volunteer hours at the Bainbridge Island Historical Museum, Bainbridge Senior Center, and the Seattle Children\u2019s Bainbridge Bargain Boutique. She loved to play cards, particularly pinochle, and do crossword puzzles.\nBarbara was preceded in death by her parents, sister Dorothy Jean, and son Michael Reid. She is survived by her husband Reid, son Jeffrey (Donna), and daughter Julie (Steve). Pictures of her grandchildren and great-grandchildren adorn many walls and appliances in the home as they were always a delight to visit and caress. Grandchildren include Amy Gendron-Hansen, Eric Hansen, Nicholas Hayes, Ryan Hayes and Brandon Hayes. Her great-grandchildren are Rowan, Coraline, and Gavin Gendron-Hansen.\nA gathering to celebrate Barbara\u2019s life will take place at the family home at a later date. Memorial contributions may be made with any of the volunteer sites Barbara enjoyed along with Project Ethiopia.<|endoftext|>Dr Mahesh Chander narrates his unique experience from participating in the IFOAM Organic Leadership Course Master Class-2017, which was the follow-up of the Organic Leadership Course he attended in 2012.\nFederation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM), initiated Organic Leadership Course (OLC) in 2012. I was one among the 15 participants selected for the first OLC-South Asia Course of 10 month duration, with online and two residential modules of 10 days (Near Mumbai, Maharashtra, April, 2012) and 7 days (http://www.ifoam.bio/en/olcsouth-asia-2012 ) in Bangalore (November, 2012). As a part of this training, each one of us created Development Plans (DPs) to be pursued after completion of the course.\nFrom the 60 applications they received, 24 participants from 18 countries were selected for a 6 days training at Goesan, South Korea, during 24-29 April, 2017. Well in advance, the IFOAM Academy published a document describing the profile of the course participants, indicating their achievements in context of their DPs (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0TX5SvS4lMRVUx3ZkVLaUpod2s/view. Also, well before the start of the current course, the programme schedule was mailed to all the participants (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0TX5SvS4lMRblN1cDF5Vmd6ZXM/view.\nThe Honorable Deputy Governor of the Goesan province, addressed the participants, who were introduced to him by the course Director. The inauguration activity was crisp and finished as per schedule within 30 minutes.\nWell planned technical sessions were mostly group exercises with presentation by the course participants, wherein, presentation methods like world caf\u00e9, open space, fish bowl, cards, charts, etc., were used. These sessions were interactive and participatory, enabling everyone to contribute to the discussions, thus making the methodology used, a good, participatory experience.\nproduce products believing human and nature as well as the urban and rural areas are connected in the string of life. The consumers buy the products, relating to this thought of the producers. It is a good concept worth replicating in other developing countries, though it has its own set of issues. We also visited an organic farm by name 10 Farmers, which was diverse in its produce and had its own retail store to sell its farm produce.\nThe course participants continue to send their free and frank feedback on the course, which is highly appreciative. The constructive criticism of the course (Box 1), in fact, may be used by the IFOAM Academy to improve this course in the future. Many participants including myself felt the duration of the course could have been a little longer, maybe 10 days. The course director assured that the feedback will be analyzed and a general reflection on this course would be shared in coming days. The participants were also interested to have more interactions with organic farmers there and listen to their practical experiences to contrast the experiences with the farmers back home. Maybe the time constraint did not allow this, nevertheless, many of us felt the need for it.\nMy expectation was, as master class alumni, we should have come up with at least an organic leadership output that can be country/region specific, based on the organic leadership course, our DPs and experiences \u2013 for scaling up. For example, it could be an organic leadership training design that would be appropriate for the agriculture policy makers or for organic practitioners and/or for agricultural extension workers. In this way, there will be a training guide developed by a pool of experts on how to train future organic leaders in their respective areas. It will also be a good attachment for proposal on organic training funding. I hope this will be taken into consideration as one idea on future master class.\nProgram/ workshop topics may be reconsidered, clear statement before outset or at start of class on expectations and outcomes from the course \u2013 in collaboration with participants, excursions built in earlier in the program. These were really excellent and well chosen (Hansalim, 10 Farmers etc), and they gave great insight into organic agriculture, direct selling and consumer organization. Development Plan tactic \u2013 further development plan for each participant perhaps? Longer course could be considered, for various reasons (including jetlag?)as we took time to start interacting as a group, group exercises / icebreakers at the start, to develop trust and ideas between members, we went immediately into output mode. Topic suggestions: Participate in discussions about the future of organic agriculture e.g., Vision development or envision, the future of organic; fuller examination of Organic 3.0 and concepts and how and what to implement; suggestions on how to improve organic agriculture and take-up in each Participant\u2019s local context; selecting success stories/ identifying elements that might work in the participants\u2019 local context, and replicating and scaling organic agriculture success stories.\nWhile we are slowly receiving everyone\u2019s feedback, do we also try and find a way \u2013 collectively (but virtually), to envision and create a \u201cwhere do we go from here\u201d plan? I remember we didn\u2019t quite formulate one or didn\u2019t reach a consensus. That, or we just let it be? \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019ve been going over my notes and the common theme has been: local, empowerment, communicating to the grassroots/farmers/smallholders, cultural shifts and a more enabling environment versus regulation. Let me know what everyone thinks, and if you all want to move this forward with a commitment to a project/initiative or if we just let it be.\nI enjoyed OLC a lot; agree with most of your comments. Personally, I think it was a pity we did not have more time to present success stories of our work in more detail. People can always share the best topics they are really into, frontal talks maybe old-fashioned but input can be very good.\nI would have liked to discuss and examine more of the Organic 3 as mentioned by Tracy and Ailbhe. This will be on another occasion and probably at Organic World Congress 2017 in India. I agree with Ailbhe, that we should have discussed on how to improve organic agriculture in each participant\u2019s local context. As Mahesh said, the value chain and group / cooperative farming approach being done by Hansalim, is an excellent model to follow in our countries. Finally, David\u2019s idea for the creation of an OLC Alumni Network is a priority to take advantage of international expertise in the organic field. From my part, I suggest the creation of a platform reserved for distance learning courses with discussion forums. These courses could deal with very specific aspects such as composting, organic intensification, organic innovations, etc.\nThe Course Director responded to the feed- back and gave his equally frank reflection on the course (Box2).\nWhile applying to the course, the prospective participants were asked to submit a motivation letter, as to why they want to participate in this course? On completion of the course, in their feedback, they have mentioned whether their expectations from the course were met or not. The course participants took a keen interest in giving their constructive feedback with an intent to see similar programmes being organized in a better way.\nThe programme focused on technical content, presentations, and learning and sharing from the experiences of diverse set of participants in a participatory mode. It\u2019s a good practice worth replicating in training programmes that are organized. The inaugural session was so brief and took only 30 minutes, which helped by providing adequate time for other more relevant sessions.\nProfessional way of handling the programme, the logistics, catering, accommodation, transport etc., were outstanding. These lessons could be useful to make training programmes organized by us more impactful.\nThere were a lot of positive outcomes, especially the opportunity to"

The GranTurismo MC Stradale coupe can appeal to the track types while comfortably seating up to four, providing optimum versatility.\nTypically when an exotic sports car claims to have four seats the rear seats are barely large enough to store a bag of golf clubs or a small child. The Maserati GranTurismo Stradale\u2019s rear seating is just as luxurious as the front options\u2013coated in leather and Alcantara and finished with beautiful hand stitching. Two adults can ride with ample leg and headspace, making this a rarity indeed.\nThe rear of the cabin also boasts a center armrest, reading lights and cup holders. While Rolls Royce is not likely alarmed, it is a step-up from cramped predecessors.\nUnder the hood is a Maserati 4.7-liter V8 engine.\nA carbon fiber bonnet helps to reduce the added weight of the additional seating.\nThe four-seater version hits the 0-60 mile per hour mark in 4.5 seconds, which is the same as the two-seater.\nShockingly, the four-seater Stradale is actually two miles per hour faster at top speed.\nIt features dedicated Race mode, Automatic and Sport mode.\nBrembo carbon ceramic brakes provide a fast and smooth stop.\nJust 20 units of the 2014 Maserati GranTurismo MC Stradale will be available for New Zealand and Australia. The price is about average for its class at $345,000 plus delivery and dealer fees. It will be interesting to see if other leading luxury auto brands will create a comparable ride with the looks of a performance car and the space of a sedan.<|endoftext|>before_install:\n    # init xvfb\n    # http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/gui-and-headless-browsers/\n    - \"export DISPLAY=:99.0 && sh -e /etc/init.d/xvfb start\"\nbranches:\n    only:\n    - alpha\n    - beta\n    - cron\n    - docker.base\n    - docker.latest\n    - master\n    - publish\n    - task\nenv:\n    global:\n    # this value is auto-created by shTravisCryptoAesEncryptYml\n    - secure: 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 # CRYPTO_AES_KEY\n    # this value is auto-created by shTravisCryptoAesEncryptYml\n\nlanguage:\n    - node_js\nnode_js:\n    - 6\n    # - node\nscript:\n    - npm run build-ci\nservices:\n    - docker\n# http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/workers/container-based-infrastructure\nsudo:\n    false<|endoftext|>Posted on 11.03.2019 by Ammiel L.\nPosted on 11.03.2019 by Valentine D.\nPosted on 11.03.2019 by Caleb G.\nMaterial: % organic ringspun combed cotton.

In this study, we sought to determine the predictive value of maternal serum level of procalcitonin (PCT) in the early diagnosis of chorioamnionitis in women with preterm PROM (PPROM). Methods: In this prospective cohort study, owing to limited financial resources, 48 patients with PPROM in the Kosar Ward of Motahari Hospital in Urmia, Iran were selected to comprise the sample. Inclusion criteria wereamniotic fluid leak, positive ferning and nitrazine tests, gestational age 28-33 weeks, and lack of fetal tachycardia. Exclusion criteria were chronic and congenital heart disease and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Data were analyzed using SPSS v. 19 software; descriptive statistics, independent t-tests, and the Pearson test were also performed. Results: We studied 48 pregnant women and their neonates. Approximately 40% of women had chorioamnionitis; approximately 60% of women did not have chorioamnionitis. Moreover, approximately 69% of the neonates had a 5-minute Apgar score \u22657. A significant correlation was observed between women who had histopathology confirmed chorioamnionitis and neonate hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit (P<0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of PCT inflammatory indices were 100%, 79%, 57.5%, and 100%, respectively, for the histopathologic diagnosis of chorioamnionitis. Conclusion: In pregnant women, we found a significant correlation between PCT index at delivery and histopathologic chorioamnionitis.<|endoftext|>The vampire treatment is not a post-Halloween inspired story, but the endearing nickname for an innovative new hair growth therapy also known as PRP (platelet-rich plasma). The fast gain in popularity of this treatment comes from its well-diversified benefits including efficacy, safety and cost.\nAs the name suggests, PRP is plasma, (a component of the blood,) that has been enriched for platelets. Simply, a small amount of blood (only a fraction of what would be drawn for a blood donation for example) is collected from the patient. That sample is then concentrated for its platelets which contain healing properties and an abundance of growth factors (1). Lastly, the platelets are activated and injected at the site of desired hair growth.\nPRP therapy has diverse applications in hair treatment with an improvement in hair growth and thickness observed in those diagnosed with the immune condition alopecia areata (2,3), the more prevalent pattern baldness (4\u20138) and to increase the success of hair transplant surgery (9).\nOne of the main advantages of PRP is that the patient\u2019s own blood is drawn for treatment. Therefore when executed properly by your haircare professional, opportunities for transmission of infectious disease and reported side-effects are minimal (10). Likewise without the use of specialized drugs, the costs remain low comparatively.\nCurrently the technology is still new but does have FDA approval for specific uses. Use of PRP for haircare would be considered \u201coff label,\u201d however with all of its advantages and some further investigations into methods, PRP may soon become a popular option in haircare.

Adopted at three years old in 1984 by loving parents, Kara was mostly disinterested in finding her birth family. But when Kara became a mother and her daughter approached the same age as when she was abandoned, Kara couldn\u2019t understand why her mother would give her up. Kara began an intense search to find her parents.\nKara researched adoptee forums on Facebook, adoptee rights organizations, and online genealogy platforms. She took DNA tests through Family Tree DNA, then uploaded the results to MyHeritage. Then the waiting began.\nA few years later, Kara learned she had been matched with a relative\u2014her nephew, or the grandson of her biological father. However, Kara was met with resistance to reaching her father by her nephew\u2019s mother and aunts (her presumed half-sisters), and Kara filed a lawsuit which resulted in a court-ordered paternity test.\nKara briefly met her father on his apartment doorstep, who brushed her aside and has had no further contact. The DNA test did confirm, however, that he was Kara\u2019s biological father.\nThe lawsuit, if ruled in favor of Kara, would reward Kara with legal recognition as her Korean father\u2019s daughter, officially being entered into his family registry. It\u2019s the first of its kind, and could set a new precedent for information gained from DNA tests.\nIrish siblings Helen Ward and David McBride didn\u2019t know they were siblings\u2014even though they had the same parents.\nIn 1962, David was found in a tartan bag in a car on the outskirts of Belfast city. In 1968 Helen was abandoned and found, also in a tartan bag, on the other side of the Irish border, in Dundalk.\nDavid and Helen have spent their lives searching for biological family, and that\u2019s where DNA testing came in. They both took DNA tests and uploaded them to the database, hoping to find blood relatives.

The program is designed to empower family physicians with new ways to promote physical activity, nutrition, and emotional well-being for the entire family. The endeavor will be administered by Americans In Motion (AIM), an AAFP initiative that improves the health of all Americans through multifaceted fitness programs.\n\"In order to combat childhood obesity effectively, we need to target not just the children, but the entire family,\" said Jim King, M.D., president of the AAFP. \"Children learn by example, and a household that, as a unit, makes sure to include regular exercise and balanced diets in its day-to-day life is much more likely to have children who are happy and healthy.\"\nThe partnership will produce and distribute an educational DVD and children's book, for use in physician waiting rooms, that encourages patients to talk with family physicians about fitness and to work together to develop a plan that enables sustained healthy lifestyle choices among family members. The educational materials, due to be distributed in the spring and summer of 2009 to more than 36,600 family physicians and 457 family medicine residency training programs, will be available in both English and Spanish. The materials will discuss fitness for the family, with a special emphasis on ways to maintain fitness for children through a balance of physical activity, nutrition, and emotional well-being.\n\"The family physician can help combat the growing threat of childhood obesity, by providing families with much-needed information from a trusted source,\" said Sibyl Jacobson, president of MetLife Foundation. \"MetLife Foundation is pleased to help support this program, which offers information about the importance of making smart decisions that can result in longer, healthier lives.\"\nToday's children may have a shorter life expectancy than their parents because of obesity-related illnesses. Almost 60 percent of Americans do not get sufficient daily exercise, and almost 65 percent of Americans are overweight or obese. The family physician conducts 210 million patient visits each year, and is in a strong position to positively influence the fitness habits of their patients, helping to fight childhood obesity on a national scale.\nMetLife Foundation was established by MetLife in 1976 to carry on its longstanding tradition of corporate contributions and community involvement. Grants support health, education, civic and cultural programs. For more information about the Foundation, visit http://www.metlife.org.<|endoftext|>Stop The Press. Let readers understand the true(non- mainstream media) dynamic at play. PM Justin Trudeau informs Canadian that our nation has a serious problem of an aging demographic and workforce.\nHis pit-bull from Somalia, Immigration Minister MP Ahmed Hussen, tells Canada we must maintain the highest immigration quotas per-capita in the western world, in order to off-set a lack of Canadian workers. Over 90% of these imports come from Hussen\u2019s chosen African, Islamic and Third World nations. These are Hussen\u2019s people, and this is who he chooses to import\u2013even the illegal ones.\nWhat government or media never speak of is the fact that our current and previous governments could have set up programs to motivate Canadians to have more children in lieu of a problem that has been understood for DECADES. They did no such thing.\nWhat was set up was the most open, no-limits, FULL-TERM permissible fetus destruction. The man who created this was Pierre Trudeau. It was he who placed a European refugee in charge of the program\u2013a man named Dr. Henry Morgantaler.\nThis sketchy fellow claimed to have personally performed 5000 abortions. At the time, his behaviour was against the law. Memories of Trudeau Dynasty? Of course\u2013 both father and son Justin share a tendency for setting aside domestic law to accomplish their ideological goals.\nHear ye, hear ye\u2013Justin Trudeau is \u201csupportive\u201d of abortion. Talk about down-playing the circumstances.!Trudeau is not \u201csupportive\u201d of fetus destruction\u2013he DEMANDS it. Upon seizing control of Canada in 2015, our PM instructed his Liberal Cabinet and Caucus they MUST vote pro-abortion under all circumstances\u2013a far cry from the benign manner in which the source article describes Trudeau\u2019s attitude.\nWhat else does media eschew? How about the fact that a Trudeau founded mass fetus destruction in Canada, while a current Trudeau family member tells his party they must support the destruction of 100,000 fetuses each year.\nNow, we flip to"

If you want food grown in healthy, pesticide-free soil by farmers who care passionately about the health of their family, friends and neighbors, buy your food from local organic farms.\nA growing number of young farmers are planting seeds, tending the soil and selling their organic produce locally. To learn more about what has inspired younger farmers to join this movement and how we can support them, I contacted the owners of five small farms and asked to spend some time working and talking with them.\nWhen I arrived at Jack\u2019s two-acre farm, he pointed to a row of carrot seedlings and suggested we hand-weed the row as we talked. It was a cool morning with the threat of rain.\nJack grew up in the Imperial Valley, a fourth-generation farmer. But he did not stay in the Imperial Valley to grow lettuce and onions with his dad and uncles. He wanted to be near the ocean and good surf, so he came to UCSB to get a degree in business economics. Then he took a job with the financial management firm Smith Barney.\nRealizing he had no passion for what he was doing, he left Smith Barney after two years. \u201cMark and Laurie Constable of Avalon Flowers were in the process of converting from growing cut flowers to growing organic vegetables and starting a CSA,\u201d Jack says. \u201cI offered to help write a business plan and ended up working for them full time during the transition.\u201d After that he worked for a landscape gardener, until a friend told him about a plot of land available in Goleta. Jack talked with his dad, put together a plan and rented the land.\nWe finished our weeding and moved into the greenhouse to plant seeds. I poked holes into potting mix\u2013filled cells, dropped a seed into each cell and then topped them with potting mix. Noting the soft filtered light and the sound of the rain on the greenhouse roof, Jack told me, \u201cIt\u2019s important to enjoy each part of the process.\u201d He talked about the contrast between his father\u2019s conventional farm\u20141,000 acres of lettuce and 800 acres of onions\u2014and his two-acre organic farm of mixed vegetables and flowers. His family is very supportive. In fact, on Jack\u2019s parents\u2019 first visit, his mom brought a jar to take some of his soil home to his grandfather. The farming roots run deep in his family.\nJack\u2019s greatest challenge is figuring out how to market his produce. It\u2019s not easy for a new farmer to get into our farmers markets. A unique product helps, but so does product demand, so he chooses his crops with that in mind.\nJack has started a CSA, encouraging members to come out to visit his fields and to recycle their green waste in his compost piles\u2014to feel connected to the land that grows their food.\nHe is also setting up a farm stand where you can stop by for freshly picked produce.\nNoey shares a booth at the Saturday Farmers Market in Santa Barbara with her mother and stepfather, Debby and Shu Takikawa (The Garden of\u2026..). Noey sells vegetable, herb and flower seedlings. Her parents sell flowers, lettuce and other seasonal vegetables.\nWhen I arrived at their farm, Noey was outside the entrance to a plastic-covered greenhouse, floating seedling trays one at a time in a tub of fertilized water. She spoke softly as she bathed her baby plants.\nThis 24-acre property where Noey works and lives was purchased in the 1950s by her grandmother, who planted some of the first wine grapes in the Santa Ynez Valley. Now the vineyard is leased and maintained by Qup\u00e9 Wine Cellars. Her family farms three acres and rents another three acres nearby. Noey grows the seedlings they plant on the farm.\nAs we bathed the seedlings, Noey explained her family has kept the farm small enough that they haven\u2019t had to increase their costs by hiring employees. This has given them the economic flexibility to experiment with seeds, soils and growing methods.\nHer stepfather, Shu, taught her how to grow healthy vegetable seedlings. But when they added cut flowers, she spent a lot of time experimenting and recording the results. Noey\u2019s first season was a disaster, but she learned a lot about which nutrients each plant needed to thrive. Her parents and brother Kai helped her discard her failed plants and encouraged her to keep on experimenting.\nAfter feeding her seedlings, Noey put trays of marigolds and violas onto a wagon. I followed her up the path to a shade-cloth covered greenhouse. We brought along tubs of her homemade potting mix.\nAt the upper greenhouse, Noey filled straw pots with potting mix, and I gently slid the seedlings from each cell into a filled pot while Noey explained how she ended up back on the farm where she had played as a child.\nShe traveled after high school, \u201ctrying to find my place in the world,\u201d she says. She came back to Santa Barbara to get a degree in physics. But as her graduate studies became more abstract, she felt a need to connect more with the real world. She spent most of her free time at the farm helping Shu figure out how to grow healthier plants.\nShe left graduate school to move back to the farm full time. When she took over the plant nursery and started her own business, she realized this was exactly where she wanted to be. I understood this as I worked next to her, the morning sun warming my hands, stopping to watch the cat stalk a gopher or to study a spider with a load of"

        "passage": " also in preparatory responding to signals that predict reward. Reward-related processes are prevalent in the entire striatum (caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens), which receives massive input from the limbic system (e.g., amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex Selemon and Goldman-Rakic, 1985; Fudge et al., 2002). Functionally, the caudate specifically is thought to reinforce plans for complex behavior (Kawagoe et al., 1998; Cromwell and Schultz, 2003; O\u2019Doherty et al., 2004) based on an evaluation of action-outcomes provided by the nucleus accumbens, who is less selective for sensorimotor events (Schultz et al., 1992). The caudate thus plays a key role in sensorimotor/cognitive action preparation on the basis of motivation.\nConsistently, a number of primate studies have underlined the crucial role of the caudate nucleus in transforming motivational information into eye movement signals. In an oculomotor task, neurons of the primate caudate nucleus were found to respond in anticipation of reward-predicting stimuli, which in turn modulated neural oculomotor signals (Kawagoe et al., 1998, 2004) and corresponded to the saccade onset latency (Takikawa et al., 2002). This mechanism of motivational control of saccadic eye movement in caudate nucleus is supported by initial human findings, where participants received monetary rewards, following an anticipatory cue or following a button press response (Tricomi et al., 2004). Results showed only differential activation in the caudate nucleus if a perception of contingency existed between a button press response and a reward outcome.\nSuch a nexus between the oculomotor- and reward systems may be instrumental for the optimization of antisaccade performance in seniors and PD patients. In PD, the most rostro-dorsal part of the caudate is subjected to greater disruption than the relatively spared ventral region of the caudate (Grahn et al., 2008). This may leave the ventral connections of the caudate relatively intact and receptive for input from the ventral striatum and the limbic nodes of the reward circuit.\nThus oculomotor preparation may be facilitated by a transient increase of caudate activation as induced by the prospect of reward (Lauwereyns et al., 2002; Watanabe and Hikosaka, 2005), and this facilitation might alleviate the deficits associated with aging and PD. However, reward processing in itself is also affected by age and PD. Older adults have shown greater difficulty in learning reward associations, needing more trials before reaching the learning criterion, compared to young adults (Mell et al., 2005). Similar behavioral decrements have been found in non-medicated PD patients (Bodi et al., 2009). PD patients show poorer performance on reward-motivated probabilistic classification learning. These decrements have been related to changes in anticipatory reward cue processes. Neural evidence on age- and PD-related changes in the reward system is not unequivocal. While Samanez-Larkin et al. (2007) observed intact ventral striatal activation (and activation of the medial caudate and anterior insula) during gain anticipation in both younger and older adults, Schott et al. (2007) observed ventral striatal activation during reward anticipation only in the young. Healthy elderly and PD patients did not activate the ventral striatum during reward anticipation, only during reward feedback. As compared to healthy elderly, PD patients showed additional functional alterations in reward cue processing and reduced functional connectivity between the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area. Neural decrements in reward cue processing presumably reflect pre-synaptic degeneration of dopamine neurotransmission in PD and (milder) changes during aging in both the pre-and postsynaptic dopamine system throughout the human brain (Kaasinen et al., 2000; B\u00e4ckmann and Farde, 2001; Backman et al., 2006). This age-related vulnerability of the reward system has been further taken to explain loss of cognitive flexibility in older ages, by leading to impairments in reward processing, stimulus-response association learning and adaptation of existing associations to new situations (Marschner et al., 2005; Mell et al., 2005, 2009; Weiler et al., 2008). On the other hand, PD patients demonstrate increased search efficiency with increasing reward (Goerendt et al., 2004). Also, when required to adapt their manual force to an increasing reward, patients were able to exhibit greater force on trials in which larger rewards can be won, showing the same proportional increase as in controls (Schmidt et al., 2008).\nReward processing thus appears to be affected by age and PD in some studies but not in others. In this state of affairs the question whether deficient oculomotor preparation among seniors and PD patients can be facilitated by the prospect of reward remains unanswered. The presumably more intact ventral and limbic reward structures might trigger a transient increase of caudate activation, thereby enhancing inhibitory forces on the superior colliculus to improve goal-directed oculomotor function. The mesolimbic dopamine system may thus play a compensatory role in \u201cboosting\u201d the efficiency of interactions between motivational and impaired cognitive control processes in healthy aging and PD.\nTo address this question, we administered an antisaccade task to healthy young and older adults and PD patients, providing them pseudorandomly with the prospect of reward on some trials but not on others. This pseudorandom reward cuing is based on the principle that DA neurons in the reward system respond to the cue positively (with a phasic increase in firing) if the cue indicates an upcoming reward and they respond to the cue negatively (with a phasic decrease in firing) if the cue indicates no reward (Schultz et al., 1992; Kawagoe et al., 2004).\nWe expected older (compared to young) adults to display deficient oculomotor preparation (as indexed by increased antisaccade latencies), whilst PD patients were expected to perform worse than healthy elderly. We hypothesized further that oculomotor preparation would benefit from the prospect of reward. Most importantly, we examined whether such reward benefits can be observed in healthy elderly and in PD patients. In addition we manipulated spatial preparation and the duration of the interval between the instruction cue and the target, both to replicate typical findings and to ensure that our approach has the potential for oculomotor preparation benefits to become manifest even in older adults and PD patients. Thus we expected antisaccade latencies to be shorter and accuracy to be higher after specific preparation cues providing spatial information on the upcoming response, than after neutral preparation cues that give no spatial information. Likewise, we expected faster and more accurate antisaccades after long compared to shorter cue-target intervals.\nEighteen young adults (age 18\u201336, M = 24.0, 9 female), 18 elderly adults (age 64\u201385, M = 69.4, 9 female) and 20 PD patients (age 45\u201379, M = 61.8, 9 female) participated in the experiment after giving written informed consent. They were paid an amount of \u20ac37 for participation and 5 cents for every correct reward trial with a maximum of \u20ac6.40 for two blocks. Young adults were students at the University of Amsterdam. Elderly were recruited from a database of healthy elderly subjects1 who had previously expressed their interest in participation in cognitive aging research. Patients were recruited through Dutch national websites dedicated to PD\u2019s disease. Participants had normal or corrected-to normal vision, measured with the Landolt ring chart and were matched on IQ (crystallized IQ as measured by the \u201cNederlandse Lees Test Volwassenen\u201d (NLV) and fluid IQ as measured by the \u201cRaven Complex Forms\u201d). None of the young and senior participants had a history of neurological or psychiatric disorders, mild cognitive impairment, eye movement or vision problems, or was taking any drugs influencing the central nervous system. The PD patients fulfilled formal diagnostic criteria for PD according to the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), had a mean disease duration of 7 years (range of onset 2\u201313 years) and a mean estimated motor subscore of 16.7 (range 6\u201338) on the UPDRS which could be labeled as moderately affected when compared to other studies using this measure (Morgante et al., 2006; Harrison et al., 2009). None of the patients suffered from tremors in the neck or head. Patients were asked to continue taking their medication at the required time on the day of testing, and tests were planned 60\u201390 min after medication intake. Nine patients were receiving dopamine precursors (levodopa/carbidopa), six were taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, three were on catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT)-inhibitors and 14 patients were receiving one or more dopamine agonists. One patient did not take medication on a regular basis.\nThe experiment was divided into a training session and a main experimental session. During training, participants were presented with a series of trials to familiarize themselves with the stimulus-reward associations and antisaccade response requirements. Participants completed a 25-min training block and a 25-min experimental block, each subtending 128 trials, with a 10-min break between blocks. All experimental procedures were approved by a local ethics committee, and conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, international laws, and institutional guidelines.\nEach trial (see Figure 1) started with a central fixation dot surrounded by two square outlines (each subtending 3.8\u00b0 visual angle) on the left and right side of the fixation dot (distance 12.4\u00b0). After the fixation display a central visual instruction cue was presented (for 600 ms) followed by a variable cue-target interval of 4.5\u20136 s, terminated by a peripheral antisaccade target (a white asterisk subtending 2\u00b0, displayed for 500 ms).

To see this in more detail, we allow for some reaction of humans to their zombie enemies.

Mike Neal reportedly \"neither confirmed nor denied\" it.\nMatthews to Alex Flanagan of NFL Network on the Al Jazeera report: \"It's (expletive).\"\nThe Journal Sentinel's Michael Cohen shared more of Matthews' words: \"I have never talked with him or communicated with him.\"\nNeal spoke with Tom Silverstein of the Journal Sentinel: \"I'm sure you saw how (expletive) off Peyton Manning was about someone coming out with stuff like this.\"\nAs Ryan Wood of the Green Bay Press-Gazette reported: \"Mike Neal neither confirmed nor denied\" the report.\nPeppers also spoke with Silverstein, calling it \"not true...irresponsible journalism.\"\nA documentary into sports doping has named three Green Bay Packers linebackers in a report investigating distribution of various drugs, many banned by the NFL and other sports governing bodies.\nAl Jazeera America's report, scheduled to air Sunday evening, names Clay Matthews, Julius Peppers and Mike Neal.\nOne of the men allegedly involved said that Neal brought at least a dozen Packers players into his circle as part of his distribution efforts.\nThe report also names athletes like Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning (who has heavily denied his involvement), Philadelphia Phillies slugger Ryan Howard and Washington Nationals superstar Ryan Zimmerman.\nYou can see the full Al Jazeera America report below.\nOne of the two men who accused Packers players has attempted to recant his claims, both through social media and through media outlets such as ESPN.\nAl Jazeera America embedded an athlete in this hidden camera investigation.\nLiam Collins, a British track and field athlete, essentially played the role of an athlete who was trying for \"one last shot at Olympic glory\" for the investigation.\nAl Jazeera says he used cameras to meet with many people allegedly involved in doping athletes. One of them was, according to the network, a Vancouver-based pharmacist named Chad Robertson.\n\"Have I doped people? Oh, yeah,\" stated Robertson in what Al Jazeera said was a phone conversation.\n\"No one's got caught because the system is so easy to beat, and it still is.\"\nAl Jazeera said that Collins and Robertson met in person.\nAt about the 25:25 mark of the video above, Robertson made these claims about Neal and Matthews.\nNarrator: \"He claims to have already helped American football player Mike Neal, who also appears in the presentation from Robertson's new sports medicine company. Neal won a Super Bowl ring in 2011.\"\nRobertson: \"Mike Neal, here's a great story.  He plays for the Green Bay Packers. We changed his position from a defensive lineman to a linebacker. His salary (after working) with us went from making $400,000 a year to $2 million a year in four years. That's results.\"\nNarrator: \"With his Packers teammate Clay Matthews, Robertson claims he helped in a different way.\"\nRobertson: \"The NFC Championship Game, it was Green Bay, it was Seattle. I had Clay Matthews who is badly injured. We sent some narcotics to kill the pain because he could barely get up out of bed.\"\nNarrator: \"Later, Robertson named the drug as Percoset, which isn't banned, which should only be prescribed by a doctor. Neither Mike Neal nor Clay Matthews replied to our request for comment about Chad Robertson's claims.\"\nAbout 37:29 into the video, Collins talked with Charlie Sly, whom Al Jazeera said was a doctor of pharmacy based in Texas. He spoke of his relationship with Neal, Peppers and Matthews and, apparently, other Packers players.\nSly: \"Some guys just take it every day, like they refuse to stop it.\"\nInterviewer: \"Who's like the biggest hard head?\"\nSly: \"I don't know, maybe Mike Neal.\"\nNarrator: \"Charlie Sly claimed Mike Neal was a good friend. Through him, he met several other Green Bay Packers players.\"\nSly: \"Last year, I went out to Green Bay for like, six weeks. I set Mike's stuff up, but then, like, he started bringing everybody. I'm not even joking. More than half the team started to come by.\"\nInterviewer: \"Like who?\"\nSly: \"So Julius Peppers...so I would do everything, usually at Mike Neal's house or Julius' house.\"\nInterviewer: \"What's Julius like?\"\nSly: \"He's really cool, yeah.\"\nInterviewer: \"Is he pretty receptive to all this stuff?\"\nSly: \"Yeah. He's old, too. He's like 36.\"\nInterviewer: \"How does he find the D2...does he like it?\"\nSly: \"Yeah, but he doesn't take it that often. He might only take it two days a week, more for just recovery. He's already pretty big.\"\nSly: \"I probably talked to, I don't know, 25 people there.\"\nInterviewer: \"Already directed them, or...\"\nSly: \"I probably already directed like 10 of them, 12 of them.

[1] Disc herniations that lead to nerve-root compromise account for less than 15% of chronic low back pain cases. [2] Over 95% of lumbar disc herniations occur at L4\u20135 or L5-S1 levels, and only 2% of herniations require surgery, 4% have compression fractures, 0.7% have spinal malignant neoplasms, 0.3% have ankylosing spondylitis and 0.1% have spinal infections. [2, 3] Leg pain is estimated to be found in 25\u201357% of all low back pain cases and accounts for large costs, disability, chronicity and severity. [4, 5, 6] Many conservative treatments have been shown to be effective in the management of this condition and are favorable to pursue before considering any surgical interventions, such as: modalities, soft tissue therapy, spinal manipulations or mobilizations, pelvic blocking, McKenzie/end-range loading exercises, lumbar stabilization exercises and neural mobilizations, patient education, reassurance, short-term use of acetaminophen, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. [2, 3, 7\u201324] The purpose of this case report is to describe the successful management of a patient with low back and leg pain.\nA 31-year-old male recreation centre worker presented complaining of left sided low back, gluteal and leg pain that travelled down to his posterior calf for the previous 3\u20134 months after playing sports at his workplace. He rated the pain as a 3/10 on the visual analogue scale (VAS) and 7\u20138/10 at its worst (where 0 was no pain and 10 was the worst pain ever experienced). He recalled that when the pain started a few months prior that it had left him \u201cbedridden\u201d, but that his mobility had improved since. He stated that the low back pain \u201ccame and went\u201d and was constantly \u201cstiff\u201d. He identified the left sided leg pain as constantly \u201cdull\u201d and occasionally \u201csharp\u201d. The aggravating factors included prolonged sitting at work (after 20\u201330 minutes) and slouching. The relieving factors included stretching, walking and getting up from sitting. He reported taking no medications or supplements. He was a non-smoker, who walked regularly, had an average diet and slept well. He reported no previous traumas, surgeries, illnesses or medical conditions. He recalled a previous incident of mild back pain without leg pain in high school. The organ systems and red flags reviews were unremarkable. He had never seen a chiropractor, but did see his medical doctor annually for check-ups.\nThe working diagnosis was a left sided postero-lateral disc prolapse/herniation with referral/compromise of the left L5-S1 nerve root. The differential diagnoses included mechanical low back pain and muscular entrapment/piriformis syndrome. The prognosis was rated as moderate, due to the length of time and type of the injury. The plan of management included 1\u20132 weekly treatments for 2\u20133 weeks, followed by a re-evaluation. Treatments included interferential current, soft tissue trigger point and myofascial therapy, side posture traction mobilizations (a manual side posture posterior-anterior mobilization with long axis traction and deep flexion avoided) and pelvic blocking was"

The network is deemed highly important in Korean society, where collective group values are strongly emphasized.\nThe study by Etoos also reveals that there are a total of 34 high schools in the country that have produced a 100 percent college admission rate this year.<|endoftext|>Old Forge Little League!\nThursday June 20th we will be having a Donation Dinner to benefit our local ball players! 20%of ALL SALES will be donated including take out.

He's got this opportunity to come in to Formula One, he looks a really interesting talent, but he's just started to cut his teeth.\"\nAustralia's Motorsport News has fuelled the speculation that Webber's position will be taken by Ricciardo. After the British Grand Prix the magazine claims the Hispania driver visited the Toro Rosso factory for a seat fitting in readiness for 2012.\nHowever Ricciardo refused to be drawn on the speculation when asked in Hungary. \"It would be very nice! We'll see, there's always a lot of rumours going around. I think the end of 2012 is a long way away to be honest.

The appearance and the interior decoration have a good old atmosphere of Showa period. The restraunt serves low price buckwheat noodles like stand-up-eating soba noodles, and their buckwheat noodles have been called \"The comfort food of Takikawa people\". By the way, a photography is prohibited at the restraunt now, if customers want to take a picture, they should get a permit from the restraunt. In addition, prices of their dishes rise.\nI was surprised at about JPY 300, prices of most of their dishes. In addtion, I was more surprised at a numerousness of visitors. 3 people lined up when I visited here around 11:30 on Sunday. Because I did not expect it, I decided to come again. Meanwhile, visitors came over one after another. The reasonable price and average quality will take the local people captive.\nSpeaking of the Takikawa, Canola Flower Fields is famous. Takikawa Canola Flower Festival is held in late May. Except that, Takikawa Sky Park, Roadside Station Takikawa, Maruka Highland Lookout, Science Museum for Child, Colonizers' House are relatively popular tourist attractions. Hot springs gush out in the Takikawa, and a day trip onsen can be enjoyed in Ebeotsu Onsen and Takikawa Onsen.\nOnly 2 seats were vacant when I visited here around 14:30 again.

Anyway, I sat a counter seat, and ordered Curried Buckwheat Noodle Soup (\u30ab\u30ec\u30fc\u305d\u3070). The price was JPY 300.\nI was also surprised at serving speed for about 3 minutes. The buckwheat noodles were rather tender, but the curry soup was just right spicy taste. Ingredients were onions and pork. Customers can eat quickly for approximately 5 minutes.

Christmas is over and it's all looking a bit drab and dull out in the garden...\nThe snowdrops aren't ready to start blooming but I can see the first shoots. The Witch Hazels seem really reluctant to bloom as well and the berry colour I've been relying on has been stripped by the birds as they look for food. It's great to have some good winter tree shapes and last year's grasses are still looking good in the frost but now we need some COLOUR!\nTake a trip down to the garden centre and see what's happening. This is the best place to get some instant winter colour because shops sell what's looking good right now. You'll be surprised how many great plants there are and if you get a pot you can try out some combinations before making a final purchase. Here are some recipe ideas for a winter splash by your front door.\nWe need to depend on foliage quite a lot at this time of year so I go for the evergreens such as Skimmia japonica with its strong leaves, the grasses such as the variegated Carex Fishers Form and Elephant's Ears or Bergenia rubrum. An astonishing plant is Arum italicum Pictum which seems to leaf and flower at opposite times to other plants so it is always a good filler. My favourite though has to be the Christmas Box Sarcococca humilis with its sweet smelling flowers.\nIt's not the easiest time of year for flowers but you can cheat a little by buying pots of budding Narcissus that have been imported from warmer climes or greenhouses. I also planted Winter pansies in window boxes back in October but you might still be able to get some and they'll brighten any corner. I know a lot of you are less keen to go so bright, cheap and cheerful with plants but hey, it's only for a few months and your neighbours will appreciate them too! And then there are the heathers that can bring masses of colour to any arrangement.\nYou don't need to fuss over feeding at this time of year either as plants are not really actively growing at this time of year. Wait until Spring and then feed the pots with a good all round fertiliser. I like to stuff a lot of plants into a pot but this means re-planting quite regularly. I plant many of these plants into borders but if you want to keep the pots going for a few years then give them room to grow their roots and not compete.\n By the end of the month the first few flowers will be showing in the garden. There will be the first Narcissus February Gold, Snowdrops and Winter Aconites, the scent of early Viburnum species, Witch Hazel flowers and snow on bamboos. And you thought the Summer was the best time in the garden!\nYou can start to put your feet up a little now and perhaps plan what next summer's borders will be like. This is the time for preparation and what better way to shed those excess Christmas pounds than by getting out in the garden and digging a new border.\nLawns - there's not much you can do but remember to keep the lawn clear of leaves that will smother and kill the grass.\nBorders - if you've got a patch in need of some major renovation, dig it over now and let the frost break down the soil and manure for you before Spring planting.\nTender plants - keep an eye on tender plants by protecting from frost damage by either bringing into the greenhouse or conservatory or covering with a fleece. This applies to plants such as palms, tree ferns and Agaves.<|endoftext|>I knew Nicole still wanted Cara after all.

HPB conditions related to side effects of drugs used in treatment of IBD (Drug induced or associated hepatitis, pancreatitis, cirrhosis, Hepatitis B reactivation, hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma) 4. HPB conditions possibly related to IBD (Autoimmune pancreatitis, IgG4-associated cholangitis, fatty liver, hepatic amiloidosis, granulomatous hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis) (Navaneethan & Shen, 2010) The various HPB manifestations and their associations are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The aim of this chapter is to cover in detail primary sclerosing cholangitis, which is an important and frequently encountered HPB manifestation of ulcerative colitis.\n\n\n208\nHBP manifestations with a possibly shared pathogenesis and mechanism as IBD The association of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and ulcerative colitis (UC) was first reported by Loe in 1965 (Smith&Loe, 1965). The incidence of IBD in patients with PSC is 25-30%. Increasing awareness of association of PSC and UC led to more widespread use of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and hence more cases were diagnosed with PSC (Broome & Bergquist, 2006). The association of PSC and Crohn's disease, which was first described by Atkinson andCarroll in 1964 (Atkinson &Carroll, 1964), is relatively rare. The incidence of CD in PSC varies between 1.3-14% (Wiesner & LaRusso, 1980;Chapman et al., 1980;Rasmussen et al., 1997;McGarity et al., 1991;Faubion et al., 2001;Loftus et al., 2005;Tobias et al., 1983). The most eminent finding is rectal sparing. Colonic stricture and perianastomotic ulcers are relatively rare in this patient group. Patients with PSC and CD almost always have extensive colitis or ileocolitis, but never have isolated ileitis (Broome & Bergquist, 2006). About 85-90% of patients with PSC and IBD are comprised of UC patients and the remainder are comprised of patients with Crohn's colitis or Crohn's ileocolitis (Olsson et al., 1991). IBD can be diagnosed at any time throughout the course of PSC, and PSC can develop at any time throughout the course of IBD ( Fausa et al., 1991;Broome et al., 1990). However, IBD is often diagnosed many years before the diagnosis of PSC. PSC can occur many years after proctocolectomy for colitis; IBD can be diagnosed many years after liver transplantation for advanced PSC ( Fausa et al., 1991;Wiesner & LaRusso, 1980;Aadland et al., 1987;Chapman et al., 1980;Riley et al., 1997). As IBD and PSC can be asymptomatic, the time of diagnosis depends on the diagnostic alertness of the physician (Broome & Bergquist, 2006). PSC has a variable natural course. Nevertheless, PSC is typically characterized by progressive inflammation, obliterative fibrosis, damage to the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree and eventually biliary fibrosis, cirrhosis and finally liver failure. PSC is often diagnosed between the 3 rd and 5 th decades and male to female gender ratio is 2:1 (Chapman et al., 1980;Lee & Kaplan, 1995;. Freeman et al. observed that patients with PSC had more extensive endoscopic and histological inflammation of the afferent limb who had restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for UC than those with no concurrent PSC (Freeman et al., 2008). A report from Mayo Clinic has identified characteristic clinical, endoscopic, and histological findings in IBD accompanied by PSC as quiescent colitis, substantial preclinical phase, pancolitis, rectal sparing, backwash ileitis, pouchitis, and colorectal dysplasia/carcinoma (Loftus et al., 2005) (Table 3).\n\nPrevalence of IBD in patients with PSC\nThe prevalence of UC in patients with PSC varies from country to country in the range of 21-80% (Takikawa & Manabe, 1997;Bergquist A et al., 2002). The prevalence of PSC in patients with Crohn's disease varies between 1.4-3.4% (Rasmussen et al., 1997;Schrumpf et al., 1980;Shepherd et al., 1983). Colitis in PSC is often quiescent or mild. Therefore, all patients with PSC should undergo colonoscopy and multiple biopsies should be taken to estimate the true prevalence (Broome & Bergquist, 2006). An algorithm for screening for IBD in patients with PSC is given in Figure 1.\n\nPrevalence of PSC in patients with IBD\nThe prevalence of PSC in patients with IBD and persistently abnormal liver function tests is 2.4-7.5% (Olson R, et al., 1991;Aadland E et al., 1987). PSC prevalence is 5.5 % in patients with substantial colitis, and 0.5% in patients with distal colitis (Olsson et al., 1991). 1.3 to 14% of patients with Crohn's disease have PSC (Wiesner &LaRusso 1980;Chapman et al., 1980;Rasmussen et al 1997;McGarity et al., 1991;Faubion et al., 2001;Loftus et al., 2005). PSC can present as an asymptomatic disease characterized by mild increases in aminotransferases, episodes of normal liver function tests can also occur. The frequency of liver function test screening is decisive in determining the prevalence of this disease. However, there may also be liver enzyme elevations due to autoimmune hepatitis, fatty liver, colonic disease activation, total parenteral nutrition and steroid use (Loftus et al., 1997;Broome et al., 1994). Therefore, liver function tests at presentation may be misguiding. Ideally, liver function tests must be assessed when the colonic disease is in the inactive phase (Broome & Bergquist, 2006). An algorithm for PSC screening in a patient with IBD is presented below in Figure 2. Enlargement of perihepatic lymph nodes is a common finding in PSC (Outwater et al., 1992). The presence of enlarged perihepatic lymph nodes in a patient with UC should alert the  (Rabinovitz et al., 1990). Among 305 Swedish PSC patients, no difference between patients with and without IBD could be found (Broome et al., 1996). Currently, we do not have enough data to arrive at a conclusion that PSC in patients without IBD is an entity different from PSC that accompanies IBD. Rectal sparing and backwash ileitis are more common in patients with UC and PSC (Loftus et al., 2005). As rectal sparing is common in these patients, rectosigmoidoscopy is not adequate in demonstrating the association of UC and PSC, a colonoscopy is often recommended (Faubion et al., 2001;Perdigoto et al., 1991).\nThe clinical course of colitis is variable in patients who undergo OLT for PSC. MacLean et al have reported clinical healing in one third of patients, unchanged clinical course in one third, and worsening in the last one third (MacLean et al., 2003).\nIn UC patients operated on with an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, nonspecific inflammation of the pouch (pouchitis) is the most frequent long-term complication. Chronic pouchitis is more common in patients with PSC and UC when compared to those with UC only (60% vs 15%) (Penna et al., 1996). Pouchitis continues to occur after OLT in patients with PSC (Zins BJ et al., 1995).\n\nImpact of coexisting PSC on the disease behavior and course of IBD\nPatients with PSC and IBD have a different clinical course when compared to IBD patients not complicated with PSC, and this patient group has been defined by the Mayo clinic as a different clinical entity (Loftus et al., 2005). While UC can be diagnosed many years after PSC diagnosis and even after orthotopic liver transplantation(OLT), a patient with UC, who had a proctocolectomy or not, can be diagnosed with PSC many years later (Joo et al.,2009). Patients with UC and PSC more frequently experience rectal sparing, backwash ileitis, pancolitis, colorectal neoplasia when compared to patients with UC alone, and their prognosis is worse ( Faubion et al., 2001;Loftus et al., 2005;Loftus et al., 1997;Penna et al.;Heuschen et al., 2001;Lundkvist & Broome, 1997;Broome et al., 1995;Soetikno et al., 2002). However, there are studies reporting different results. A recent case -control study found no difference between patients with PSC plus IBD and IBD alone in terms of rectal sparing. The same investigators found similar backwash ileitis prevalences in the PSC plus UC group and the UC alone group (Joo et al., 2009). It was suggested that patients with PSC and UC may more likely run a quiescent course of colitis than UC patients without coexistent PSC. PSC-UC patients have colitis with a lower histopathological grade of inflammation (Joo et al.,2009). In a study from Sweden that included 76 patients with PSC, 7 of 11 asymptomatic patients had a histopathological diagnosis of IBD, and 2 of these 7 patients had colonic dysplasia. In the follow-up, these 2 patients died before developing any IBD symptoms"

        "passage": "etic two-week marathon of the United Nations Framework Convention Climate Change negotiations that take place very December.\nThe IPCC meeting came just after the news broke that greenhouse gas levels have reached 400 parts per million in the Arctic for the first time.\nThis is an important threshold. It is more than 800,000 years since there was this much CO2 in the atmosphere. The 2007 IPCC assessment stated that to avoid dangerous changes to our climate, global greenhouse gas levels have to be stabilized at 350 ppm. To get there, a global commitment is needed to reduce CO2 emissions by 40 per cent by 2020 over 1990 levels. There was supposed to be a new binding climate change treaty by 2009. Instead, the negotiations nearly collapsed that year in Copenhagen and since then governments have produced only fine statements, a framework for further negotiations and reduced targets.\nSince 2009, Canada, the United States and other countries have latched on to unscientific targets that make good sound bites. Canada and the U.S. committed to reduce their emissions by 17 per cent over 2005 levels. Just to be sure no one was confused about the real commitment of the Harper government, Canada withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, making it the only country in the world to officially abrogate this binding international agreement.\nThis spring the government slashed environmental protection legislation and demonized environmental groups and anyone who dared to criticize its no-hold-barred push for \"responsible resource development.\" The message was clear: You are either for the economy or the environment. You can't be both.\nAny hope of a sensible climate change policy based on science and fact rather than ideology and rhetoric has all but vanished off the government's radar. As the National Roundtable on the Economy and Environment (NRTEE) reported recently, \"Canada will not achieve its 2020 GHG emission reductions target unless significant new, additional measures are taken. More will have to be done. No other conclusion is possible.\"\nOf course, the Harper government doesn't need this kind of advice. After 20 years, the NRTEE, a body established by Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, has had its funding eliminated. In the words of Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird, why should the government continue to pay for advice it doesn't want to hear?\nYou don't have to go very far to see what the consequences of this kind of position. For a government that claims to have Arctic interests at heart, the policies of the Harper government are relegating a vast portion of the region to irreversible change.\nOn Canada Day, while Harper cabinet ministers fanned across the country to wave flags, flip burgers, and deliver the uniform lines about jobs, prosperity and growth fashioned in the Prime Minister's office, an updated graphic appeared on the website of the National Snow and Ice Data Centre in Boulder, Colorado. The centre produces daily updates of real-time satellite tracking of the state of Arctic sea ice. On July 1, the graphic showed a continued drop in multi-year sea ice that indicates that 2012 could beat previous record lows from 2007.\nHumans are causing this problem. Yes, the climate has cycles and natural variation. But at no time in planetary history has this much warming occurred in such a short time. It's not caused by sunspots or volcanoes and it's above the levels of the natural cycle, all of which skeptics and their paymasters like to point to. And even if we weren't causing it, we would have to take precautionary measures to ensure that we can adapt to it.\nWhat we know as human civilization has developed in the clement period since the last ice age -- a period of about 10,000 years. One hundred centuries may seem like a long time to us but it is a blink of the geological eye. While the planet will eventually rebalance itself -- in thousands of years -- we need to ask ourselves if what we know as human society will be around to see it.\nSince we can't answer this question with certainty, we need to think deeply about where our political leaders are taking us, in this country and elsewhere.\nThere is no chance of a healthy economy without a livable environment.\nJohn Crump is a CCPA research associate and an expert on Arctic and global environmental issues.

The news that the Chemical Safety Board is on the budget chopping block contradicts that promise \u2013 unless by \u201csafe\u201d we are only talking about threats from sources external to our borders.\nThe 40-employee Chemical Safety Board (CSB) is the only independent government agency that investigates industrial chemical disasters, issuing reports and safety recommendations to benefit industries throughout the nation. It issues no fines or penalties and makes no rules. Its investigations and reports also identify weaknesses in emergency planning and response that have preventative value not just for workers but also for the communities surrounding potentially hazardous work sites. Its annual budget of around $11 or 12 million is minuscule, particularly when measured against the enormous human and financial toll that a single chemical industrial disaster can inflict.\n\u201cA White House proposal to eliminate funding for the U.S. Chemical Safety Board signals a full retreat from two decades of progress against chemical disasters and would, if enacted, put American lives in jeopardy, health and safety experts said.\nTexas is no stranger to chemical catastrophes. The CSB was instrumental in investigating the 2005 explosion at BP\u2019s Texas City refinery that killed 15 and the 2013 explosion at the West Fertilizer Company that rocked the small town of West, Texas. That incident killed 5, injured more than 250 and damaged 150 buildings.\nIn Trump Budget Would Eliminate Chemical Safety Board, Jack Kaskey and Jennifer A. Dlouhy of Insurance Journal also highlight the important role that the CSB plays in investigating accidents, and offers several concrete examples of industry recommendations that enhanced safety practices in dangerous industries.\n\u201cThe CSB makes no rules and issues no penalties, but often identifies dangerous industry practices that are overlooked by enforcement agencies. Its scope of responsibility has included multi-fatality disasters from a 2013 fertilizer distributor in West, Texas, to BP Plc\u2019s Deepwater Horizon drilling rig blowout in 2010.\nThe U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) is disappointed to see the President\u2019s budget proposal to eliminate the agency. The CSB is an independent agency whose sole mission is to investigate accidents in the chemical industry and to make recommendations to prevent future accidents and improve safety. For over 20 years, the CSB has conducted hundreds of investigations of high consequence chemical incidents, such as the Deepwater Horizon and West Fertilizer disasters. Our investigations and recommendations have had an enormous effect on improving public safety. Our recommendations have resulted in banned natural gas blows in Connecticut, an improved fire code in New York City, and increased public safety at oil and gas sites across the State of Mississippi. The CSB has been able to accomplish all of this with a small and limited budget. The American public is safer today as a result of the work of the dedicated and professional staff of the CSB. As this process moves forward, we hope that the important mission of this agency will be preserved.\nThis entry was posted on Wednesday, March 22nd, 2017 at 9:22 am\tand is filed under Safety & Health.

        "passage": " are gone and the patient is still scratching, then it\u2019s time to look a little bit deeper into possible causes.\nHave you ever experienced the wonderful feeling of hay fever? With your nose running and your streaming eyes which are due to an allergic reaction to pollen.\nBut the symptoms affect a dogs\u2019 skin, instead of their nose and eyes like you and i.\nWhich actually means that allergies make a dog itchy.\nAnd just like with humans, dogs can also be allergic to anything from pollens to grass sap, perfumes to air fresheners, and also from dust mites to mold spores.\nSo if you want your dog to be as well-defended against allergies as possible, healthy skin is the ultimate solution.\nAnd sadly, licking and scratching can quickly damage your Labradoodles\u2019 skin.\nAnd damaged skin can mean that additional problems, such as yeasts and bacteria can quickly occur.\nAnd these secondary infections are also itchy, so this situation will just exacerbate the issue.\nThe first thing you should be by yourself is going on a hunt for fleas.\nTry to be on the lookout for those tell-tale flecks of dark dust in your dogs\u2019 hair.\nTry to collect some on a piece of damp cotton wool. If you notice there is an orange halo around each speck, this is what\u2019s referred to as flea dirt.\nIn this situation, the first thing you should do is treat your dog against fleas.\nIf the Labradoodle scratching has not improved much within a month, the vet will most likely suggest some further investigation.\nItching still won\u2019t stop?\nThere are quite a few things you can do at home to make an itchy Labradoodle feel more comfortable.\nIf you\u2019ve tried everything and the dog still keeps scratching, the time for the vet to get involved has come.\nThe vet will try to identify and find the correct treatment for the itch.\nThese treatments can include using antibiotics, medicated shampoos, and special anti-inflammatory drugs.\nIf the vet diagnoses your dog with allergies, there are a few options for treatment.\nNormally this can involve using drugs that will suppress the itch but there are also some other non-drug options.\nImmunotherapy vaccines: A bespoke vaccine is developed. This vaccine contains small amounts of the allergen that triggers your dogs\u2019 itch. The idea with this is that giving small, but increasing amounts of allergen. This will allow the immune system to get used to the allergen and in the end, it will result in the unwanted exaggerated response being turned off.\nBiological therapies: The new hot thing is called Cytopoint. This injection, which is to be given every 4 \u2013 8 weeks, isn\u2019t labeled as a drug but instead an antibody. It\u2019s also to remove the pathway that triggers the itch, which in turn will stop it from developing entirely.\nThe downside is that both of the above methods are quite expensive.\nSteroids: Inexpensive and highly effective. Nonetheless, they have a high risk of side effects which means they\u2019re often not the first choice.\nCyclosporine (Atopica): Originally developed as a means to prevent organ rejection in transplant medicine, these will help switch off the unwanted immune response. They are very effective and without an extensive list of serious side-effects, but they are still quite expensive!\nOclacitinib (Apoquel): Another relatively new anti-itch medication, this has proved to work quite well for some dogs and is almost free of side-effects. But as it typically is, this is also quite expensive.\nWe have some good news but also some not as good news.\nIf your dog is scratching because of parasites that is something can be cured, as getting rid of the bugs will typically bring a stop to the itching and scratching.\nThe less welcome news is that if your dog is suffering from allergies that is something which can\u2019t be cured but only kept in check.\nThis involves taking a lot of small steps a time. Making several minor changes adds up to a big increase in comfort.\nIf it is just the occasional lazy scratch of the ear that is very common and nothing to worry about. But excessive scratching in a dog is something to act on immediately.\nThe most common things are typically fleas as the obvious cause of itchiness.\nBut if you can\u2019t find any fleas on your Doodle, finding the explanation can prove to be quite complicated.\nIf you have even the smallest amount of doubt go and see the vet early, this will be a big help in avoiding unnecessary complications such as loss of hair and infections.\nAnd if your dog sleeps on the bed with you, getting rid of its\u2019 itch means you will get a night of infinitely better sleep.\n\nIt is also convenient to use and typically kills fleas within 10 minutes of application.\nThis flea medicine stood out to us because it kills a wide variety of parasites through contact with no biting required.\nThis means that your pet is protected from irritation and deadly diseases that can be transmitted by pest bites.\nReviewers say Bayer K9 Advantix II Extra Large Dog is highly effective, affordable, and easy to apply.\nPet Oatmeal Anti-Itch Shampoo & Conditioner In One! is a fantastic shampoo to help with your dogs\u2019 itchy skin.\nThis is shampoo is based on organic oatmeal, baking soda, & aloe vera with coconut that provides natural & instant itch relief!\nNot only does it help with Labradoodle itching it also neutralizes the dog smell for days and makes the coat very shiny.\nAnd a nice little bonus is that after your bottle arrives, you\u2019ll be given the option to send in a pic of your pet to the supplier.\nWhen you do, they\u2019ll donate a portion of the profits to a pet with cancer & reply with a pic of the pet you and your pet helped.\nAll Natural Anti Itch Oatmeal Spray is instant relief for an itchy Labradoodle.\nThis spray is a plant and botanical based oatmeal baking soda spray that provides instant, soothing, topical, relief to pets suffering from flea bites, hot spots, grass allergies, pollen allergies, food allergies, surgical stitches from surgery, scratches, and flea-bitten or raw and irritated skin.\nIt\u2019s made in the USA and they offer a 100% Money Back Guarantee, so if you aren\u2019t happy with the results, just return the product.\nHow Much Sleep Does a Labradoodle Need?<|endoftext|>47.

The bacteria were exposed to these copper compounds in the from of agar plate (Bacto potato-dextrose agar) and of aqueous solution. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of copper sulfate obtained by the agar method was one hundred times higher than that by aqueous solution. The high resistance to copper sulfate was observed with P. caryophylli (3mM), P. cepacia (4.5 mM), P. gladioli (4.25 mM), P. glumae (3.2 mM), P. solanacearum (2.25 mM), P. sytingae pv. aceris (2.25 mM), P. syringae pv. actinidiae (3.0 mM), P. syringae pv. maclicola (2.0 mM), P. syringae pv. tomato (2.75 mM), P. tolaasii (2.75 mM), Erwinia chrysanthemi pv. zeae (2.75 mM), Agrobacterium tumefaciens (2.25 mM), and Xanthomonas capmpestris pv. vesicatoria (1.75 mM). The members of rRNA group II of Pseudomonas were consistent in the high copper resistance. Each bacteriu \u2026 More m was???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\nCopper resistance in P. glumae, P. syringae pv. actinidiae, P. syringae pv. maculicola and P. syringae pv. tomato was confirmed to be plasmid origin. The plasmid of P. glumae (pPgCul) and P. syringae pv. actinidiae (pPaCul) were self-transmissible. Another plasmid of the latter (pPaCu2) was not transmissible. Copper-resistance plasmids did not always associate with high level of resistance. In P. sytingae pv. photiniae, for example, moderate copper resistance (MIC 0.8 mM) was also determined by a plasmid, although its properties have not been elucidated in detail. These copper-resistance plasmids sometimes carried other phenotypic properties e. g., streptomycin resistance in plasmids of P. syringae pv. actinidiae and extracellular polysaccharide synthesis in the plasmid of P. syringae pv. maculicola.\nIn the majority of bacteria tested, high correlation was observed between the degree of resistance to copper sulfate and that to copper hydroxide. However, P. cepacia, P. gladioli, P. glumae and P. sytingae pv. actinidiae were different from others in the behavior to these two copper compounds. In P. syringae pv. actinidiae, the resistance to copper hydroxide was greater than that to copper sulfate. The relationship was just opposite in P. cepacia, P. gladioli and P. glumae. These facts suggested that the diverse mechanisms are involved in copper resistance of plant pathogenic bacteria.\n[Publications] Goto, M., A. Kodera, Y. Fujita, M. Nakajima, S. Tsuyumu, Y.

It was in Lancaster County that some historians claim to be the location of the first battle of the Civil War. On September 11th, 1851, a Maryland plantation owner sought his stolen property in Pennsylvania: four runaway slaves seeking shelter in Christiana, a village in southeast Lancaster County. Under the 1850 federal ruling named the Fugitive Slave Act, the plantation owner was technically, but not morally, within his rights. In the end, he didn't get what he came for...and never returned to Maryland. Four Quakers and thirty-four former slaves killed the plantation owner in whatever altercation followed their meeting; not only did they commit murder, but the victim was an aristocratic white male, and the action openly defied the very recent ruling of the United States Supreme Court. All thirty-eight participants in the incident were charged with treason. Within ten years, the United States would officially be split asunder.\nNow, the location in Christiana is an authentic historical site recognized by the National Park Service and part of the Underground Railroad Network.

You can share photos, video clips, regional music data, papers, as well as applications from one tool to another. It matters not what system you\u2019re utilizing due to the fact that SHAREit only interacts with other SHAREit-enabled tools.\nIt doesn\u2019t transfer information over a general Wi-Fi connection or Bluetooth. Rather, it creates a direct cordless connection with approximately 5 gadgets like a little network. Once attached to another tool, data can be sent as well as obtained. You could likewise duplicate a gadget as well as send its contents to another gadget.\nThe best part of SHAREit is that it\u2019s multiplatform, including Windows COMPUTER.\nBeing multiplatform additionally triggers troubles for SHAREit since you need to fix connection issues on different gadgets. Because SHAREit doesn\u2019t use a link over a Wi-Fi network or Bluetooth, it needs to develop a straight connection with one more gadget. This suggests the tool produces a hotspot that gadgets link to.\nThe app additionally doesn\u2019t discuss that you will certainly need to readjust your Wi-Fi setups. In the Setups food selection there are options to \u201cfavor hotspot\u201d when sending or getting, but the app never ever discusses that devices will create hotspots to share information. SHAREitis additionally buggy. My very first attempts at transferring files created the application to ice up. Both gadgets needed to reboot SHAREit prior to the transfer functioned.\nWhen SHAREitdoes function, it is fast. Photo transferred promptly. Video had an irregular transfer rate and also transfers often looked iced up. Once submits transfers are complete, the app disables the wireless connection as well as returns back to the original link. This means if you wish to share another data, you need to go via the steps of starting and also connection to the hotspot once more.\nThe major problem with SHAREit is that it claims to be easy to use yet it\u2019s really sort of confusing for the typical individual.\nThere are a lot of simpler alternatives to transfer images and also files. SHAREit benefits video clip, yet that depends upon just how big the data it.\nSHAREit promises on simplicity of use, but hasn\u2019t gotten to that objective yet. If you intend to transfer files, attempt Pushbullet.\nRelated Posts of \"Download SHAREit For Windows Latest Version\"<|endoftext|>People who want to escape the cold European winter and spend it in Thailand need a Thai Visa for this time as well.\n The latter, however, only if one is over 50 years old.\nThe costs for a long-term Tourist Visa (180 days, multiple entries) or a Non-Immigrant Visa (1 year, multiple entries) are the same and are around 150 Euros.\nTourist Visa or Non Immigrant?\nTo pass about 6 months in Thailand you have to make at least 3 entries with the tourist visa (60 days each), while you need only two entries (90 days each) with the Non-Immigrant \u201cO\u201d visa.\nIt should be remembered that these trips / entries of course also cause costs. On the other hand, a tourist visa is easier to get than a non-immigrant visa.\nIf you want to stay in Thailand without a visa, you can do so for up to 2 month only. You\u2019ll get 30 days when you enter Thailand for the first time and you can make an extension for another 30 days at any Immigration Office.

A survey has revealed that an additional source of profit is available to highway contractors from the expanding VE activities in federally aided highway programs. Contractors have found that savings and additional profits from a Value Engineering Change Proposal (VECP) can be significant. VE is now mandatory in the design phase for EPA projects of $10 million or over, excluding interceptor and sewer costs. A 1975 workshop in value engineering organized by the Federal Highway Administration is discussed and it is noted that this training effort will continue and additional workshops will be made available to state highway and transportation agencies.<|endoftext|>as of \"nexus-prisma\": \"^0.9.1\"\nFurther, I am grateful to the following people for telling me about errors and typos in the hardback edition: Nimrod Priell, David Marker, Giannis Kanellopoulos, Hiroki Takikawa, Jun Tsunematsu,Takuto Sakamoto, Shinya Obayashiand, Anna Ballarino, Arthur Spiriling, and the hypothesis user named arnaud.\nFigure 4.3: Schematic of the experimental design from Schultz et al.

Staff from affiliates working in Italy, Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden and Romania attended the two day training, ensuring interesting exchanges of experiences.\nDoctor Bobby Joseph, FWF\u2019s health and safety specialist and auditor trainer, led the training, while local auditor Melisa Cerizza shared experiences from auditing in Italy and Portugal.\nDuring the training, participants learned about the practical aspects of factory auditing on the spot in the factory. They also participated in discussions and practical exercises. The focus countries of the training, Portugal and Italy, are what FWF define as low risk countries. This means that even if full audits are not necessary in these countries, affiliates should know country specific risks and be able to follow up on these.\nThis was the first time FWF offered a factory audit training specifically targeting affiliates\u2019 staff. Because of the focus of the training, FWF affiliates sourcing in Italy and Portugal were invited to participate. There was a big interest in the course and shortly after sending out the invitation all fifteen places on the course were taken. Evaluations showed that many of the participants were very interested in receiving more trainings from FWF. FWF is already in the process of developing more training modules for affiliates and their staff which will be launched during the first half of next year.<|endoftext|>Come to Grainger when you need vertical milling machines to expand your operation or replace aging equipment.

However, serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels showed statistically significant differences 2 and 12 months after surgery between the two groups (P<0.05). Serum AMH levels did not show statistically significant differences between the two groups because of the large difference in values between individuals; therefore, we calculated and compared the increase or decrease in the AMH levels of each individual as a ratio based on the AMH levels at the time of enrollment. Sequential changes in serum AMH levels and ratios after enrollment were recorded (Fig. 1B C). The serum AMH ratios at 1 year after surgery were significantly higher in the DNG group than those in the GnRHa group (Fig. 3 A). There were 4 patients in the GnRHa group and 13 patients in the DNG group, who wanted to continue DNG treatment after the trial period concluded. Even when analyzed in a subgroup of patients without post-trial medication to account for drug effects, AMH ratios at 1 year after surgery were higher in the DNG group than in the GnRHa group (Fig. 3B).\nEndometriosis is associated with an inflammatory peritoneal environment [17]. The cytokines and growth factors were examined in response to hormonal treatment for endometriosis using a cytokine and growth factor antibody array. The serum levels of cytokines and growth factors were compared at the time of admittance and two months after surgery, as the study intended to investigate the effects of hormonal treatment during medication intake. Among the 42 cytokines and growth factors, there are five were common cytokines upregulated in the GnRHa group and downregulated in the DNG group (Fig. 4 A). IL-6 is a significantly correlated inflammatory cytokine with hormonal treatment changes. Further examination of the serum IL-6 levels was conducted using CLEIA and it was observed that the DNG group showed lower levels of IL-6 after 4 months of hormonal treatment (Fig. 4B). The ratio was calculated by serum IL-6 levels after 4 months of hormonal treatment divided by the serum IL-6 levels at the time of enrollment. When the cutoff value was set at 0.5, the number of patients in the DNG group whose ratio of serum IL-6 levels was less than 0.5 was significantly higher than that of the GnRHa group (P<0.01, Fig. 4 C). Furthermore, the changing status of AMH and IL-6 levels demonstrated a direct correlation with the DNG group but not statistically significant (Fig. 4D).\nIn this study, a novel insight was reported regarding the functional mechanism of perioperative hormonal treatment related to ovarian reserve preservation after endometrioma cystectomy. In the comparison of the AMH levels at the time of entry and 1 year after surgery, the serum AMH levels at 1 year were higher in the DNG group than those in the GnRHa group. Comprehensively, 17 (100%) of the 17 patients in the GnRHa group exhibited decreased AMH levels, whereas 5 (22%) of 23 patients in the DNG group exhibited increased AMH levels compared to pre-treatment levels. Moreover, none of those in the GnRHa group was able to maintain 70% of the level of AMH 1 year after surgery, while 14 (60%) of 23 patients in the DNG group were able to maintain over 70% of the level of AMH 1 year after surgery compared to pre-treatment levels.\nFirst, we believe that preoperative hormonal therapy will improve the surgical procedure. A previous report suggested that preoperative hormonal therapy (GnRHa and danazole) affects the complexity of stripping the capsule and the associated loss of follicle [15]. However, that study\u2019s criteria for preoperative treatment were biased in the case selection with an unstandardized preoperative hormonal therapy period. Ozaki et al. reported that symptoms related to endometriosis were completely decreased after administration of DNG compared to those in GnRHa; however, surgical outcomes such as surgical duration and blood loss were not significantly different between the two groups [18]. Based on the findings from this previous study and the concurrent findings from the present study, it can be concluded that the use of DNG as a preoperative hormonal treatment has no significant benefit to improve surgical accessibility compared to that in GnRHa. Additionally, the benefit of DNG treatment on ovarian reserve preservation is not due to reduced tissue damage during cystectomy, especially loss of follicles by the striping technique.\nEndometriosis is known to be related to inflammatory responses [17]. Previous reports have shown that several inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, interleukin-8 (IL-8), and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), were significantly elevated in the peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis [19]. Patients with endometriosis are constantly exposed to inflammation and even postsurgical inflammatory response could be another reason for the damage to the ovarian reserve. In this study, the relationship was analyzed between the serum AMH maintenance rate and the decreased ratio of IL-6 in each hormonal group. We focused on IL-6 because it is an inflammatory cytokine with lower level in the serum of the DNG group compared to that of the GnRHa group after 4 months of hormonal treatment. We speculated that IL-6 was suppressed by DNG treatment and thus proceeded to analyze it in more detail. Considering the time required for rearrangement of follicle cohorts, we hypothesized that the condition at the end of hormonal treatment would affect ovarian reserve; therefore, we compared serum IL-6 levels in the two groups after hormonal treatment ended (4 months). We also analyzed IL-6 and AMH levels 14 months after enrollment. However, there was no significant difference in the evaluations between the two groups (data not shown). In an in vitro study, Ichioka et al. suggested that DNG can influence the inflammatory response by downregulating inflammatory factors through progesterone receptors [20]. Based on the findings from previous studies and the concurrent findings from the present study, DNG is effective for ovarian reserve preservation by reducing the inflammatory response during the perioperative period and other endometriosis-related inflammation reactions [21, 22].\nAnother possible reason why DNG worked so effectively on ovarian reserve after ovarian cystectomy is the difference in medication effect compared to GnRHa. From our data on serum FSH levels in each group, DNG maintains higher basal secretion of FSH from the pituitary than GnRHa, and it may be effective in rearrangement of follicle cohorts derived from residual primordial follicles after ovarian cystectomy. AMH is secreted from primary to small antral follicles [23], and these follicles are FSH sensitive [24,25,26]. It is suggested that DNG treatment maintains basal FSH secretion, which promotes the growth of primary and small antral follicles and then increases AMH levels after medication, even before surgery. Since it takes approximately 180 days for folliculogenesis from primordial follicles to preovulatory follicles [6], the AMH levels at the time of measurement reflect the status of the medication several months before. Further analysis of the effect of DNG on ovarian follicle cohorts is needed, but the efficacy of the medicine and anti-inflammatory response may have had a positive effect on the ovarian reserve.\nOur study has the limitation that although this was a randomized controlled trial, it was not double-blinded. While it might have affected the methods of the surgical approach, our study showed that there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of hemostatis, percentage of patients who had complications with resection of follicles, suturing, and that the surgical approach was comparable between the two groups. In terms of the surgical approach, we speculated that the surgical technique did not influence the difference in AMH levels between the two groups.\nThis study demonstrates clear evidence that perioperative DNG treatment is more beneficial than GnRHa treatment for ovarian reserve preservation in patients with endometriosis indicated for endometrioma cystectomy. Further studies are required to investigate the significance and physiology of serum AMH levels and the effect of DNG in patients with endometriomas with regard to prospective live births.\nBulun SE, Yilmaz BD, Sison C, Miyazaki K, Bernardi L, Liu S, et al.

In 2008 and 2009, the cultivars were tested for resistance to the Pc003 isolate collected in Youngyang, Gyeongbuk province. In 2010, the selected cultivars in the previous years were tested by inoculating with 3 isolates obtained from the pepper plants in Miryang in Gyeongnam province, Youngyang in Gyeongbuk province, and Goesan in Chungbuk province. A continuous variation in resistance from highly resistant to susceptible was observed among the commercial pepper cultivars. It was also noted that some cultivars, although their names were initiating with ``Yeokgang`` or ``PR`` meaning Phytophthora resistance, were very low in resistance or susceptible. When the resistant cultivars selected in 2008 and 2009 experiment were inoculated with the 3 isolates, all the commercial cultivars except a rootstock, ``Tantan``, succumbed to the exceptionally virulent Pc005 (Miryang) isolate. Pc002 (Goesan) was a little more virulent than Pc003 (Youngyang). A few cultivars resistant to Pc003 (Youngyang) were severely infected by Pc002 (Goesan). Significant interaction in analysis of variance suggested the differential interactions between cultivars and pathogen isolates.

For Kyrgyzstan it should to identify the Lake Issyk-Kul, Biosphere Territory \u201cIssyk-Kul\u201d, for Tajikistan \u2013 Nature protection territory as \u201cIskanderkul\u201d lake.\nTaken into account the climate changes and the reducing of biopersity in the world, and in Central Asian area particularly, the main objectives of the protection zones are an ecological and economical development of the regions, and also biopersity conservation. Flora of protection zones has more than 1000 species of plants it is rich by medicinal, essential oil, tanniferous, melliferous, phytoncide plants, and forming almost 50 plant communities.\nRegistration, systematization and analysis of the status and distribution of medicinal plants with new information technologies are important for protection territories, as modern computing and information technologies offer new opportunities to address the most important problems of biopersity conservation and control over the state of ecosystems in the context of climate changing, both on regional and biosphere levels. Mainly it concerns the possibilities of constructing spatial and dynamic models of ecosystems with different dimensions, which have forecasting capacity. The development of modeling that would reflect different aspects of organization, status and trends of biopersity, requires the establishment of universal information systems, which would contain an extensive standardized and accessible information on the taxonomy of living organisms, status and distribution of natural populations and ecosystems on different levels of organization, resource and introduction potential species. Creation of an electronic Cadastre and Atlas of data bases \u201cMedicinal Plants of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan\u201d with search facilities on main groups of plants and plant communities has a particular importance.\nElectronic Cadastre and Atlas is aimed on ensuring systematization and providing a wide access to various information on biopersity of medicinal plants of protection zones, based on modern information technology. During the work it is expected to develop common approaches to the systematization and preservation of perse botanical and ecological information, to integrate this information into Geographic Information System (GIS).\nThe main sources of information are data, collected by researchers during several decades in biological institutions, academic journals, monographs, textbooks, materials stored in herbaria, as well as results of our experimental research and field journals of expeditions.\nBecause of this, joining efforts of specialists of various specialties \u2013 taxonomists, florists, geobotanists, ecologists, and IT specialists\u2013 is now important for organizing a unified information system on biopersity of flora, in particular medicinal plants.\n1. Reference lists of taxa.\n2. Species biopersity.\n3. Diversity of communities.\n4. Nature protection.\n5. Resources and introduction.\nGIS support. Considerable part of information in Electronic Atlas will have a spatial reference. Need for integration analysis and management of heterogeneous information, as well as presenting it in a form of thematic maps, schemes, diagrams and other documents makes attractive the use of geographic information systems. The main purpose of creating geoinformation system of atlas is construction of information system, ensuring identifying spatial patterns of behavior of objects of biopersity. The basis of GIS of electronic atlas is a map database, which consists of digital cartographic base and a variety of digital maps, showing both thematic loads of electronic atlas and space-time characteristics of studied objects.\nThe objective of the Project is to develop an electronic Cadastre and Atlas \u201cMedicinal Plants of Protection areas of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan\u201d.\n1. Collection, analysis and systematization of data on medicinal plants of protection areas of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan\".\na. Designing the structure of semantic database, it\u2019s filling and creating a database describing each species of medicinal plants.\nb.

Two phenomena are increasing the number and scale of urban floods caused (or exacerbated) by the presence of driftwood: 1) first, the gradual spread of vegetation along riverbanks and river basins upstream of towns and cities over the past 60 years has increased the quantity of dead wood available, particularly for high rises in water levels liable to sweep a large quantity of wood in the direction of urban areas and (2) due to climate change, we expect to see an increase in the number and intensity of these water level rises in future decades (e.g. Hirabayashi et al., 2013).\nThe challenge of managing dead wood upstream and in urban areas is therefore a relatively new issue in our waterways and wood is not yet systematically taken into account as a risk factor in the absence of a rigorous assessment of the risks connected to wood, despite the fact that this risk is increasing (Le Lay, 2007) and that recent events have damaged urban crossings in Switzerland and Italy. It is therefore becoming vital to better understand the factors governing flows of wood transported by waterways and the consequences of these flows in particularly developed areas, i.e. urban areas.\nThis project aims to characterise the risk represented by wood in waterways passing through towns and cities, and identify current practices for assessing this risk and taking it into consideration, in order to provide managers with suitable common guidelines to reduce the risk of flooding in urban environments.<|endoftext|>As my tenure as interviews editor at Queen Mob's Teahouse continues, the fifth interview is now online: an interview with Ann Tweedy, conducted by Mary Kasimor.

They're usually BYOB, so anyone can get over \"stage fright\" before the evening really gets going. That said, noraebang makes for an excellent party space or just a fun place to chill and hang out.\nJulia and I got \"\ud1a0\ub124\uc774\ub3c4\" (Tornado) desserts at Lotteria!\nMy first experience with a karaoke room was in Taiwan (where it's called \u5361\u62c9-OK), but the selection of English songs was paltry. Here in Korea, even the smallest of \ub178\ub798 \uc5f0\uc2b5 \ubc29 (Yeah, some of the \"classier\" NLB are called \"singing practice rooms\" instead of \"singing rooms\") has hundreds of hits from the American songbook.\nNLB was on my Korea bucket list, and I wanted to knock it out early on -- with friends from Orientation -- especially because I'd need some experience before my principal and co-teachers invite me out to a \ud68c\uc2dd (hweshik, or dinner meeting that is commonly followed by \ub178\ub798\ubc29). It was a couple of weeks into Orientation before I finally had the time and energy to spend a night out. It was the night after our placement ceremony, and I wanted to celebrate. My friends and I went into town (tiny little Goesan...) and hit up the Lotteria first. Lotteria is like the Korean version of McDonald's. I really wanted to try a \"\ud1a0\ub124\uc774\ub3c4\" (Tornado), which is like a McFlurry but much, much smaller. In fact, serving sizes of everything in Lotteria were rather meager. But I guess it keeps Koreans from overeating the way Americans do. Non-Olympic athlete Americans, that is.\nAfter Lotteria and a quick round at B&B, it was NLB time! We went to a place called \"\uc2a4\uce74\uc774 \ub178\ub798 \uc5f0\uc2b5 \ubc29\" and got a room for two hours for 30,000\uc6d0 (a little less than $30). Because there were a dozen of us, it turned out really cheap for us all, so that was great. And then... let the singing begin!\nTyler and Sara jamming to Justin Bieber's \"Boyfriend\". Yup.\nWe didn't even try any of the Korean songs, except for one, but I didn't know it, so... oh well. Most of our time was spent in 90's pop, Disney songs, and \"Call Me Maybe\"-esque fare. My favorites were probably \"Lady Marmalade\" from Moulin Rouge, Blink 182's \"Semi-Charmed Kind of Life\" (although mid-way through the song I got really embarrassed because I remembered what the lyrics were actually referring to...) and \"Colors of the Wind\".\nIt was almost one in the morning when we finished -- I haven't been awake that late for the past month -- and we walked back to campus, singing Adele and the Pok\u00e9mon theme song very loudly. All in all, it was tons of fun! Just the kind of thing I needed after a stressful week. I'd like to go again, but I don't think I'll have time, because Orientation is almost over. Who knows what it'll be like if I actually have to go to NLB with my colleagues? I swear it's a thing here. I guess I'll look forward to it, if it's anything close to this!\nToward the end of the night (like... 12:30am-ish), everyone was up and dancing.

During Joseph Conrad\u2019s lifetime, little objectiveness was made over his 1899 novel Heart of Darkness. This novel, which possibly has Conrad\u2019s numerous endowments as an author, has been perused as a scorching evaluation of European colonialism in Africa. It remains today, a standout amongst the most omnipresent matters in college course syllabi around the United States and with it comes a various range of perspectives, studies, and emotions.\nIt goes to lengths to scrutinize the prudence of ill-natured Europeans, so intensely established in the social cognizance of the book. It makes a point of demonstrating the unsafe impacts the colonial exertion has on the mind of both its narrator and its focal character, Marlow. Which is all to state that it is no longer astounding that such a commonly perused work ought to be the concern of a lot of controversies.\nThis 1899 novel by Joseph Conrad is showing how the author is struggling with his acceptance with having a bigoted viewpoint and encompasses colonialism by nature with stories of imperialist conquest. For the first situation, the controversy begins with how Conrad\u2019s writings are often proclaimed as a triumph of anti-colonial estimation; however, it is just as racist as anyone would primarily anticipate nineteenth-century writings on Africa to be. In Daniel and Brigit Marie-Katkin\u2019s article, these two are criticizing the nature of Joseph Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness and its contention of the crude appeal and the manner of acculturated appearances of wickedness disadvantaging the African people by Marlow and his Company men.\nAfricans move toward becoming Marlow\u2019s focal point, with who he can play out his philosophical and existential battles. Their reality and their exoticism empower his self-examination. In Todd Kuchta\u2019s article imagology gives an ideologically unbiased strategy for investigation and targets the focal point"

Secular culture can be constricting & permeates most aspects of our lives which makes the task daunting to the lone Christian who doesn't know how to approach the matter with discernment.\nWe have seen Christians transform the communities around them but not before they were persecuted, mocked or lied about. Those are the ones who endured.\nI have also seen Orthodox Christians who I considered pillars but through the steady progression of spiritual compromise and pleasure seeking became avid relationship seekers, halted their prayers, services, became vain in appearance, shisha smokers, etc.\nThe saddest part is not that they fall into these sins since every repentant sinner finds forgiveness, but they`ve have become the prime defendant camp of such practices, through opinionated self-assertive pride and the worship of their judgment of things. So long as they have the words and arguments for it they`re satisfied. In reality they have begun to worship their own minds and discernment of things and have become so clouded in their spiritual insight that one wonders if they ever possessed it.\nTo fall so far doesn`t happen quickly, and the demons make sure it`s at a slow steady pace (evagrius ponticus) because our human nature is most corruptible by the slow passage of time and compromise. When the devil is quick it`s in all too discernible experience for the soul and we`re careful to catch our fall.\nThat`s why priests and bishops are constantly criticized when they warn against `this or that`. We charge them with `extremism` and `lack of understanding`. But what they see and what we`ve perhaps been blinded to is that the demons`vocation is to harpoon the whale. The whale eventually dies from its injuries or loss of blood, and it takes time. All that is need is a hook, a seed or thought; perhaps a justification. Then the doubt is sowed & subsequent laxity of spiritual thinking.\nProbably not what you were asking about. But I was reminded of something I read in Evagrius Ponticus.<|endoftext|>In news of the ironic; a Los Angeles memorial tree planted on behalf of the Beatle\u2019s lead guitarist George Harrison was killed by\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 BEETLES!!\nYup, you heard me right\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The Beatle\u2019s tree was killed by actual beetles.\nBecause he was a passionate gardener and spent his last days in Los Angeles, a George Harrison memorial pine tree was planted at the Griffith Observatory in 2001; at the time of Harrison\u2019s death.\nThe memorial pine tree grew to reach over ten feet tall before a serious bark beetle infestation plagued Griffith Park last year; and wiped out Harrison\u2019s tree.\nA new young sapling has been planted in place of the memorial tree to memorialize the late Beatles star, and is marked with a small plaque at the bottom.\nBark beetles consist of some 6,000 different species of beetle that are characterized by their tendency to live, eat, and reproduce in both the living and dead tissue of trees. While some species attack and kill off living trees, the majority of bark beetle species tend to live and breed in dead, dying, or otherwise compromised trees.\nWhile bark beetles play a role in our ecosystem, assisting in the clearing out of dead wood, most are considered notorious pests that can wipe out entire parks or even forests. They can infest in large numbers, overwhelming a tree\u2019s defenses and kill it.\nHarrison eventually left the Beatles to pursue a solo career, and in 1988 he founded the successful group the Traveling Wilburys. At age 58 he passed away from lung cancer at the young age of 58.<|endoftext|>You\u2019ll recall hat I wrote to you a while back, forewarning of increasing prices for canned tuna, as I am in the import food business.\nproducts are imported.

        "passage": "-screens, and all of the side windows were equipped with S-screens (negatively charged at 4.2 and 2 kV, respectively). The ventilating fan was also covered with an electric field screen box to prevent pests from invading via the opening for the fan, especially when the fan was stopped. The second room had no anteroom; no screens were installed on the side windows and it served as a control. We examined the entry of insect pests into both rooms. Each experiment lasted 2 weeks, and six experiments were conducted in total. In the greenhouse, blue and yellow adhesive plates were hung at constant intervals to trap any pests that invaded from the outside. Whiteflies, tomato leaf-minor flies, and green peach aphids are attracted to the color yellow, while the western flower thrip prefers blue. The number of pests trapped by the adhesive plates was counted to determine the number of pests in the greenhouse. In this experiment, we also carefully surveyed individual tomato plants cultured in the screen-furnished room to check for insects that may have hidden under plant leaves.\nOver the course of the experiment, no green peach aphids or western flower thrips were found, while moderate to severe whitefly and tomato leaf-minor fly invasions were evident. As shown in Supplementary Table 3 (see  Appendix B), both types of pests were completely prevented from entering the screen-installed room in all experiments. These experiments clearly demonstrated the practicality of the electric field screens. The severity of the pest invasion was clear from the number of pests trapped by the yellow adhesive plates hung inside the control room, and the experimental room would have been invaded similarly without the preventive measures. These results again demonstrate the effectiveness of electric field screens for pest control.\nIn this greenhouse study, the installed electric field screens effectively excluded the pests, and no supplementary devices (i.e., the electrostatic insect sweeper and electrostatic flying insect catcher) were required. Nevertheless, supplementary devices are an emergency measure when pests evade other means of trapping.\n\nConclusions and Future Perspectives\nApplied electrostatic engineering has successfully managed pathogens and insect pests affecting agricultural crops at various stages of crop production and preservation. Electrostatic principles have been applied in diverse ways, including for capturing spores and insects by exploiting the attractive force generated in a static electric field (without electric discharge) (Matsuda et al., 2006;Kakutani et al., 2017;Nonomura et al., 2014a;Matsuda et al., 2012;Matsuda et al., 2011;Takikawa et al., 2015;Moriura et al., 2006aMoriura et al.,, 2006bNonomura et al., 2009), repelling insects via their aversion to electric fields Matsuda et al., 2011;Matsuda et al., 2015b), disinfecting bacterial and fungal pathogens using ozone produced through streamer discharge (Shimizu et al., 2007), instantaneously dislodging fungal pathogens from plants through exposure to a plasma stream produced via a corona discharge in the electric field, instantaneously pulverizing insects nesting in dried rice grains (Matsuda et al., 2018c), electrocuting virus-carrying mosquitoes in the screen by insect-mediated arch discharge (Kakutani et al., 2018), and negatively ionizing smoke particles in the ionic wind produced during corona discharge (Matsuda et al., 2018b). In this work, we used electrostatic devices to repel and capture insect pests, creating a pest-free space in a greenhouse with open windows. Based on these successful applications, we could realize a non-insecticidal pest control system for crop plants.\nThe electrostatic devices described here are patented inventions. The patent holders are Kindai University (Osaka, Japan), Kagome (Tokyo, Japan), Panasonic (Tokyo, Japan), and Osaka Prefecture (Osaka, Japan). Kindai University is in charge of managing the patent licenses and has prepared contracts for patent use. Contractors (including farmers) are allowed to make electric field screens (single-charged dipolar type) and related apparatuses (electrostatic insect sweeper, electrostatic flying insect catcher, electrostatic cabinet (Kakutani et al., 2017), and electrostatic seedling shelter (Takikawa et al., 2016)) for personal use or to produce and sell under specific agreements. Research that has a real impact on society has been our dream from the beginning. Therefore, the concepts and technologies originating from our university laboratory are made readily available to the public, in an effort to fulfill our mission of contributing to society by helping to solve real-world problems and move science forward. Our role will not change with greater recognition of this technology, and we will continue to research diligently and promote reliable techniques to improve the lives of others.<|endoftext|>Unlike Christmas or Easter or other holidays, Independence Day isn\u2019t usually associated with a barrage of thematic movies that turn into family viewing traditions.

I always have trouble uploading SVG files. Mostly because i design pretty complicated drawings. At first i always assumed the problem was i have to narrow points or to small spaces. But with my latest drawing, i just tried to cut it up or cover it up to see what area might be the issue. I discovered i can have a lot smaller spaces/gaps than i thought.\nWhat is your guys process or way of checking what is wrong with the SVG file? I thought i was pretty good with Adobe Illustrator after 20 years, but i still don\u2019t seem to be able to figure out how to get this to work.\nI have a script that detects paths smaller than \u201cX\u201d and i tried detecting gaps with live paint (and releasing the live paint), but nothing seems to fix it.\nAny help and advice for future projects would be appreciated, of course i have read the spreadshirt documentation about vector files.\nI have looked at your two sample files. The details are just way too small. Each flex print has to be screened and fixed manually - by hand - by a staff member. Every small detail that does not belong to the design is removed individually. That is simply impossible with so many very small details as in your graphic.\nYou not only have to observe the minimum line width, but also the minimum size for negative areas. These must not be too small either. In the example design, the thin contour lines between the two faces and the fine strokes on the chin and nose are too small. There are also some other problematic parts in your design.\nWhy don\u2019t you just upload such great designs as PNG files? Then you won\u2019t have any problems.\nOf course you can\u2019t change the colours afterwards in your Partnerarea, but you could simply upload 2 versions - one in white and one in black. With pixel graphics, everything with minimum sizes of details is obsolete.\nThank you for taking the time to look at it!\nI understand what you are saying, but i still don\u2019t understand what the difference is between the center area and the other detailed spots that do get approved. Is it because it\u2019s too much hard parts close to each other?\nAgain, thank you so much for taking the time to look at this and explain it to me! its a big help.\nFor the marketplace, almost everything is printed in DD anyway - no matter if it is a pixelfile or a vectorfile. The customer has no possibility to convert marketplace products to flex print. They only have the option in the Create Your Own Area. And you as a partner also have no option in the partner area to specify that the design is printed in flex print.\nConverting to PNG therefore makes sense and the argument for flexprint is obsolete.\nAh ok - so you are talking ybout the Create Your Own Area?\nThen it makes sense to use flexprint. But as mentioned the details are way to small. And sometimes the system also misses areas that normaly should be rejected - so its hard to compare when the system passes an area and when it refuses.\nBy making your designs more minimalistic and avoiding too small details, you avoid the problem. or you can switch to DD printing by uploading a pixel file.<|endoftext|>A NEW chapter in the 120-year history of Hinckley RFC will be written next weekend with the"

We trained subjects on a paradigm in which the horizontal target jumped vertically during the saccade. With training, the final position of the saccade moved toward the second target. However, saccades became increasingly curved, i.e., suboptimal, as oculomotor commands were corrected on-line to steer the eye toward the second target. The adaptive response had two components: (1) the motor commands that initiated the saccades changed slowly, aiming the saccade closer to the jumped target. The adaptation of these earliest motor commands displayed little forgetting during the rest periods. (2) Late in saccade trajectory, another adaptive response steered it still closer to the jumped target, producing curvature. Adaptation of these late motor commands showed near-complete forgetting during the rest periods. The two components adapted at different timescales, with the late-acting component displaying much faster rates. It appears that in controlling saccades, the brain relies on an internal feedback that has the characteristics of a fast-adapting forward model.\nOur motor commands are strongly influenced by feedback. Theory suggest that this feedback takes two forms: an external feedback through the sensory system, and an internal feedback that predicts the sensory consequences of motor commands through forward models (Wolpert et al., 1995). In actions such as reaching, walking, and speech that are heavily influenced by external feedback from one or more sensory modalities (Houde and Jordan, 2002; Vaziri et al., 2006), internal prediction and external feedback are combined to adjust the motor output in real time, making it exceedingly difficult to isolate the effects of forward models. An exception to this constraint is the saccade: rapid eye movements that redirect the fovea toward targets of interest. Typical saccades are too brief for visual feedback to influence saccade trajectory. Furthermore, proprioceptive signals from the eyes do not play any significant role in controlling saccade trajectories (Keller and Robinson, 1971; Guthrie et al., 1983). Thus, to ensure accuracy, the brain may \u201csteer\u201d the saccades by relying on an internal estimate of the state of the eye (e.g., position, velocity), derived from an efferent copy of ongoing motor commands (Robinson, 1975; Optican, 2005). Support for this idea comes from the observation that both natural (Quaia et al., 2000) and drug-induced (Jurgens et al., 1981) variability of saccade velocity and duration have little influence on saccade amplitude. That is, variability of motor commands that initiate saccades may be partially corrected via an internal feedback process that relies on efferent copy.\nHere, we conjectured that if a forward model exists in the saccadic system, then it should be able to adapt in response to persistent discrepancy between the observed and predicted sensory states. Experimentally, such discrepancy, or error, can be artificially induced by moving the target of a saccade intrasaccadically, so that at saccade termination the eye fails to land on target. Although it is well known that such error drives saccade adaptation (Hopp and Fuchs, 2004), we hypothesize that saccade adaptation is led by adaptation of the forward model. In particular, if the motor commands that move the eyes rely on this forward model, then its adaptation should leave its signature on saccade trajectories.\nTo predict what these trajectory changes might look like, we used stochastic optimal feedback control theory (Todorov, 2005) to model saccades. In this framework, given the estimated state of the eyes with respect to the target, motor commands are generated to minimize some cost. One component of the cost may be a measure of endpoint variability (Harris and Wolpert, 1998, 2006). Another component may be the value that the brain assigns to the visual stimulus, because rewarded stimuli tend to produce faster saccades (Takikawa et al., 2002). A balance between these factors nicely reproduces the velocities and durations that one typically observes in saccades to stationary targets. Here, we used this framework to make a number of predictions about how trajectories might change if the forward model that provides state estimation were to adapt to endpoint errors caused by intrasaccadic motion of the target. The theoretical predictions were particularly dramatic when the intrasaccadic target jump was perpendicular to the initial direction of the target. We used this \u201ccross-axis\u201d adaptation paradigm (Deubel, 1987; Frens and Van Opstal, 1994; Noto et al., 1999) to test the hypothesis that motor commands that produce saccades are fundamentally dependent on a forward model.\nWe used a directional scleral search coil system (Skalar Medical, Delft, The Netherlands) to record horizontal and vertical eye movements at 1000 Hz from either the right or the left eye (Robinson, 1963). Subjects sat in a dark room facing a vertical screen on which light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were presented. The seat and head position of the subject was adjusted using a laser projector so that the midpoint between the subject's eyes was at the center of the magnetic field and aligned to the LED located at the center of the vertical target screen (0\u00b0, 0\u00b0). Bite bars were used to minimize head movements.\nExperimental paradigm for cross-axis adaptation.\nEach experiment consisted of four blocks: oblique control trials, preadaptation catch trials, adaptation trials interspersed with catch trials, and postadaptation catch trials (Fig. 1A). We will explain each block below.\nExperimental paradigm. A, Chronology of the experiments. B, Target presentation sequence for oblique and catch trials. In oblique trials, targets were displayed randomly 15\u00b0 lateral to the center LED and 0, 1, 2, 3, or 5\u00b0 above (in the first quadrant) or below (in the third quadrant) the meridian. Each trial began with fixation (F) at the center LED (0\u00b0, 0\u00b0) for a random interval of 1\u20132 s, after which the center LED was extinguished and the target LED was turned on for 1 s. In catch trials, the target disappears at saccade onset. C, Target presentation sequence for a pair of adaptation trials during a counterclockwise adaptation experiment. Filled circles indicate currently illuminated LEDs, and open circles indicate previously illuminated LEDs. Arrowheads indicate when a saccade began. D, Target configurations for clockwise and counterclockwise cross-axis saccade adaptation experiments.\nTargets for oblique trials and adaptation trials lay either in the first and third quadrants or in the second and fourth quadrants of the visual space, depending on whether the target jump under investigation was in the counterclockwise or clockwise direction (Fig. 1D). Figure 1B illustrates oblique control trials for the counterclockwise adaptation experiment. The oblique trials consisted of two sets: 25 trials to five targets located in the first quadrant, five repetitions to each target, followed by another 25 trials to five targets located in the third quadrant, also five repetitions to each target. Target appearance within the set was random. The target locations were 15\u00b0 lateral to the center LED and 0, 1, 2, 3, or 5\u00b0 above (in the first quadrant) or below (in the third quadrant) the meridian. Each trial began with fixation at the center LED (0\u00b0, 0\u00b0) for a random interval of 1\u20132 s, after which the center LED was extinguished and the target LED was turned on for 1 s. The intertrial interval was 500 ms. During clockwise adaptation experiments, targets were presented in the second and fourth quadrants 15\u00b0 lateral to the center with vertical eccentricities of 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5\u00b0.\nIn a catch trial, the target LED was displayed, but after saccade initiation, it was extinguished so that the saccade would complete in darkness. The catch trial block contained 60 trials (Fig. 1B). On odd-numbered trials, the center fixation LED was turned on for a random period of 1\u20132 s; a target then appeared 15\u00b0 to either the left or the right. This target LED was extinguished when the subject began to saccade (gaze moved outside of a 2\u00b0 window surrounding the center fixation). The fixation target was turned back on 750 ms later. This relit target then became the fixation LED for the next trial. Thus, the odd-numbered catch trials were all centrifugal and began at the center LED, whereas the even-numbered catch trials were all centripetal and began at \u00b115\u00b0 lateral to the center. These centrifugal and centripetal trial pairs were repeated 15 times on each side of the center LED randomly during the catch trial block.\nTrials in the adaptation block were organized in centrifugal\u2013centripetal pairs. During a counterclockwise adaptation experiment (Fig. 1C), odd trials began with fixation at the center LED for 1\u20132 s. A target 15\u00b0 to the left or the right of the center then appeared (T1). As soon as the subject began to saccade, the target jumped 5\u00b0 vertically to a new location (T2). The jump direction was consistently counterclockwise to the orientation of T1, i.e., when T1 was at (15\u00b0, 0\u00b0), T2 was at (15\u00b0, 5\u00b0), and when T1 was at (\u221215\u00b0, 0\u00b0), T2 was at (\u221215\u00b0, \u22125\u00b0). The T2 LED was on for 1 s and then continued to stay on to serve as the fixation point for the centripetal\u2013even trial. T1 for these even trials were at either (0\u00b0, 5\u00b0) or (0\u00b0, \u22125\u00b0). Once the saccade toward T1 (primary saccade) began, T1 jumped to ("

The biochemical response in the form of mixed-type hepatocellular-cholestatic injury and the reported histological findings in the few reported cases with other SARMs indicate combined targeting of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes by the immune response, which can be explained by the idiosyncratic immune response [13].\nWe conclude that our patient suffered a DILI caused by the muscle-building supplement containing enobosarm. The laboratory findings on presentation suggested a hepatocellular pattern with predominant transaminase elevation. Our case report highlights the need for further study of the liver damage caused by SARMs in light of their increasing popularity and potential for misuse as body-building products.\nSARMs, such as enobosarm, are an emerging class of compounds that have the potential for both therapeutic and recreational use, but appear to carry a risk of liver injury.\nPatients presenting with abnormal liver enzymes should be asked about their use of supplements, particularly those patients involved in weight-lifting and muscle or body building.\nFurther research is needed to characterize the effects of enobosarm on the liver.\nThe authors have no financial disclosure to declare.\nThe patient\u2019s informed consent for publication was obtained.\nDW and SR provided patient care.

Effective lifetime of excited vibrational band instead of single rotational level, is used in the LIF model. And this is normally correct if RET process is fast, but still need to check if concentrations of quenching species such as H 2 O to OH is very high [54,[68][69][70]. Furthermore, the laser power needs to be kept low and linear LIF is achieved to avoid stimulated emission and large depletion of initial pumped state density.\nIn many cases the excitation radiations locate range of deep UV (e.g., <100 nm) and are strongly absorbed by ambient gaseous medium (e.g., air or water molecules), then two-photon excitation in the UV spectral range (>200 nm) can be applied for the same diagnostic purpose, namely the so-called two-photon absorption LIF (TA-LIF) [49]. Compared to single-photon LIF, TA-LIF is considerably less efficient and the excitation rate scales with the square of laser power. Normally higher laser power is required to produce detectable fluorescence intensity, but laser stimulated effects including photon-ionization, induced breakdown, stimulated emission, etc. needs to be avoided [71,72]. Table 3 lists excitation schemes of TA-LIF for various active atomic species in plasmas. An example of twodimensional distribution of atomic oxygen in an atmospheric-pressure plasma jet-source by TA-LIF is presented in Figure 4.\n\nAbsorption spectroscopy\nAnother important diagnostic technique for atmospheric-pressure plasmas is absorption spectroscopy (AS) [77]. Compared to LIF or OES approaches, AS is an in\n\nSpecies\nExcitation transition Fluorescence transition Calibration Ref.\nRayleigh of air [50][51][52][53][54] NO NO gas [55][56][57][58][59] Rayleigh [65,66]   situ and non-invasive technique probing absolute densities of interested species without need of extra calibration and independent on collisional quenching process. It relies on the Beer-Lambert law: where I s is the light intensity passing through sample, I 0 is the incident radiation, N is species density, \u03c3\u03bb \u00f0\u00deis the wavelength dependent absorption cross-section, and L is the absorption path-length. If probed species density is low, the absorption length is normally increased by using a multi-pass spectroscopic absorption cell where light reflects between two mirrors, e.g., the Herriott cell [78]. However, if for micro-plasmas this technique maybe not sensitive enough if species density is not high to obtain a distinct absorbance signal.\nThe sensitivity of absorption measurements is strongly dependent on the stability of used light source. Various types of light sources, narrow-band or broadband with wavelength range from VUV to mid-infrared, are applied together with high spectral resolution detection system such as spectrometer or FTIR. AS by laser light sources, particularly tunable diode-lasers or quantum cascade lasers are attractive light sources have been applied to measure species densities in micro-plasmas [8, 79,80]. These laser sources output specific wavelengths of large absorption cross-sections and enable fine scan of wavelength to obtain a clear absorption line profile, and from which species density and even gas temperature are able to be derived.\nWavelength selectivity is important in the implementation of AS technique as absorption may overlap by multi-species. And, it should be mentioned that absorption measurements yield line-integrated densities and spatial distribution is achievable by Abel inversion. Special efforts are required for non-uniform micro-plasmas by AS approach, since gas temperature and species density are spatially dependent. In this case broadband absorption can provide more details for deriving both the gas temperature and species density [81,82]. An example of OH density determination by broadband UV absorption in an atmospheric-pressure pin-to-water discharge is depicted in Figure 5 [83].\nAnother quite sensitive approach by using a cavity of two highly reflective mirrors is the cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) [84]. The laser pulse goesand-back in the cavity and that effectively enhances the absorption path length in the probed gas sample by several orders of magnitude. The time-decay of light intensity leaking from the cavity depends on the reflectivity of mirrors and species density in the cavity. Based on that the species density is able to be obtained with the known mirror reflectivity. In addition to the high sensitivity, compared to absorption spectroscopy, CRDS is independent on fluctuations of light intensity since a time constant rather than an absolute absorbance is measured. More details of CRDS technique are included in Refs. [84][85][86][87][88][89][90].\n\nSummary\nHigh-end diagnostic techniques have been applied to atmospheric-pressure plasmas. Even for highly transient non-uniform micro-plasmas, reliable insights of discharge properties are able to be achieved. This chapter includes several important advanced diagnostic approaches specifically for plasma parameters and reactive plasma species. Two approaches are suggested for a same diagnostic purpose, for example, the determination of gas temperature or electron density, and compared to ensure and increase the measurement accuracy, particularly for atmospheric-pressure plasmas. Other important plasma properties, such as densities of ion species and ion flux, surface charges, have been investigated as well and related diagnostic techniques can be found in above (review) references.

Viewing the film on the occasion of a new digital restoration by Grasshopper Film that begins a theatrical run at Film at Lincoln Center today, I was struck by the numerous billboards and posters placed atop taxi cabs that the film\u2019s lead character, William Keane (Damian Lewis), obliviously walks by. Short of pointing at the screen, Leonardo DiCaprio-style, as I noticed a poster for the upcoming season of The Sopranos or a cab ad advertising Bernadette Peters in Gypsy on Broadway, I appreciated the unintentional media ephemera that pops into the background of many of Kerrigan\u2019s frames\u2014such are the unexpected pleasures of filming in live locations!\nNot exactly Travis Bickle but at times on a similar astral plane, William Keane is an unsettling character that provided Damian Lewis with a bit of a career breakthrough. Indeed, the English actor was nominated for the 2005 Gotham Award for Breakthrough Actor (losing to Amy Adams in Junebug). And while the partnership between Lewis and Kerrigan would continue after Keane (the two reuniting on an episode of Homeland in 2012), the film represents another prodigious partnership between Kerrigan and executive producer Steven Soderbergh, that continues across film and television.\nThe week before the new restoration\u2019s theatrical release, I spoke with Kerrigan about the trickiness of shooting on film, the digital advantages of restoring older work and a Keane alternate cut that was edited by Soderbergh.\nFilmmaker: Before we get into Keane, I was curious about some general background information regarding where you were, career-wise, at that point in your life. Between Claire Dolan (1998) and Keane, I believe you made a film, In God\u2019s Hands, that had a narrative similar to what Keane would ultimately become. Of course, due to extensive damage to the original [camera] negative, In God\u2019s Hands was never officially released, but was the idea for Keane born out of your work on that previous film?\nKerrigan: I don\u2019t want to get into In God\u2019s Hands, to be really honest. It was a completely different story, although it did deal with a couple whose child had been abducted. In God\u2019s Hands was about a person who was religious and had subsequently lost their faith, a story about a family struggling to go through that. But with Keane, one of the most important elements in the writing and in the filmmaking was that I leave it up to the audience to decide for themselves whether Keane ever even had a daughter. I wouldn\u2019t say that the theme of child abduction runs through In God\u2019s Hands and Keane, but certainly, the idea of possible child abduction runs through it [laughs]. That\u2019s a similarity between the two films, but everything else is different. I can\u2019t imagine rem"

        "passage": " that the process begins with the activation of C/EBP\u03b2 and C/EBP\u03b4 induced in response to isobutylmethylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin, which, in turn, activate PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b11. The final stages of differentiation require the expression of genes that contribute to the maintenance of the adipocyte phenotype and function, such as the enzymes of lipid metabolism [27]. The expression of PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1 markedly decreased the expression of their downstream target genes involved in triacylglycerol metabolism including the fatty acid transporter CD36 and glucose transporter GLUT4. CD36, a target gene of PPAR-\u03b3, plays a key role in adipogenesis [28]. In agreement with these results, CD36 mRNA expression was also dramatically decreased in FCEE-treated cells.\nNext, we examined the expression of adiponectin and leptin. Adiponectin and leptin are two hormones secreted by white adipose tissue and regulate insulin sensitivity and energy balance [29]. Leptin is synthesized by adipocytes and is an important regulator of energy balance through its actions within the brain on appetite and energy expenditure. Adiponectin (also called Arcp30, GBP28, apM1, or AdipoQ) is produced by adipocytes, and plays an insulin-sensitizing role during glucose and lipid metabolisms of adipocytes, skeletal myocytes, and hepatocytes [30].\nC/EBP and PPAR expression depends on other genes, which are also essential to adipogenesis, such as cAMP responsive element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1c). Our results showed that FCEE increased the expression of SREBP-1c and its downstream target gene (FASN) in a dose-dependent manner. SREBP-1c was identified as a pro-adipogenic basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that induced PPAR\u03b3 expression and possibly generated an as-yet-unknown PPAR\u03b3 ligand [31]. SREBP-1c also mediated the induction of lipid biosynthesis by insulin in adipocytes that increased gene expression of the main lipogenic genes, such as fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase [32]. SREBP-1c, a transcription factor that controls fatty acid synthesis, was found to be a crucial transcriptional regulator involved in adipogenesis, which was associated with the production of an endogenous PPAR\u03b3 ligand that reinforces PPAR\u03b3 activity [33]. SREBP-1c expression significantly increased in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in response to insulin [32], and its transcriptional activity increased in response to oxidative stress [34]. The SREBP family has been found to directly regulate a group of genes involved in TG and cholesterol synthesis [35]. In previous studies, dominant negative SREBP-1c expression was found to inhibit preadipocyte differentiation and HLH overexpression to enhance the adipogenic activity of PPAR\u03b3 [36].\nMoreover, it has been proven that FAS, an important fatty acid synthesis enzyme, facilitates the synthesis of triglycerides from free fatty acid [37]; FAS expression was significantly lower in FCEE-treated cells.\nThe data suggest that the anti-adipogenic effect of FCEE was mediated by downregulation of the expression of transcription factors, such as PPAR\u03b3, C/EBP\u03b1, and SREBP-1c, during adipocyte differentiation.\nThis study showed that FCEE effectively reduced lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes through the inhibition of GPDH activity and downregulation of the expression of genes involved the adipogenesis process. These results suggested that this extract could be useful in the prevention or treatment of obesity. However, in vivo studies should be conducted to confirm the anti-obesity effect of FCEE in animal models.\nThis research was supported by a scholarship from the Japan Student Services Organization (JASSO).\n[1] Gambero, A. and Ribeiro, M.L.

        "passage": " with retinopathy.\nGinkgo has also been observed to lower blood glucose levels. It was studied in type 2 diabetics at a dose of 120 mg for three months. Ginkgo supplementation produced an increase in liver metabolism of insulin and oral hypoglycemic medications, which corresponded to a reduction in plasma glucose levels (Kudolo 2001). Type 2 diabetics with pancreatic exhaustion received the most benefit. Ginkgo does not appear to increase beta cell production; rather it enhances liver uptake of existing insulin, thereby reducing high insulin levels.\nIn published studies, blueberries block carbohydrate metabolism in the intestine by up to 90% compared with the prescription drug acarbose (Johnson 2011; Melzig 2007).\nAdditionally, blueberries have been shown to lower baseline blood sugar levels in those diagnosed with type 2 diabetes by 37% (Vuong 2009; Abidov 2006; Takikawa 2010).\nIn a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 32 obese, insulin-resistant (pre-diabetic) adult men and women drank smoothies made with freeze-dried blueberry powder for six weeks. A placebo control group consumed smoothies without blueberry extracts (Stull 2010). Fasting blood samples were obtained with a clamp technique considered state-of-the-art for precise determination of insulin sensitivity. With no changes in body weight or composition compared to controls, the blueberry group showed a statistically significant and much greater improvement in insulin sensitivity (22.2% plus or minus 5.8%) versus the placebo arm (4.9% plus or minus 4.5%).\nVaccinium myrtillus (bilberry). Studies of diabetic rats show that bilberry decreases vascular permeability (Cohen-Boulakia 2000). Studies of diabetic mice receiving an herbal extract containing bilberry demonstrated significantly decreased blood glucose levels (Petlevski 2001; Petlevski 2003).\nA double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of bilberry extract in 14 people with diabetic retinopathy or hypertensive retinopathy (damage to the retina caused by diabetes or hypertension, respectively) found significant improvements in the treated group (Bone 1997). Other open clinical trials in humans also showed benefits. A preliminary study of 31 people with retinopathy documented that bilberry reduced vascular permeability and reduced hemorrhage (Scharrer 1981).\nNOTE: Under no circumstances should people suddenly stop taking antidiabetic drugs, especially insulin. Individuals with diabetes should work closely with their healthcare provider before initiating a supplement regimen due to the potential risk of hypoglycemia.\nAdvanced glycation end products (AGEs) form when sugars bond with proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. This process contributes to the toxic effects of high blood sugar (Uribarri 2010; Ceriello 2012). Fortunately, several nutrients can counter these processes.\nBenfotiamine. Diabetes and obesity often induce a relative thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, which contributes to some of the damaging consequences of hyperglycemia (Beltramo 2008; Page 2011; Via 2012). Benfotiamine is a fat-soluble derivative of thiamine that has much greater bioavailability than other forms of thiamine, and is capable of reaching concentrations in the bloodstream several times that of orally administered thiamine (Greb 1998; Xie 2014). This unique form of vitamin B1 inhibits AGE formation, inflammation, and oxidative stress (Hammes 2003; Du 2008; Balakumar 2010; Shoeb 2012).\nA clinical trial in 165 patients with diabetic neuropathy found benfotiamine supplementation for six weeks reduced diabetic neuropathy pain. The benefits were clearer in subjects who consumed 600 mg of benfotiamine daily compared with those who took 300 mg, and in those who took benfotiamine for a longer period of time (Stracke 2008).\nIn a clinical trial in 13 subjects with type 2 diabetes, participants consumed a high-AGE meal before and after a 3-day course of benfotiamine, 1050 mg per day. The subjects\u2019 vascular and endothelial function were assessed after both high-AGE meals. Signs of vascular dysfunction were completely prevented by benfotiamine administration, and biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress were significantly reduced (Stirban 2006).\nClinical and animal studies have demonstrated the efficacy of benfotiamine in the treatment of diabetes-related neuropathy, kidney disease, peripheral vascular disease, and retinopathy (Stirban 2006; Chakrabarti 2011; Stracke 1996; Simeonov 1997; Winkler 1999; Haupt 2005; Nikolic 2009).\nCarnosine. The peptide carnosine is capable of inhibiting formation of AGEs and even reversing protein glycation (Boldyrev 2013; Seidler 2004). In a study on diabetic mice, carnosine supplementation increased plasma levels of carnosine 20-fold, reduced triglyceride levels by 23%, and increased stability of atherosclerotic lesions (Brown 2014). Carnosine has also been shown to improve the ability of cells to survive in the presence of high glucose concentrations, and improve wound healing in diabetic animals (Ansurudeen 2012). An animal model of diabetes showed carnosine supplementation improved the ability of red blood cells to change their shape as necessitated by mechanical forces encountered during blood flow; this process is impaired in diabetes, contributing to diabetic complications (Yapislar 2012).\nPyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate. Pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate is the active form of vitamin B6 and an effective anti-glycation agent (Nakamura 2007; di Salvo 2012). Treating 20 type 2 diabetics with 35 mg pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate along with 3 mg activated folate and 2 mg vitamin B12 improved skin sensation in diabetic peripheral neuropathy (Walker 2010). Supplementation with pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate significantly decreased high concentrations of glycation-induced toxic compounds in diabetic rats, and prevented the progression of diabetic neuropathy (Higuchi 2006; Nakamura 2007).\nIn addition to preventing protein glycation, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phophate is one of the most effective inhibitors of lipid (fat) glycation. Lipid AGEs are elevated in diabetic patients compared with healthy controls, and accumulation of lipid AGEs contributes to vascular diseases related to diabetes and aging (Miyazawa 2012; Bucala 1993).\nAMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) is a critical energy sensor in the body.  AMPK activation is a mechanism by which the preeminent antidiabetic drug metformin exerts some of its well-known metabolic benefits (Choi 2013; Yue 2014).\nGynostemma pentaphyllum. Gynostemma pentaphyllum (G. pentaphyllum) is a climbing vine of the family Cucurbitaceae (cucumber or gourd family) that is native to Asian countries including Korea, China, and Japan, where it is used as tea and in traditional medicine. Like metformin, gynostemma extract activates AMPK (Park, Huh 2014).\nIn animal and human cell cultures, extracts from G. pentaphyllum have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, reduce levels of glucose and cholesterol, enhance immune function, and inhibit cancer growth (Lu 2008; Yeo 2008; Megalli 2006; Liu, Zhang, 2014). In a randomized controlled trial, an extract from gynostemma modestly reduced body weight and fat mass in obese subjects (Park, Huh 2014). Results from another trial found gynostemma tea improved insulin sensitivity, and lowered fasting glucose nearly ten times more than placebo (Huyen 2013).\nIn a clinical trial involving 25 diabetics, a gynostemma extract was tested as add-on therapy to the sulfonylurea drug gliclazide. Reductions in plasma glucose and HbA1C were nearly three times greater in the gynostemma extract group compared with placebo. Gynostemma acted by increasing insulin sensitivity rather than stimulating insulin release. It also prevented weight gain and hypoglycemia, which are often associated with sulfonylurea drugs (Huyen 2012).\nIn a trial in participants with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, a condition strongly linked to insulin resistance, treatment with gynostemma extract, as an adjunct to diet, resulted in a significant reduction in liver enzymes and insulin levels, a decrease in body mass index, and increased insulin sensitivity (Chou 2006; Utzschneider 2006).\nHesperidin. Hesperidin and related flavonoids are found in a variety of plants, but especially in citrus fruits, particularly their peels (Umeno 2016; Devi 2015). Digestion of hesperidin produces a compound called hesperetin along with other metabolites. These compounds are powerful free radical scavengers and have demonstrated anti-inflammatory, insulin-sensitizing, and lipid-lowering activity (Li 2017; Roohbakhsh 2014). Findings from animal and in vitro research suggest hesperidin\u2019s positive effects on blood glucose and lipid levels may be related in part to activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway (Jia 2015; Rizza 2011; Zhang 2012). Accumulating evidence suggest hesperidin may help prevent and treat a number of chronic diseases associated with aging (Li 2017).\nHesperidin may protect against diabetes and its complications, partly through activation of the AMPK signaling pathway. Coincidentally, metformin, a leading diabetes medication, also activates the AMPK pathway. In a six-week randomized controlled trial on 24 diabetic participants, supplementation with 500 mg of hesperidin per day improved glycemic control, increased total antioxidant capacity, and reduced oxidative stress and DNA injury (Homayouni 2017). Using urinary hesperetin as a marker of dietary hesperidin, another group of researchers found those with the highest level of hesperidin intake had 32% lower risk of developing diabetes over 4.6 years compared to those"

        "passage": " it is important to harvest an amount of fat that is at least double the size of the perforation, because fat absorption is common [11].\nSaliba and colleagues have been advocates of hyaluronic acid use in TMP cases. Hyaluronic acid, a natural component of the extracellular matrix of many body tissues, is known for its role in the regeneration and regulation of the fibrous layer during the healing process of the perforated TM. In addition, it supports and regulates the formation of keratin and hyperplastic epithelial tissue during healing. It also stimulates a centripetal migration of the epithelial layer over the temporary fat graft support [10],[11]. Many studies have shown the advantages of applying local growth factors on the volume and survival of the fat graft. Adjunctives such as insulin, steroids, lidocaine, epinephrine, and selected \u03b21 blockers have been used to complement fat grafts to avoid its early absorption [3],[12]. We chose to complement the fat plug graft with PRP because an autologous product seemed the most natural, rather holistic approach.\nPRP is a biological product created by condensing platelets in vitro and activating the alpha granules in order to stimulate secretion of growth factors. As it is prepared from autologous blood, PRP is cheaper than growth factors and carries no risk of transmitting infection. Use of PRP in the closure of tissue defects, particularly bone, has been reported [13],[14].\nIn terms of graft healing, we achieved a 90% success rate in the patients who underwent fat plug myringoplasty plus PRP, which agrees with the work of Nakamura and colleagues.  The authors found that capillary formation was significantly higher in the PRP group [15],[16].\nAccording to our results, small-sized perforations do not benefit from PRP as do large and medium-sized perforations. Many surgeons restrict the use of fat plug myringoplasty to small-sized traumatic perforation; however, many authors believe that the fat graft just needs an oval surface to stick, regardless of size [17]. We found the use of PRP to have no effect on hearing.\nAlhabib and Saliba reported that complete closure was achieved in 18.1% of patients when using PRP. They abandoned the study due to the low success rate in patients having autologous PRP myringoplasty, albeit PTA was improved postoperatively in patients with closed TM [18].According to Maria and colleagues, the use of PRP during myringoplasty will prevent graft displacement. Their study evaluated tympanic perforation repairs positively with lower morbidity for the patient and a perforation seal guarantee [4].\n In most applications, significant resorption of the transplanted fat can be expected, and it should be compensated for accordingly by initial overcorrection [19],[20].\nWe found PRP to be a cheap and cost-effective platelet concentrate with an enriched growth factor. Topical autologous PRP application during fat plug myringoplasty is highly successful with no reported postoperative infections and minimal morbidity. It accelerates TM closure following fat plug myringoplasty and prevents graft displacement. It also improves the overall success rate of fat plug myringoplasty. PRP not only enhances the healing of chronic TMPs but also avoids infection and obviates the need for inner ear packing.\n1 Marx RE. Platelet-rich plasma.

The first is through the Bible Browser and the second is through a Morph Query Document. Both ways seem to be exposing bugs so I'll investigate further...\nLogan, I've created two threads concerning the problems I found with Bible Browser and Morph Query Documents. See this thread for the former and this one for the latter. Note: I posted in the beta forum since I'm running the beta version.\n... every time a proper name appears in that book. Is there a search that would allow me to do that?\nI have been using the @np search (All Morph Text in Old Testament in English Standard) as I am reading through the Old Testament. I wondered why some proper names are ignored.\nJoshua 2:12 does not find Reubenites or Gadites or God; and so on.\nI have had similar experience in the First Five books as well.\nI wondered why some proper names are ignored.\nKeep in mind that the morph is based on the Hebrew text. There could be occasional tagging errors (which should be reported), but most of what you're seeing is the mismatch between English and Hebrew (noun vs. adjective in many instances).\nThe examples you quote (and I assume you mean Joshua 1:12 not 2:12) have the words tagged as adjectives not nouns which is why the search doesn't find them.\nI don't know Hebrew so can't comment on whether that tagging is appropriate.<|endoftext|>We look forward to a great future as we continue to educate the public about these wonderful creatures.

        "passage": " meaning with a different backdrop. Likewise, as we listen to the stories from scripture we may find new meaning and understanding because we are in a different setting as we receive them. And certainly, the anxiety we are experiencing as we live through this pandemic will affect how we hear these stories as well.\nFrom the Hebrew, Hosanna is a contraction of two words: yaw-shah, meaning to save or deliver, and \u201cnaw\u201d meaning to implore or pray. So the translation of the shouts from the crowd might be: \u201cWe implore you to save us.\u201d One can see why, then, this word Hosanna has caught my attention. \u201cGod, please save us from this pandemic\u201d are the words on my lips every day. Has this been true for you? What have your prayers been like? What are you asking to be saved from?\nAs we read through the stories of Holy Week this week, one might wonder why Jesus didn\u2019t usher in salvation in the way his people wanted him to. Did not Jesus hear the cries of his people? So what kind of salvation was Jesus offering? And what does God save us from today? Does God hear our cries for salvation, for deliverance? And as Holy Week commences, what do the stories teach us about God and the work of God in the world and in our lives?\nWhat I discover again as I reread these stories from Holy Week is the powerful truth that God is with us\u2014the same powerful truth we heard at Christmas time as we read the birth narratives. Yet, how does God being with us save us? This is the Lenten mystery question of the week!!\nI think part of being saved involves a God who enters into the messiest places of our lives; those places that remind us of our vulnerability; those places where we slam into our limitations.\nTo be listened to and understood by a friend in a time of great need is to experience an incredible oneness which I believe, in part, is how God saves us. God is with us as we are with each other.\nWe know today that there are many for whom this time creates great need. One challenge during this time is how to \u201cbe with\u201d others as we distance ourselves physically from each other, but we are finding ways! We are calling one another, face timing one another, writing more emails, sending letters through the mail\u2014these are all ways we discover God in our midst and experience a fierce solidarity with one another. And as we share with one another perhaps we are being a bit more vulnerable, a bit more tender. These acts of connection should not be underestimated in their power. I spoke with a woman earlier this week, a member of our church. She does not have a computer so I told her I would send things to her through the mail. Her mom later told me that her daughter was so excited that I would be sending her mailings that she told her mom this at least three times in one phone conversation. Salvation comes as we care for one another.\nInstead of holding and waving palms for this Palm Sunday, I invite you to open up your hands and lay them on your lap, palms facing upward. Our open palms remind us of our vulnerability, of the suffering and pain we are living through and holding, of so many using their hands, minds, and bodies on the frontlines of this pandemic. And as we look at our palms we speak from the deep, honest places within us and ask God, \u201cSave us\u2026please, save us\u201d? As we begin Holy Week, may we, as we read the stories from Scripture, remember Christ whose life, death, and resurrection shows us how to live, how to be free, and how to be saved.

One of these complex challenges is the management of information. In an attempt to mitigate these challenges, NGOs are increasingly collaborating through inter-organizational structures such as collaboration bodies to find mechanisms to coordinate information technologies. These collaboration bodies facilitate four kinds of \u201ccross\u201d collaboration; 1) cross organization, 2) cross border, 3) cross levels, and 4) cross technology. Within each collaboration body the role and function of a project also takes on special significance as much of the cross collaboration activities are channeled through projects that cross all four types of collaboration. In this paper we examine four case studies set in two collaboration bodies focused on IT in the humanitarian sector.\nBajpai, Kartikeya; Tchouakeu, Louis-Marie Ngagamassi; Maitland, Carleen; Zhao, Kang; and Tapia, Andrea H., \"Crossing Borders, Organizations, Levels and Technologies: IS Collaboration in Humanitarian Relief\" (2010).

Going by how the administrator turn governor is being endorsed from different quarters in APC fold and beyond for another term, it will not be surprising if he eventually emerges as APC flag bearer through consensus, to slug it out with opponents at the polls in due time.\nHowever, if information reaching JustNews is anything to go by, Governor Ambode may have to slug it out with a formidable opponent at the polls in the person of PDP top shot, Engineer Adedeji Doherty. Doherty, dependable sources revealed has been under pressure to give running in the next gubernatorial election a consideration.

        "passage": "). Acetaminophen glucuronide is a substrate for Mrp3, the efflux transporter for organic anions localized to the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes, that is primarily responsible for excreting glucuronide conjugates and bile acids into sinusoidal blood (Konig et al., 1999; Xiong et al., 2002). Consistent with the increase in the rate constant governing basolateral excretion of acetaminophen glucuronide, Mrp3 protein levels are up-regulated by at least an order of magnitude in Mrp2-deficient rats (Xiong et al., 2002). The lack of change in the rate constant governing the basolateral excretion of AS in TR- rat IPLs suggests that Mrp3 is not the primary mechanism of AS basolateral excretion.\nTwo potential mechanisms could explain the lack of agreement between expression levels of Mrp3 and the rate constant governing basolateral excretion of AS: 1) AS passively diffuses across the basolateral membrane into sinusoidal blood, and 2) AS basolateral excretion is mediated primarily by a transporter whose expression is unchanged in TR- rat liver. Although evidence exists for passive diffusion of acetaminophen, a relatively lipophilic compound (log D = 0.34, pH = 7.4), through the plasma membranes of cells, the hydrophilic sulfate metabolite (log D = -3.90, pH = 7.4) is too polar to passively diffuse through the plasma membrane. In fact, uptake of acetaminophen into hepatocytes is passive and instantaneous, in contrast to hepatic uptake of AS, which has been characterized as carrier-mediated and fairly insignificant in hepatocytes (Iida et al., 1989). This finding was confirmed by perfusion of the liver with preformed AS, where very poor basolateral membrane permeability of AS resulted in the lack of appreciable hepatic uptake (Goresky et al., 1992). In the present study, MDR1-MDCKII cell monolayer flux of AS was small; apparent permeability values were similar in the basolateral-to-apical and apical-to-basolateral directions, GF120918-independent, and comparable to those of the paracellular marker mannitol, indicating that the cell monolayer represents a diffusional barrier for AS.\nIn addition to Mrp3, other transport proteins are present on the basolateral membranes of hepatocytes, including several members of the multidrug resistance-associated protein family, bidirectional organic anion-transporting polypeptides, and the organic anion transporters, whose physiological roles in the liver are not yet fully understood (Chandra and Brouwer, 2004). For example, Mrp4 is a transporter localized to the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes that has high affinity for sulfated bile acids (Rius et al., 2003; Zelcer et al., 2003). Unlike Mrp3, Mrp4 efficiently transports sulfate conjugates of steroids (Zelcer et al., 2003). Bidirectional organic anion-transporting polypeptides are expressed on the hepatic basolateral membrane, where they mediate hepatic uptake of structurally diverse substrates, including sulfated steroids (Chandra and Brouwer, 2004). Hepatic basolateral efflux of AS could be mediated by the organic anion-transporting polypeptides, given their bidirectional activity and affinity for sulfate conjugates. Organic anion transporters are expressed in the liver, where they are thought to mediate hepatic uptake of organic anions, including sulfated steroids; however, potential involvement of these transporters in hepatic basolateral excretion remains to be investigated (Chandra and Brouwer, 2004). Given that AS is not adequately lipophilic to passively diffuse through the plasma membrane, and that the transport characteristics of AS are not in agreement with Mrp3 expression, basolateral excretion of AS may be mediated by another transporter, whose expression is maintained in livers of TR- rats.\nIn conclusion, biliary excretion of AS is mediated primarily by Mrp2 and, to a lesser extent, by Bcrp1. Sulfation of acetaminophen appears to be up-regulated in Mrp2-deficient TR- rat livers. The absence of change in the rate constant governing basolateral excretion of AS in IPLs from Mrp2-deficient rats, which have highly upregulated Mrp3, suggests that Mrp3 does not mediate basolateral excretion of AS.\nBooth CL, Brouwer KR, and Brouwer KL (1998) Effect of multidrug resistance modulators on the hepatobiliary disposition of doxorubicin in the isolated perfused rat liver.

The most frequent cause of disturbance of motor rotation at this moment is the induced voltage caused by long wiring routing.\nThe wiring among Volume Dia. control unit motor should be minimized as much as possible. Also, it is good to twist pair with the 0 V signal line paired with the signal. If you are using shielded wires, it may become better just to change the way to handle the shield (disconnect to ground for example).\n[C.E.2] Even if control is applied, it is impossible to suppress outer diameter fluctuation...\nFirst of all, please understand that there are outer diameter fluctuations that can be controlled by the Dia. control unit and that can not be controlled.\nBasically it is impossible to control the outer diameter fluctuation with a period shorter than the distance from the extruder to the Laser Micrometer. It seems that this is often caused by uneven extrusion rotation and slipping of winding pulley, etc.\nThe control in the outer diameter control unit works effectively for long time period fluctuations due to changes in the state of kneading of the material, temperature change, clogging of the mesh of the extrusion head part, etc.\nBesides, there are cases where there is a problem with how to set the outside diameter control unit. Please check the setting once again according to the operation manual.\nThere is a lot of cases that become uncontrollable due to the communication speed difference by exchanging Laser Micrometer combined with the outer diameter control unit DAC+88.\nIf the model of the Display unit of the Laser Micrometer is the same, and if it becomes uncontrollable, please check the state of the setting switch on the back of the previously connected display unit.\nPlease set according to the table below, If you could not understand the previously connected display unit.\n\u203b Please swipe right.\n\uff0a To set / check the communication speed of DAC+88, turn off the power switch and hold down the \"MODE\" button and turn on the power switch.\nAfter setting, turn off the power switch, set it for a few seconds and turn on the power, the setting will be reflected.\nIn the start-up process with the automatic start-up unit, if the outer diameter does not approach the set value to some extent, stop the start-up (= maintaining the line speed) and repeat the control until the outer diameter improves. In order to know exactly how the outer diameter changed after fine adjustment of the motor rotation speed based on the measurement value of the Lasr Micrometer, it is necessary to wait until the wire from the extruder pass through the Laser Micrometer. Therefore, at the stage where the line speed is slow, it takes time to know exactly how the outside diameter changed after fine adjustment of the motor rotation speed, so the rise at low speed is slow if the outside diameter does not match.\nThe solution approach to this problem is as follows.\nThe best way to solve this problem is to bring the scanning unit of the Laser Micrometer as close as possible to the extruder. However, it is necessary to clear the problem of steam and heat.\nIt is also necessary to improve the linearity of the extruder motor and winding motor. Equipments that have the same outer diameter even at low speed operation and at high speed operation at the same extrusion and winding ratio is ideal.\nAlthough there are ways to tune so as to improve even a little by the parameters of the automatic startup unit in addition to the time and skill being required, even if tuning it, the outside air temperature and the state of the resin inside the extruder etc., conditions may change due to influence.\nAt low speed, it may not be good as a product due to other factors even if the outer diameter is good. In such cases it is better to raise the line speed at once to the point where you can take the good product.\n[C.E.52] It does not enter AUTO by automatic start-up...\nThe possible causes are as follows.\nRS-Connection failure of RS-232C.

Inspired by the generated sharp edges of superpixel blocks, we employ superpixel to guide the information passing within feature map. Simultaneously, the sharp boundaries of the blocks also restrict the message passing scope. Specifically, we average features that the superpixel block covers within feature map, and add the result back to each feature vector. Further, to obtain sharper edges and farther spatial dependence, we develop a multiscale superpixel module (MSP) by a cascade of different scales superpixel blocks. Our method can be served as a plug-and-play module and easily inserted into any segmentation network without introducing new parameters. Extensive experiments are conducted on three strong baselines, namely PSPNet, DeeplabV3, and DeepLabV3+, and four challenging scene parsing datasets including ADE20K, Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC, and PASCAL Context. The experimental results verify its effectiveness and generalizability.\n\n\nIntroduction\nSemantic segmentation is a fundamental and challenging problem of computer vision, whose goal is to assign a semantic category to each pixel of the image. It is critical for various tasks such as autonomous driving, image editing, and robot sensing. Recently, with the rapid development of deep learning, fully convolutional (Long, Shelhamer, and Darrell 2015) based methods have been proposed to address the above task. These methods have achieved significant performance on various benchmarks (Zhou et al. 2017;Cordts et al. 2016;Everingham et al. 2015;Mottaghi et al. 2014). However, many researchers have also noticed that segmented boundary is of low quality to some extent. Therefore, many efforts are devoted to improving the performance of boundary segmentation. DenseCRF (Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl and Koltun 2012), as a classic method, uses color and position relationship of the original pixels of the image to refine the segmentation results containing poor boundary (Chen et al., 2017aZheng et al. 2015). However, DenseCRF usually serves as a postprocessing module, which makes it not closely integrated with the CNN structure, and has a weak effect on optimizing the feature representation of edge points. Afterward, some works (Wang et al. 2018a;Huang et al. 2019) leverage attention mechanism of the high-level features to construct more reliable context information between the edge points and the internal points of the object. Some other works (Bertasius, Shi, and Torresani 2016;Takikawa et al. 2019;Yuan et al."

In contrast, it has been experimentally proven that the solubility of CO2 and N2 in thermoplastic polymers follows Henry's Law (i.e., the gases can be dissolved in polymers even below the critical pressure).3, 4 It is therefore theoretically possible to conduct physical foaming even when the saturation pressure (which corresponds to the dissolved PBA concentration) is lower than the critical pressure. An injection-molding machine without a high-pressure pump system, however, has not yet been developed.\nIn our work,5 we have thus developed a new foam injection-molding approach (which does not include an SCF pump unit) for the production of microcellular foams. We simplify the injection-molding process by directly delivering the PBA (i.e., CO2 or N2) from their gas cylinders into the molten polymer. This delivery takes place through an injection valve, which we can control by using a specifically designed operation sequence and screw configurations.\nOur foam injection-molding apparatus is illustrated in Figure 1. It includes a vent hole, with a venting vessel, in the middle of the machine. Through this venting hole, the excess PBA gas (i.e., the residual PBA that exists as a gas in the molten polymer) can be discharged from the molten polymer to the atmosphere. Alternatively, it can be used to introduce additional PBA gas to the molten polymer (when the PBA concentration in the polymer is below the saturation point). Specifically, we can adjust the concentration of the PBA dissolved in the molten polymer by tuning the pressure in the venting vessel. We manipulate the pressure of the venting vessel by using a back pressure regulator at the end of the discharge line.\n(a) Schematic diagram of the novel foam injection-molding machine (i.e., which does not include a supercritical fluid pump unit). N2: Nitrogen. CO2: Carbon dioxide. P: Pressure indicator. (b) Photograph of the physical blowing agent (PBA) delivery system, which consists of an injector valve and a vent vessel.\nScanning electron microscope (SEM) images of core-back foam injection-molded products that we fabricated with our technology are shown in Figure 2. We prepared these foams at three different expansion ratios (2, 3, or 5). In addition, we used either CO2 or N2 as the PBA, an injector valve opening time of 0.2 seconds, a vent vessel pressure of 5MPa, and a secondary pressure of 8MPa in the gas cylinders. These SEM images show that the cell size of the foams is about the same, or less, than that of foams we obtained with a conventional foam injection-molding approach. We have thus demonstrated that our foam injection-molding machine and method can be used to successfully produce microcellular foams.\nScanning electron microscope images of the core layer in core-back foam injection-molded products. These images were obtained from the direction perpendicular to the core-back direction of the foam. The foams were prepared using either N2 or CO2as the PBA, and with an expansion ratio of 2, 3, or 5. The average cell size and foaming temperature for each sample are given in the bottom and top left corners of each image, respectively.\nBy delivering the PBA only through the vent hole, we can also produce microcellular foams with our system. An example of a polypropylene injection-molded product and its corresponding microcellular foam are shown in Figure 3. We prepared this microcellular foam by delivering air through the vent vessel and hole and into the molten polymer, with the injector valve completely closed. The air was provided from an air compressor, in which air is simply compressed from atmospheric pressure to 4MPa. Through our process, the size of the original disk-shaped plate\u2014with a diameter of 100mm and a thickness of 1mm\u2014was expanded to have a thickness of 2mm. In addition, the plate became white in color because of reflection from the microscale bubbles.\nA polypropylene (PP) injection-molded product (left) and its microcellular foam (right). Both plates have a diameter of 100mm. The non-foamed and foamed products have a thickness of 1 and 2mm, respectively.\nIn summary, we have developed a new injection-molding system, without an SCF pump unit, for the fabrication of microcellular polymer foams. In our technique, we can produce stable microcellular foams with the use of non-supercritical N2, CO2, or compressed air as the physical blowing agent. We have thus demonstrated that the pressurization of N2 or CO2 to a supercritical state is not necessary for successful microcellular injection molding. In our upcoming work, we will be advancing this technology by optimizing the design of the screws and the performance of the vent-hole PBA delivery. This will allow us to easily convert conventional injection-molding machines to our system design, at low cost.\nTechnology Development Department, Hitachi Maxell, Ltd.\nInjection Molding Machine Division, Japan Steel Works Ltd.\nMasahiro Ohshima is a professor and the vice dean of the Faculty of Engineering at Kyoto University.\nJ.

After three washes with TBS-T, the blots were incubated with horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated immunoglobulin G (IgG) for 1 h at room temperature and chemiluminescence was detected with ECL Western blotting substrate (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized in Polaroid film.\nTransient transfection was performed using PolyJet DNA transfection reagent (SignaGen Laboratories, Ijamsville, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Briefly, RAW264.7 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and incubated overnight. Then, plasmid mixtures containing 1 \u03bcg of pNF-\u03baB-Luc plasmid and 0.1 \u03bcg of pRL-null vector were transfected for 24 h. After transfection, cells were pre-treated with the extracts for 2 h and then co-treated with LPS for an additional 15 h. The cells were harvested in 1 x luciferase lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was measured and normalized to the pRL-null luciferase activity using a dual-luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).\nA statistical analysis was performed with the Student\u2019s unpaired t-test, with statistical significance set at * P < 0.05.\nUnder stimulation, macrophages-generated NO plays an important role in inflammatory response. Thus, we used the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 cells for evaluating anti-inflammatory effect of the part of A. distichum. To determine if the parts of A. distichum could reduce NO generation by LPS, RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with the extracts from the parts of A. distichum (EAFAD) for 2 h and then co-treated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for the additional 18 h. As shown in Fig. 1, treatment of LPS without EAFAD induced NO overproduction in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, while pretreatment of all EAFADs suppressed LPS-mediated NO overproduction. Among EAFADs, the inhibitory effect of NO production was highest in the treatment of EAFAD-L (extracts from the leaf of A. distichum). Thus, we chose EAFAD-L for further studies.\nFig. 1Effect of EAFAD on NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. RAW264.7 cells were pre-treated with EAFAD at the indicated concentrations for 2 h and then co-treated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for the additional 18 h. After treatment, NO production was measured using the media and Griess reagent. DMSO was used as a vehicle. Values given are the mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3). *p < 0.05 compared to LPS treatment without EAFAD. EAFAD-F, EAFAD-L and EAFAD-B means the ethyl acetate fraction from the flower (EAFAD-L), leaf (EAFAD-L) and branch (EAFAD-B) of A. distichum.\nSince NO production is regulated by iNOS expression, the effect of EAFAD-L on iNOS expression was evaluated by Western blot and RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1A, LPS overexpression was detected in the cells stimulated LPS alone. However, EAFAD-L inhibited iNOS expression in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. For the further study for evaluating whether inhibitory effect of EAFAD-L against the expression of iNOS protein is mediated from regulating iNOS transcription, we also determined the mRNA level of iNOS regulated by EAFAD-L in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, the treatment of EAFAD-L attenuated the mRNA expression of iNOS. These data indicates that EAFAD-L may reduce iNOS expression through suppressing iNOS transcription.\nFig. 2Effect of EAFAD-L on iNOS expression in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. For Western blot (A), cells were pre-treated with indicated concentrations of EAFAD-L for 2 h and then co-treated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for an additional 15 h. DMSO was used as a vehicle. Cell lysates (30 \u03bcg) were resolved by 10% SDS\u2013PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with antibodies against iNOS. The proteins were then visualized using ECL detection. \u03b2-actin was used as an internal control. For RT-PCR (B), cells were pre-treated with indicated concentrations of EAFAD-L for 2 h and then co-treated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for an additional 15 h. Total RNA was isolated and RT-PCR was performed for iNOS. GAPDH was used as an internal control for RT-PCR.\nTo elucidate the effect of EAFAD-L on NF-\u03baB activation, we firstly carried out a Western blot for I\u03baB-\u03b1 degradation in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, LPS induced I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation and subsequent I\u03baB-\u03b1 degradation at 15 min after the stimulation. However, pretreatment of EAFAD-L blocked LPS-induced I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation in a dose-dependent manner.\nFig. 3.Inhibitory effect of EAFAD-L against NF-\u03baB activation. (A, B) Cells were pre-treated with indicated concentrations of EAFAD-L for 2 h, and then co-treated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for an additional 15 min (for Western blot of I\u03baB-\u03b1 and p-I\u03baB-\u03b1) or 30 min (for Western blot of p65).
