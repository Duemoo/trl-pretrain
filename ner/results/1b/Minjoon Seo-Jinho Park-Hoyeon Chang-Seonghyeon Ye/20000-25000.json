Therefore, we believe that this VQA model might rely too heavily on the image feature and learned to map the image feature with the answer space but it does not truly understand the question. Additionally, for the question that requires stronger reasoning ability and image with many texts, such as the third sample in Fig. 10, \u2018\u4f1f\u4e1a\u6c34\u7535\u5b89\u88c5\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u4eba\u662f\u8c01? (Who is the contact person for Weiye Hydropower Installation?)\u2019, none of the models predict the answer correctly.\nWe have described a new bilingual scene text+evidence VQA dataset named STE-VQA that is annotated with both English and Chinese QA pairs. Three related challenges are proposed, namely Cross Language, Localization and Traditional that are designed to evaluate the generalization of VQA models. An evidence-based measure of an algorithm\u2019s capacity to reason is also proposed that requires the VQA model to provide a bounding box of the predicted answer. This metric aims to uncover whether the VQA model learns deeper relationships between text and image content, rather than overfitting to a pre-defined dictionary. Future work includes extending the proposed EvE metric to existing VQA datasets in the hope that it might improve generalization and thus the practicality of VQA technologies.\n[1] Aishwarya Agrawal, Dhruv Batra, Devi Parikh, and Aniruddha Kembhavi.

        "passage": " negative spans can be better divided with the correct answer \u201cJerusalem\u201d. This shows that SCL in our KECP framework is reliable and can improve the performance for EQA.\nThe Accuracy of Answer Generation. A major difference between previous works and ours is that we model the EQA task as text generation. Intuitively, if the model correctly generates the first answer token, it is easy to generate the remaining answer tokens because of the very small search space. Therefore, we analyze how difficult it is for the model to generate the first token correctly. Specifically, we check whether the generated first token and the first token of the ground truth are within a fixed window size nw. As shown in Table 5, we find the accuracy of our method is lower than RoBERTa-base Liu et al. (2019) when nw=1. Yet, we achieve the best performance when increasing the window size nw to 5. We think that our KECP can generate some rehabilitation text for the answer. For example in Figure 4, the PLM may generate \u201cthe conquest of Jerusalem\u201d rather than the correct answer with single token \u201cJerusalem\u201d. This phenomenon reflects the reason why we achieve lower accuracy when nw=1. But, we think that the generated results are still in the vicinity of the correct answer.\nTable 5: The accuracy of predicting the first [MASK] in the query prompt with full training samples for each task. #nw denotes the window size.\nTo bridge the gap between the pre-training and fine-tuning objectives, KECP views EQA as an answer generation task. In KECP, the knowledge-aware prompt encoder injects external domain-related knowledge into the passage, and then enhances the representations of selected prompt tokens in the query. The span-level contrastive learning objective is proposed to improve the performance of EQA. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. In the future, we will i) further improve the performance of KECP by applying controllable text generation techniques, and ii) explore the prompt-tuning for other types of MRC tasks, such as cloze-style MRC and multiple-choice MRC.\nBrown et al.

A committee led by Councilwoman Jeanne Robb is working to define, via zoning, an \u201cembedded commercial district\u201d. These are the small business districts in the middle of residential neighborhoods. The plan is to further limit MMJ operations in those districts. WHNA members should phone or email Councilwoman Sandoval to find out whether the district at 32nd and Lowell will be included and to voice their opinions on the matter.\nAs new zoning was implemented in residential areas over the past two years, deadlines for using the previous zoning were included in the adoption ordinances. Most of those deadlines have now passed but outstanding permits based on the old zoning may not have been cancelled. The planning department is slowly working through that backlog. If you have questions about properties that may have permits that have exceeded their life expectancy, bring those to the attention of Councilwoman Sandoval\u2019s office to expedite a proper conclusion.<|endoftext|>The nose of cats: pay attention to your changes!\nIs it normal for a cat to have a dry nose? Why do cats get their nose wet? Around the nose of cats circulates the same myth as in the case of dogs and is none other than to assume that, by touching it, you can determine temperature of the animal and, therefore, its state of health.\nThis myth is so widespread among cat caregivers that we are going to dedicate this Animal Expert article to explain where this idea may have come from and what does it mean, really, the nose when assessing the health status of our cat. Do you think it is normal for a cat to have a dry nose? Keep reading!\nIt is true that, on a regular basis, touch a cat's nose We will feel it wet and cold. But it is also normal for the cat to have a dry nose, without implying any pathology or, therefore, being considered an alarm signal. So why does my cat have a dry nose? Because the nose will change its state throughout the day depending on the environment.\nFor example, if our cat is sunbathing or is near a source of heat, it is likely that its nose is dry and hot, without involving anything more than a reflection of the environment, without relation to its physical state. Therefore, the answer to our question is yes, that is, yes It is normal for a cat to have a dry nose. So why is it said that a dry nose is synonymous with a sick cat? We see it in the next section.\nWe have said that it is normal for a cat to have a dry nose, but it is also true that a sick cat is likely to have a dry and hot nose. Perhaps from this assessment derives the myth that relates the dryness of the nose with the pathology. To determine if our cat is sick or not we should look at other symptoms, not just the state of his nose.\nFor example, if our cat is decayed and has a dry nose, it may be yes have a fever and is suffering some pathological process. But to know its temperature the only reliable way is to measure the temperature of the cat using a thermometer which, in the cat, must be put in the rectum.\nPerhaps because of the difficulty of this maneuver, most caregivers prefer that it is the veterinarian who checks the temperature. For those who take it at home it is important to know that the normal temperature of cats is between 37.8 and 39.2 \u00b0 C.\nIn the same way that a dry and hot nose does not imply fever, it is not synonymous with dehydration. If we want to check the hydration status of our cat, the easiest and most effective way to do so is to watching your skin. If we stretch the cross zone, in a well hydrated cat it returns to its place immediately. On the other hand, if the skin keeps the crease and does not get smoothed, we will be facing dehydration. Of course, both fever and dehydration are veterinary consultation reason.\nCracks, grooves, peeling and / or injuries without bleeding of that style.\nBlack crust on the cat's nose.\nWounds, even if they are small.\nSecretions, of any color and consistency. Sometimes it can be a small amount of mucus that remains dry around the nostrils.\nAll these signs are going to require veterinary review since they can indicate that our cat is suffering from a respiratory condition such as a rhinotracheitis (viral infection), a dermatological problem or even a carcinogenic process.\nIt is important to highlight that most cats have the pink noseHowever, it may happen that there is a color change in the cat's nose or that the cat's nose itself turns white. Although at first it is not an indication of disease, whenever it is observed accompanied by other symptoms you should consult with our trusted veterinarian.\nIf you want to read more articles similar to Is it normal for a cat to have a dry nose?, we recommend you go to our Other health problems section.\nNormally, when from one day to another you notice that Your cat's nose has a wound, possibly have been caused by an external factor. It might have been done a scratch himself or another cat In a fight.\nIn that case it will be important to disinfect the wound, but also go to the veterinarian. Remember that If a stray cat has attacked your pet, it may have infected feline AIDS.\nThat your cat has the dry truffle does not have to mean that he is sick, or have a fever if it is also hot.\nTo the cats they love rubbing against things and that can make your nose dry or wet for a moment, as if they clean themselves with their legs.\nChanges in temperature when going outside can cause these same effects, but in none of the cases does it have to mean anything serious.\nHowever, If these symptoms recur continuously and, in addition, you notice changes in your cat's habits, there may be a problem That needs veterinary attention. You must be very aware of this!\nThe truffles of the pussycat They can be of different colors depending on the breed.\nIt may happen that the cats' nose changes color, especially if it is light in color, to a more intense tone. This can simply mean a variation of the cat's blood pressure, but"

Neuchatel Junior College and Inter Community School Zurich brought 28 players to compete against the Tigers. The Singles tournament results were solid for the Lady Tigers, who won the event the past two years. Captain MV Ramos '19 and teammate Margarita Ukleina '19 dominated their matches in the pool play. Later on, they would find themselves fighting it out in the championship match, with Uklieina edging out Ramos by two points. Newcomers Heather Hines '19 and Hajir Qureshi '20 also proved that they had the skills and determination. Each won important team points by beating opponent after opponent. In the Doubles tournament, Ukleina and Ramos came from behind to defeat rival ICSZ and claim the gold medal. At the end, with a combined team effort, the Lady Tigers remained the undefeated champions for the third straight year.\nIn the Boys tournament, returners Matt Meng '21, Minjoon Seo '19, and Giulio Bianco '21 showed off their smashes, fake shots, and consistency in each of their pool play games and finished at the top of their groups. Meng continued his winning streak all the way to the finals, where he lost by a narrow margin to his ICSZ opponent. Seo and Bianco were tested in the playoffs and endured some long rallies and games. All the players got some great opportunities and were able to push themselves on the court and support one another throughout the day. The boys ended the tournament with a solid 2nd-place finish.\nCongrats to all the players. The next competition will be in Zurich as ICSZ will host its invitational after the Winter Holiday.<|endoftext|>// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\n\npragma solidity 0.6.2;\n\nimport |||EMAIL_ADDRESS||| import \"./ERC165.sol\";\nimport \"./ERC721Enumerable.sol\";\n\ncontract ERC721Metadata is ERC165, ERC721Enumerable {\n    string private _name;\n    string private _symbol;\n    string private _baseURI;\n\n    // mapping Token ID => Token URI\n    mapping(uint256 => string) private _tokenURIs;\n\n    /*\n     *     bytes4(keccak256('name()')) == 0x06fdde03\n     *     bytes4(keccak256('symbol()')) == 0x95d89b41\n     *     bytes4(keccak256('tokenURI(uint256)')) == 0xc87b56dd\n     *\n     *     => 0x06fdde03 ^ 0x95d89b41 ^ 0xc87b56dd == 0x5b5e139f\n     */\n    bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC721_METADATA = 0x5b5e139f;\n\n    constructor(\n        string memory name,\n        string memory symbol,\n        string memory baseURI\n    ) public {\n        _name = name;\n        _symbol = symbol;\n        _baseURI = baseURI;\n\n        _registerInterface(_INTERFACE_ID_ERC721_METADATA);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the token name.\n     */\n    function name() external view returns (string memory) {\n        return _name;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the token symbol.\n     */\n    function symbol() external view returns (string memory) {\n        return _symbol;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the base URI set via {_setBaseURI}.\n     */\n    function baseURI() external view returns (string memory) {\n        return _baseURI;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns an URI for a given token ID\n     * Throws if the token ID does not exist.

As we mentioned, it's best to attempt to get standard coverage first because you can save money and get better protection than you could with a non-standard policy.\nWe've provided you with some companies that offer non-standard insurance for different situations. However, there may be alternative options within your state. Also, some non-standard property insurance companies focus on a specific type of coverage, so you may need to supplement your standard policy.\nFor example, in Texas, homes on the Gulf Coast are often denied wind and hail claims because of hurricane damage. However, the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (TWIA) provides coverage as an \"insurer of last resort.\" Another example would be earthquake insurance in California.\nAgain, be sure to shop around between different providers. Never assume that the first quote you get is the best one. It may take more time and effort upfront, but you could save a lot of money in the long-term.\nBefore signing up for a policy, it helps to know both the benefits and disadvantages of non-standard insurance.\nPro: Easier to Get Approved - If you're a high-risk individual, you'll likely get denied coverage from all the major insurance providers. However, non-standard insurance companies specialize in saying yes to people like you. Some protection is better than nothing, especially when disaster strikes.\nCon: More Expensive - Overall, you'll need to pay higher premiums and deductibles with a non-standard insurance plan. If you have a tight budget, you may need to assess your needs accordingly.\nPro: Avoid Lapses in Coverage - As we mentioned, insurance lapses can be problematic and make you an even higher risk. Getting non-standard insurance now could help you get better coverage later on.\nAs you can see, non-standard insurance can provide peace of mind and enable you to protect your belongings. As long as you take the time to shop around and you know what to expect, you can get suitable coverage for everything that's important to you.<|endoftext|>Firing squad have on Monday executed Alshabaab media representative Hassan Hanafi.\nSenior security officers,members of the public and families of Journalists killed were presented during the execution.\nHanafi whose death sentence appeal by military court was rejected said he was behind the attacks that was targeted on Somali Journalists in 2009 to 2011 in Mogadishu.\nSeveral Journalists were killed under his watch when he was part of Alshabaab media representative in Somalia.\nHassan Hanafi was detained in Kenya and extradited to Somalia for prosecution in 2014 for crimes against the media.\nHuman right groups have condemned the execution mainly carried out by the Somali military court.\n(Xogta): War-murtiyeedka Madasha Wada-tashiga Qaranka & Jadwalka Doorashooyinka.<|endoftext|>Myst is a classic video game graphic adventure.

But, even with all of his professional success, there\u2019s nothing he\u2019s more passionate about than giving back to others.\nLeonard has taught countless people the nuances of real estate investing for free, has bought homes for his parents, donated money and clothes to those in need, and has even loaned money to friends and family expecting nothing in return. He\u2019s done his fair share of giving back in recent times, and he\u2019s still more than willing to help someone to this day.\nLeonard\u2019s business also gives back to the community in a tremendous way. He is the CEO of MyHouseGram.com, a firm that specializes in teaching strategic real estate investing methods including quiet title litigation, wholesale acquisition deals, buying and selling non performing notes, and the basics of flipping homes. His firm also offers credit repair services and business lines of credit as a service, helping clients secure the funding necessary to take action on his real estate teachings.\nHis company\u2019s ability to offer so many financial and investment services under one roof gives them a massive advantage in the industry, as his company\u2019s core values have its client\u2019s best interests in mind. His company\u2019s services allow customers to create multiple streams of income through owning properties without mortgages. This, Leonard says, is the key to true financial success.\nLeonard is also the author of \u201cHood Estate The Manual\u201d, a book that gives the urban community an idea on how to flip properties for massive profits and build real wealth by leveraging credit. He dives into his experiences flipping houses and how he\u2019s learned along the way, including how he was able to flip one of his first properties for 180,000 in profit after taxes.\nLeonard has also learned to become incredibly smart with his money, and is able to write off as many expenses as he can to keep his taxes down. But, he knows all too well that"
